 Rat calf adrenal cortex homogenates found contain three different malic enzymes. Two strictly NADP+-dependent localized, one each, cytosol mitochondrial fractions, respectively. two enzymes appear identical described Simpson Estabrook (Simpson, E. R., Estabrook, R. W. (1969) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 129, 384-395). third NAD(P)+-linked present mitochondrial fraction only. three malic enzymes separated distinct bands electrophoresis 5 percent polyacrylamide slab gels pH 9.0. Marker enzymes mitochondrial malic enzymes migrated together intact mitochondria sucrose density gradient centrifugations despite changes equilibrium position mitochondria promoted energy-dependent calcium phosphate accumulation. adrenal cortex mitochondria subfractionated method Sottocasa et al. (SOTTOCASA, G.L., KUYLENSTIERNA, B., ERNSTER, L., BERGSTAND, A. (1967) J. Cell Biol. 32, 415-438), malic enzymes associated inner membrane-matrix space. Sonication solubilized two malic enzymes along matrix space marker enzymes. NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme purified 100-fold calf adrenal cortex mitochondria. final preparation free malic dehydrogenase, fumarase, strictly NADP+-linked malic enzyme adenylate kinase. Either Mn24 orMg2+ required activity 1 mol pyruvate formed mole NAD+ NADP+ reduced. pH optima NAD+ NADP+ 6.5 tp 7.0 6.0 6.5, respectively. Michaelis-Menten kinetics observed alkaline side. Fumarate, succinate, isocitrate positive ATP ADP negative modulators regulatory enzyme. modulators influence stoichiometry metabolized reaction. Vmax conditions ratios rate NAD+:NADP+ reduction 1.76 1.15 pH 7.4 6.0, respectively. apparent Michaelis constants also differed depending pH coenzyme. pH 7.4 (in presence 5 mM fumarate) pH 6.0 (no fumarate) Km values (-)-malate, NAD+, Mn2+ 1.7, 0.16, 0.15 mM, 0.31, 0.06, 0.09 mM, respectively. pH 7.4 (5MM fumarate) pH 6.0 (no fumarate), Km values (-)-malate, NADP+, Mn2+ 6.5, 0.62, 0.59 mM, 0.68. 0.12, 0.31 mM, respectively. apparent Ki values ATP NAD+ NADP+ coenzyme 0.42 0.27 mM, respectively.
