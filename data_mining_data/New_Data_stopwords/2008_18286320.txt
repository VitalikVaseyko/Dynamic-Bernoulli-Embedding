 Homozygous mutations PINK1 gene shown cause early-onset parkinsonism. Here, describe novel homozygous mutation (Q126P), identified two affected German sisters clinical phenotype typical PINK1-associated parkinsonism. analysed lactate, pyruvate, carnitine acylcarnitine blood levels, lactate levels exercise cerebrospinal fluid, activity respiratory chain complexes I-IV muscle biopsies proteasomal activity immortalized lymphoblasts, found evidence mitochondrial proteasomal dysfunction. MR spectroscopy revealed raised myoinositol levels basal ganglia patients, reflecting possible astroglial proliferation.
