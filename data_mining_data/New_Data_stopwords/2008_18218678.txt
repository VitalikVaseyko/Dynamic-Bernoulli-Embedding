 characteristic manifestation sepsis muscle lactate accumulation. study examined putative (causative) association pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) inhibition lactate accumulation extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle rats infused lipopolysaccharide (LPS), explored involvement increased transcription muscle-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes. Conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats infused i.v. saline (0.4 ml h(-1), control) LPS (150 mug kg(-1) h(-1)) 2 h, 6 h 24 h (n = 6-8). Muscle lactate concentration elevated 2, 6 24 h LPS infusion. Muscle PDC activity 2 h 6 h, 65% lower 24 h LPS infusion (P < 0.01), 47% decrease acetylcarnitine concentration (P < 0.05), 24-fold increase PDK4 mRNA expression (P < 0.001). changes preceded marked increases tumour necrosis factor-alpha interleukin-6 mRNA expression 2 h. findings indicate early (2 6 h) elevation muscle lactate concentration LPS infusion attributable limited muscle oxygen availability ATP production (evidenced unchanged ATP phosphocreatine (PCr) concentrations) PDC inhibition, whereas 24 h, muscle lactate accumulation appears resulted PDC activation status limiting pyruvate flux, probably due cytokine-mediated up-regulation PDK4 transcription.
