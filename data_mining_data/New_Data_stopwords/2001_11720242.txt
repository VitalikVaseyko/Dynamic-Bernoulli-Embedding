 question whether estrogens estrogen-like compounds would alter differentially enzymatic activity FOF1-ATPase addressed. Mitochondrial fractions liver, brain, heart obtained adult male rats solubilized digitonin. 85% adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis three preparations come mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase. enzymatic activity differed following order: liver < brain < heart. concentration 13 nM estradiol stimulated FOF1-ATPase activity heart 10% (p < 0.01), liver brain. 17beta-estradiol competed binding estradiol-17beta-17-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime:125I-labeled bovine serium albumin mitochondrial preparations heart, revealing two binding sites. Resveratrol inhibited F0F1-ATPase activity heart liver IC50 13-15 microM, confirmed previous report preparations brain. Lower doses (picomolar nanomolar) resveratrol stimulated FOF1-ATPase activity liver 10% heart. 6.7 microM, diethylstilbestrol (DES) inhibited FOF1-ATPase activity three preparations 61-67%. study demonstrates estradiol activates rat heart mitochondrial FOF1-ATPase physiologic concentrations FOF1-ATPase activity markedly different rat liver, brain, heart. addition, estradiol, DES, resveratrol alter FOF1-ATPase activity selectively, probably via different mechanisms.
