 Werner syndrome protein (WRN) nuclear protein required cell growth proliferation. Loss-of-function mutations Werner syndrome gene associated premature onset age-related diseases. loss WRN limits cell proliferation induces replicative senescence poorly understood. Here, show WRN depletion leads striking metabolic shift coordinately weakens pathways generate reducing equivalents detoxification reactive oxygen species increases mitochondrial respiration. cancer cells, metabolic shift counteracts Warburg effect, defining characteristic many malignant cells, resulting altered redox balance accumulation oxidative DNA damage inhibits cell proliferation induces senescence-like phenotype. Consistent findings, supplementation antioxidant rescues least part cell proliferation decreases senescence WRN-knockdown cancer cells. results demonstrate WRN plays critical role cancer cell proliferation contributing Warburg effect preventing metabolic stress.
