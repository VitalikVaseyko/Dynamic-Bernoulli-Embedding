 1. Monochloroacetate, dichloroacetate, trichloroacetate, difluoroacetate, 2-chloropropionate, 2,2'-dichloropropionate 3-chloropropionate inhibitors pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Dichloroacetate also shown inhibit rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. inhibition mainly non-competitive respect ATP. concentration required 50% inhibition approx. 100mum three chloroacetates, difluoroacetate 2-chloropropionate 2,2'-dichloropropionate. Dichloroacetamide inhibitory. 2. Dichloroacetate significant effect activity pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase maximally activated Ca(2+) Mg(2+). 3. Dichloroacetate increase catalytic activity purified pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase. 4. Dichloroacetate, difluoroacetate, 2-chloropropionate 2,2'-dichloropropionate increased proportion active (dephosphorylated) form pyruvate dehydrogenase rat heart mitochondria 2-oxoglutarate malate respiratory substrates. Similar effects dichloroacetate shown kidney fat-cell mitochondria. Glyoxylate, monochloroacetate dichloroacetamide inactive. 5. Dichloroacetate increased proportion active pyruvate dehydrogenase perfused rat heart, isolated rat diaphragm rat epididymal fat-pads. Difluoroacetate dichloroacetamide also active perfused heart, glyoxylate, monochloroacetate trichloroacetate inactive. 6. Injection dichloroacetate rats starved overnight led within 60 min activation pyruvate dehydrogenase extracts heart, psoas muscle, adipose tissue, kidney liver. blood concentration lactate fell within 15 min reach minimum 60 min. blood concentration glucose fell 90 min reached minimum 120 min. significant change plasma glycerol concentration. 7. epididymal fatpads dichloroacetate inhibited incorporation (14)C [U-(14)C]glucose, [U-(14)C]fructose [U-(14)C]lactate CO(2) glyceride fatty acid. 8. concluded inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase dichloroacetate may account activation pyruvate dehydrogenase pyruvate oxidation induces isolated rat heart diaphragm muscles, subject certain assumptions distribution dichloroacetate across plasma membrane mitochondrial membrane. 9. suggested activation pyruvate dehydrogenase dichloroacetate could contribute hypoglycaemic effect interruption Cori alanine cycles. 10. suggested inhibitory effect dichloroacetate fatty acid synthesis adipose tissue may involve additional effect effects compound.
