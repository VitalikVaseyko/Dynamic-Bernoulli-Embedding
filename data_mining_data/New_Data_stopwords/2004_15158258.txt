 metabolic regulation Escherichia coli lacking functional pykF gene investigated based gene expressions, enzyme activities, intracellular metabolite concentrations metabolic flux distribution obtained based (13)C-labeling experiments. RT-PCR revealed glycolytic genes glk, pgi, pfkA tpiA regulated, ppc, pckA, maeB mdh genes strongly up-regulated, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway genes zwf gnd significantly up-regulated pykF mutant. catabolite repressor/activator gene fruR up-regulated pykF mutant, adenylate cyclase gene cyaA down-regulated indicating decreased rate glucose uptake. also ascertained degradation ptsG mRNA, gene down-regulated pykF mutant. general, changes enzyme activities less correlated ratios gene expression, changes metabolic fluxes correlate enzyme activities. example, high flux ratios obtained oxidative pentose phosphate pathway due increased concentration glucose-6-phosphate rather favorable enzyme activity ratios. contrast, due decreased availability pyruvate (and acetyl coenzyme A) pykF mutant compared wild type, low flux ratios found lactate acetate forming pathways.
