 VEGF antagonists widely used cancer therapeutics, predictive biomarkers response toxicity remain unavailable. study, analyzed effects anti-VEGF therapy tumor metabolism therapeutic response using integrated set imaging techniques, including bioluminescence metabolic imaging, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, MRI imaging spectroscopy. results revealed anti-VEGF therapy caused dramatic depletion glucose exhaustion ATP levels tumors, although glucose uptake maintained. metabolic changes selectively accompanied presence large necrotic areas partial tumor regression highly glycolytic tumors. addition, found central metabolic protein kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-a cellular sensor ATP levels supports cell viability response energy stress-was activated anti-VEGF therapy experimental tumors. AMPK-alpha2 attenuation increased glucose consumption, tumor cell sensitivity glucose starvation, tumor necrosis following anti-VEGF therapy. Taken together, findings reveal functional links Warburg effect AMPK pathway therapeutic responses VEGF neutralization tumor xenograft models.
