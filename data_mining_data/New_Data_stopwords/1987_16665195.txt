 O(2) electrode system specially designed chamber ;whorl' cell complexes Chara corallina used study combined effects inorganic carbon O(2) concentrations photosynthetic O(2) evolution. pH = 5.5 20% O(2), cells grown HCO(3) (-) medium (low CO(2), pH >/= 9.0) exhibited higher affinity external CO(2) (K((1/2))(CO(2)) = 40 +/- 6 micromolar) cells grown least 24 hours high-CO(2) medium (pH = 6.5), (K((1/2))(CO(2)) = 94 +/- 16 micromolar). O(2) </= 2% contrast, types cells showed high apparent affinity (K((1/2))(CO(2)) = 50 - 52 micromolar). Warburg effect detectable low affinity cells previously cultivated high-CO(2) medium (pH = 6.5). high-pH, HCO(3) (-)-grown cells, exposed low pH (5.5) conditions, exhibited response indicating ability fix CO(2) exceeded CO(2) externally supplied, reverse situation observed high-CO(2)-grown cells. pH 8.2, apparent photosynthetic affinity external HCO(3) (-) (K((1/2))[HCO(3) (-)]) 0.6 +/- 0.2 millimolar, 20% O(2). low O(2) concentrations (</=2%), surprisingly, inhibition net O(2) evolution elicited, maximal low HCO(3) (-) concentrations. results indicate that: (a) photorespiration occurs alga revealed cultivation high-CO(2) medium, (b) Chara cells able accumulate CO(2) internally means process apparently independent plasmalemma HCO(3) (-) transport system, (c) molecular oxygen appears required photosynthetic utilization exogenous HCO(3) (-): pseudocyclic electron flow, sustained O(2) photoreduction, may produce additional ATP needed HCO(3) (-) transport.
