 Insulinoma beta-cells capable overexpressing glucokinase control doxycycline-dependent transcriptional transactivator established parental INS-1 cells. Glucokinase could maximally induced level 20 times basal level 36 h culture doxycycline. Intermediate levels induction could achieved varying doses of, time culture with, inducer. rate glycolysis measured cells 3-, 5-, 8-fold increment glucokinase activity noninduced level. Proportionate increases glycolytic flux occurred cells cultured low physiological glucose concentration. high glucose concentration, induction glucokinase excess 2-fold basal resulted little additional increase glycolysis. consequences graded increases glucokinase two physiological glucose effects investigated. Increments glucokinase activity accompanied stepwise shift left dose-response curve inductive effect glucose L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. Similarly, insulin secretory response glucose shifted leftward glucokinase-induced cells. following conclusions drawn: (i) glucokinase major rate-limiting enzyme glycolysis cells; (ii) downstream metabolic steps become limiting high extracellular glucose concentration moderate increases glucokinase wild-type level; (iii) within limits, glucokinase activity determining factor two types glucose responses beta-cell, induction specific gene expression, insulin release.
