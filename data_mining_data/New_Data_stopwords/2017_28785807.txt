 long-recognized fact oxidative stress within mitochondria hallmark mitochondrial dysfunction stimulated development mitochondria-targeted antioxidant therapies. Melatonin included among pharmacological agents able modulate mitochondrial functions cancer, given number relevant melatonin-dependent effects triggered targeting mitochondrial functions. Indeed, melatonin may modulate mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus antagonizing cancer highly glycolytic bioenergetic pathway cancer cells. Modulation mitochondrial respiratory chain, together Ca(2+) release mitochondrial apoptotic effectors, may enhance spontaneous drug-induced apoptotic processes. Given melatonin may efficiently counteract Warburg effect stimulating mitochondrial differentiation mitochondrial-based apoptosis, argued pineal neurohormone could represent promising new perspective cancer treatment strategy.
