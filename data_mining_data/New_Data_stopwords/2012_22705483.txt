 Hybridization potential exert pleiotropic effects metabolism. Effects mitochondrial enzymes may arise incompatibilities nuclear- mitochondrial-encoded subunits enzyme complexes oxidative phosphorylation. explored metabolic phenotype bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), unidirectional F(1) hybrids (male bluegill x female pumpkinseed). hybrids, glycolytic enzyme activities indistinguishable (aldolase, pyruvate kinase) intermediate (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase) parentals, complex IV activities aligned pumpkinseed, 30% lower bluegill. isolated mitochondria, specific activities complexes I, II, V indistinguishable groups. However, complex III IV showed indications depressed activities hybrid mitochondria, though effects mitochondrial state 3 state 4 respiration apparent. patterns complex IV activities due differences enzyme content rather enzyme V(max); immunoblots comparing complex IV content catalytic activity indistinguishable groups. sequence differences complex IV catalytic subunits (CO1, CO2, CO3) minor nature; however, mtDNA-encoded subunit complex III (cytochrome b) showed eight differences bluegill pumpkinseed, several could structural consequences multimeric enzyme, contributing depressed complex III catalytic activity hybrids.
