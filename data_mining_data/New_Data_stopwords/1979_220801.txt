 ratio two substrates (pyruvate lactate), activity enzymes, responsible turnover liver tissue, sceletal muscles blood, studied simultaneously experiments effect hydroxythiamin, administered doses, causing state hypovitaminosis B1. Hydroxythiamin shown inhibit specifically activity thiamin-dependent enzymes (transketolase pyruvate dehydrogenase). affected also metabolism triose phosphates, pyruvate lactate. time, hydroxythiamin responsible changes activities enzymes, participating turnover substrates studied.
