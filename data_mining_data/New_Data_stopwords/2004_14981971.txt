 study presents data comparing relatively new tumor metabolic marker Tumor-M2-PK established markers CEA, CA 19-9 CA 72-4 diagnosis gastrointestinal cancers. prospective study histologically confirmed n = 250 colorectal, n = 122 gastric, n = 86 oesophageal n = 24 pancreatic cancer patients investigated compared n = 76 control persons without malignant disease. Tumor M2-PK measured plasma ELISA. CEA, CA 19-9 CA 72-4 determined sera autoanalyser. Significantly elevated tumor marker concentrations detected tumor patients suffering colorectal, gastric, oesophageal pancreatic cancers. patients colorectal cancer Tumor M2-PK significantly frequently elevated (47.8%), followed CEA (33.6%) CA19-9 (30.4%). gastric cancers, sensitivity Tumor M2-PK (57.0%) CA 72-4 (60.7%) comparable higher CA19-9 (45.5%) CEA (23.8%). oesophageal cancers, Tumor M2-PK frequently elevated (55.8%) followed CA 72-4 (53.5%), CA 19-9 (27.9%) CEA (14.5%). pancreatic cancer patients, sensitivities CA 19-9 (87.5%), Tumor M2-PK (72.9%) CEA (33.3%). discrimination power (demonstrated AUC) Tumor M2-PK superior colorectal, gastric oesophageal cancers without distant metastasis. Also CA 72-4 superior CA 19-9 CEA detection gastric oesophageal cancer patients. CEA bore relevant information detection localised cancers. present data indicate Tumor M2-PK could valuable tumor marker detection gastrointestinal cancers.
