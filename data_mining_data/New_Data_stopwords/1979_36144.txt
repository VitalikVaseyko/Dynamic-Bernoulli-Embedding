 D-Gluconate uptake studied whole cells Arthrobacter pyridinolis; uptake activity inducible, mutable showed saturation kinetics (Km = 5 micrometer). Uptake D-gluconate mediated phosphoenol-pyruvate : hexose phosphotransferase system, directly energized ATP. transmembrane pH gradient, delta pH, --63 mV generated A. pyridinolis cells pH 6.5, pH 7.5, delta pH = 0. Addition 8 micrometer D-gluconate significantly reduced delta pH. transmembrane electrical potential, delta psi, --87 mV range pH 5.5 7.5, unaffected presence substrate. D-Gluconate accumulated rate protonated solute, pH 6.5 7.5. Experiments diffusion potential generated cyanide-treated cells, indicated delta psi energize transport. Rather, rate D-gluconate uptake metabolism: (a) treatment cells valinomycin nigericin, conditions loss intracellular potassium, inhibited D-gluconate uptake metabolism pre-accumulated D-gluconate; (b) effects cyanide azide D-gluconate uptake much severe pH 6.5 pH 7.5, pattern paralleled effects inhibitors D-gluconate metabolism; (c) extraction chromatography intracellular label D-gluconate uptake revealed accumulation unaltered D-gluconate negligible; (d) series mutant strains lower D-gluconate kinase activities also exhibited low rates D-gluconate uptake; (e) spontaneous revertants mutant strains consistently regained D-gluconate kinase activity wild type levels uptake.
