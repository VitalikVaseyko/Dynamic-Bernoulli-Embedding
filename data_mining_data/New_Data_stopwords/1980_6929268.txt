 effects high fat diet (30% (w/w) corn oil) chronic streptozotocin-diabetic rats investigated whole body level enzyme level. diet caused significant decreases extent polydipsia (66% decrease), polyphagia (49%), polyuria (67%) glycosuria (70%). activities selected hepatic enzymes glycolytic, gluconeogenic, ureogenic lipogenic clusters determined. fat diet caused significant decreases (range: 47 54%) activity ureogenic enzymes carbamyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase arginase; effect glycolytic enzymes glucokinase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase; partially decreased diabetes-induced elevated activities gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (63% decrease), serine dehydratase (90%), alanine aminotransferase (31%) aspartate aminotransferase (65%), partially reversed activity one lipogenic enzyme, ATP citrate lyase.
