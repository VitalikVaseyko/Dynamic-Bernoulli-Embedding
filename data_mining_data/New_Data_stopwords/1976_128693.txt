 Clinical hematological studies performed ten homozygous seven heterozytous individuals pyruvate kinase deficiency, aged 2 71 years. Five homozygotes splenectomized. exception decreased enzyme activity 41 55 per cent minor changes red cell metabolism heterozygotes showed abnormal results. homozygotes following results could demonstrated: 1. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased 11 35 per cent normal enzyme activity. 2. relation severity hemolysis degree enzyme defect. 3. reticulocyte counts correlated inversely hemoglobin concentrations. 4. close correlation activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glutamate oxalacetate transaminase one side reticulocyte counts other. 5. Adenosine triphosphate adenosine reduced increased autohemolysis cases. 6. Following splenectomy, anemia less pronounced before. Splenectomized patients need transfusions, though hemolysis persisted.
