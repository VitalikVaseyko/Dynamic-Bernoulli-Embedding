 Fibrates, ligands peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), used class lipid-lowering drugs clinical practice treatment dyslipidemia. Fibrates well tolerated cases concomitantly occasional adverse reactions including muscular toxicity, enhanced combination statins. study designed investigate effects bezafibrate PPARalpha agonist human embryo rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells possible mechanisms responsible bezafibrate-mediated myopathy. results revealed bezafibrate caused dose-dependent decrease cell viability, fortified association atorvastatin pharmacological dose. Bezafibrate toxic doses 300 1000microM upregulated PPARalpha mRNA level, counteracted PPARalpha antagonist (MK886). Bezafibrate toxic dose induced typical apoptotic characteristics related inhibition phosphorylation Akt blocked PPARalpha antagonist. Toxic doses bezafibrate initiated significant increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA protein levels, compromised MK886. results suggest critical roles PPARalpha signaling bezafibrate-induced myotoxicity involvement apoptosis Akt pathway.
