 Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) key enzyme metabolism linking glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle activity tightly regulated phosphorylation catalyzed four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms. PDKs pharmacological targets several human diseases including cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, inherited PDHC deficiency. investigated inhibitory activity phenylbutyrate toward PDKs found PDK isoforms 1-to-3 inhibited whereas PDK4 unaffected. Moreover, docking studies revealed putative binding sites phenylbutyrate PDK2 3 located different sites compared dichloroacetate (DCA), previously known PDK inhibitor. Based findings, showed cells mice phenylbutyrate combined DCA results greater increase PDHC activity compared drug alone. results suggest therapeutic efficacy enhanced combination drugs increasing PDHC enzyme activity.
