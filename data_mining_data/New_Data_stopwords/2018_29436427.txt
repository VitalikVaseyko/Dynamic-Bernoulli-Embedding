 Downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) critical aberrant preferential activation glycolysis cancer cells normoxic conditions. Phosphorylation-dependent inhibition PDH relevant event process, durable since relies PDH kinases activated ordinarily hypoxic conditions. Thus, remains unclear PDH durably downregulated cancer cells hypoxic. Building evidence PDH activity depends stability multi-protein PDH complex, found PDH-E1beta subunit PDH complex downregulated inhibit PDH activity conditions prolonged hypoxia. restoration normoxic conditions, reduced expression PDH-E1beta sustained glycolysis remained highly activated. Notably, PDH-E1beta silencing cancer cells produced metabolic state strongly resembling Warburg effect, inhibited tumor growth. Conversely, enforced exogenous expression PDH-E1beta durably increased PDH activity promoted malignant growth breast cancer cells vivo. Taken together, results establish specific mechanism PDH acts oncogenic factor tuning glycolytic metabolism cancer cells.
