 PURPOSE: assess feasibility using hybrid Maximum-Entropy/Nonlinear Least Squares (MEM/NLS) method analyzing kinetics hyperpolarized dynamic data minimum priori knowledge. THEORY METHODS: continuous distribution rates obtained Laplace inversion data used constraint NLS fitting derive discrete spectrum rates. Performance MEM/NLS algorithm assessed Monte Carlo simulations validated fitting longitudinal relaxation time curves hyperpolarized [1-(13) C] pyruvate acquired 9.4 Tesla three different flip angles. method used assess kinetics hyperpolarized pyruvate-lactate exchange acquired vitro whole blood re-analyze previously published vitro reaction hyperpolarized (15) N choline choline kinase. RESULTS: MEM/NLS method found adequate kinetic characterization hyperpolarized vitro time-series. Additional insights obtained experimental data blood well previously published (15) N choline experimental data. CONCLUSION: proposed method informs compartmental model best approximate biological system observed using hyperpolarized (13) C MR especially metabolic pathway assessed complex new hyperpolarized probe used.
