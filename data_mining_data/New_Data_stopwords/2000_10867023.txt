 Creatine kinase (CK) exists family isoenzymes excitable tissue. studied isolated perfused hearts mice lacking genes either main muscle isoform CK (M-CK) M-CK main mitochondrial isoform (Mt-CK) determine 1) biological significance CK isoenzyme shifts, 2) necessity maintaining high CK reaction rate, 3) role CK isoenzymes establishing thermodynamics ATP hydrolysis. (31)P NMR used measure [ATP], [PCr], [P(i)], [ADP], pH, well unidirectional reaction rate PCr--> [gamma-P]ATP. Developmental changes main fetal isoform CK (BB-CK) unaffected loss CK isoenzymes. hearts lacking M- Mt-CK, rate ATP synthesis PCr 9% rate ATP synthesis oxidative phosphorylation demonstrating lack high energy phosphate shuttle. also found intrinsic activities BB-CK MM-CK isoenzymes equivalent. Finally, combined loss M- Mt-CK (but loss M-CK) prevented amount free energy released ATP hydrolysis increasing pyruvate provided substrate oxidative phosphorylation.
