 Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency frequent enzyme abnormality glycolytic pathway causing hereditary non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. degree haemolysis varies widely, ranging mild fully compensated forms, life-threatening neonatal anaemia jaundice necessitating exchange transfusions. Erythrocyte PK synthesized control PK-LR gene located chromosome 1. date, 150 different mutations PK-LR gene associated PK deficiency. First attempts delineate biochemical clinical consequences molecular defect mainly based observation homozygous patients analysis three-dimensional structure enzyme. recently, comparison recombinant mutants human red cell PK wild-type enzyme enabled effects amino acid replacements enzyme molecular properties determined help correlate genotype clinical phenotype.
