 Two preparations L'/R-type pyruvate kinase human erythrocytes characterized SDS-PAGE used immunization BALB/c mice. spleen cells fused mouse myeloma cells polyethylene glycol according standard techniques. Supernatants hybridomas resulting two separate experiments assayed ELISA characterized immunoblotting. Using monoclonal antibodies reacting L'/R-PK immunoblotting, major band 62 KDa MW recognized preparations employed immunization. Additionally, four smaller bands detected. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies also detected single band 62 KDa MW highly purified L-PK prepared human liver. contrast, showed reaction muscle brain tissues containing M1-type PK. However, reacted strongly single band approximately 62 KDa liver kidney homogenates line immunocytochemical studies showing immunoreactive material hepatocytes proximal tubules kidney.
