 serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) initially identified putative inhibitor canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway. Smad-dependent TGF-beta pathway negatively regulates cellular growth, early functional studies suggested STRAP behaves oncogene. Indeed, correlation STRAP overexpression various cancers identified. emergence new studies biological function STRAP, becoming clear STRAP regulates several distinct cellular processes modulates multiple signaling pathways. STRAP possess enzymatic activity, appears STRAP influences biological processes associations cellular proteins. review, describe TGF-beta-dependent -independent functions STRAP provide context significance STRAP activity development cancer.
