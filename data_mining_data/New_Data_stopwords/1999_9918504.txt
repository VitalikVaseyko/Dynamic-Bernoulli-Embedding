 Cytosolic fractions B (salted 51-70% ammonium sulphate saturation) rat liver Morris hepatoma 7777, containing pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) M2 isoenzymes, purified affinity chromatography Blue Sepharose CL-6B. compared polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pH 8.3, three M2 pyruvate kinase variants Morris hepatoma 7777 lower mobilities (alpha2, beta2, gamma3) three corresponding variants (alpha1, beta1, gamma2) normal rat liver. Using automatic amino-acid analyser, significant differences selected amino-acid content found corresponding highly purified gamma3 gamma2 variants Morris hepatoma normal rat liver, respectively. gamma3-variant Morris hepatoma M2 isoenzyme twice amount L-tyrosine L-cysteine, content L-serine higher 20% corresponding gamma2 variant normal rat liver M2 isoenzyme. contained, however, significantly less dicarboxylic amino acids explains lower electrophoretic mobility. showed also decrease (by 10%) several amino-acid content, corresponding 10% decrease tumour enzyme molecular mass.
