 BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) increased inflamed colonic mucosa role immune regulation apoptosis resistance. Fecal OPG may useful predicting corticosteroid resistance hospitalized children severe ulcerative colitis (UC). aimed determine whether fecal OPG predicts need second-line therapies children hospitalized UC. METHODS: included 83 children UC admitted intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Children classified responders/nonresponders based need therapy escalation. Fecal OPG results compared four fecal markers. RESULTS: enrolled children, seven day 1 samples only, 53 children day 3 samples only, 23 both. Twenty-two children failed corticosteroid therapy required infliximab (n = 20) colectomy (n = 2). third treatment day median fecal OPG levels significantly higher nonresponders group compared responders: 77 pmol/L (interquartile range [IQR] 27-137) versus 13 pmol/L (3-109); P = 0.007. best day 3 fecal OPG cutoff predict second-line therapy >50 pmol/L sensitivity 71% specificity 69% (area receiver operator curve [ROC] 0.70%-95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.82). Fecal OPG superior day 3 fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, S100A12 predictor corticosteroid nonresponse, equivalent less commonly used M2-pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSIONS: Day 3 fecal OPG may guide decision institute second-line therapy children severe UC. role OPG inflammatory response pediatric UC deserves study.
