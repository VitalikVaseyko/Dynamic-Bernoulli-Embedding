 Torrent ducks inhabit fast-flowing rivers Andes sea level altitudes 4500 m. examined mitochondrial physiology facilitates performance altitudinal cline comparing respiratory capacities permeabilized fibers, activities 16 key metabolic enzymes myoglobin content muscles high- low-altitude populations species. Mitochondrial respiratory capacities (assessed using substrates mitochondrial complexes I, II and/or IV) higher highland ducks gastrocnemius muscle - primary muscle used support swimming diving - similar populations pectoralis muscle left ventricle. heightened respiratory capacity gastrocnemius highland ducks associated elevated activities cytochrome oxidase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Although respiratory capacities similar populations muscles, highland ducks elevated activities ATP synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, MDH, hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase creatine kinase left ventricle, elevated MDH activity myoglobin content pectoralis. Thus, although significant increase oxidative capacity gastrocnemius highland ducks, correlates improved performance high altitudes, variation metabolic enzyme activities muscles correlated respiratory capacity, consistent upregulation MDH activity, may serve functions contribute success high altitudes.
