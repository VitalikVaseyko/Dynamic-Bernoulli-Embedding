 Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) recently discovered transcription factor whose levels activity increased glucose leading activation target genes, include acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, liver-type pyruvate kinase. Here, demonstrate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment causes marked decrease ChREBP mRNA protein levels liver mice fed normal chow diet mice fasted 24 h re-fed high carbohydrate diet. decrease occurs rapidly sensitive response (half-maximal dose 0.1 mug/mouse). decrease ChREBP accompanied decrease expression ChREBP target genes. Zymosan turpentine treatment also decrease hepatic ChREBP levels expression target genes. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) decrease liver ChREBP expression vivo Hep3B cells culture. Finally, LPS decreased ChREBP expression muscle adipose tissue. studies demonstrate ChREBP down-regulated acute phase response resulting alterations expression ChREBP regulated target genes. Thus, ChREBP joins growing list transcription factors regulated acute phase response.
