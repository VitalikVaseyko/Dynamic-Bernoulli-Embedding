 BACKGROUND: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) family three (PPARalpha, -beta/delta, -gamma) nuclear receptors. particular, PPARalpha involved regulation fatty acid metabolism, cell growth inflammation. PPARalpha mediates cardiac fasting response, increasing fatty acid metabolism, decreasing glucose utilisation, target fibrate lipid-lowering class drugs. However, little known regarding endogenous generation PPAR ligands. CYP2J2 lipid metabolising cytochrome P450, produces anti-inflammatory mediators, considered major epoxygenase human heart. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Expression CYP2J2 vitro results activation PPAR responses particular preference PPARalpha. CYP2J2 products 8,9- 11-12-EET also activate PPARalpha. vitro, PPARalpha activation selective ligand induces PPARalpha target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4 cardiac tissue. vivo, cardiac-specific CYP2J2 transgenic mice, fasting selectively augments expression PDK4. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: results establish CYP2J2 produces PPARalpha ligands vitro vivo, suggests lipid metabolising CYPs prime candidates integration global lipid changes transcriptional signalling events.
