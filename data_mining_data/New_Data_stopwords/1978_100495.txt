 report, compared homogeneous yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) pyruvate kinase enzyme cell-free extracts several different ways: 1) isoelectric focusing cell-free extracts indicates one peak pyruvate kinase activity whose isoelectric point pure enzyme; 2) antibody prepared pure enzyme produces single, fused precipitin line enzyme cell-free extract pure enzyme; 3) immunoelectrophoresis cell-free extract produces one precipitin arc mobility pure enzyme; 4) immunoprecipitation pure enzyme cell-free extract subsequent solubilization 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels produces single protein band attributable pyruvate kinase co-migrates purified enzyme. Within limits sensitivity methods employed, conclude homogeneous pyruvate kinase prepared yeast lysed either Manton-Gaulin homogenization (Aust, A., Yun, S.-L., Suelter, C. (1975) Methods Enzymol. 42, 176-182) toluolysis (Yun, S.-L., Aust, A.E., Suelter, C.H. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 124-128) identical pyruvate kinase cell-free extract.
