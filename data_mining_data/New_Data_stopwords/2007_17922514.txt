 Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine known long time prevent tuberculosis (TB) worldwide since 1921. Nonetheless, know little BCG membrane proteome. present study, utilized alkaline incubation Triton X-114-based methods enrich BCG membrane proteins subsequently digested using proteolytic enzyme. recovered peptides separated 2-D LC identified ESI-MS/MS. result, total 474 proteins identified, including 78 integral membrane proteins (IMPs). Notably, 18 BCG IMPs described first time mycobacterium. analysis 78 IMPs indicated theoretical molecular mass distribution ranged 8.06 167.86 kDa pI scores ranged 4.40 11.60. Functional classification revealed large proportion identified IMPs (67.9%, 53 78) involved cell wall cell processes functional group. conclusion, reported comprehensive profile BCG membrane subproteome. present investigation may allow identification valuable vaccine drug target candidates thus provide basement future designing preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic strategies TB.
