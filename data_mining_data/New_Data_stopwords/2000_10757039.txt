 strong coordinated upregulation glycolytic, glutaminolytic pentose phosphate pathway enzymes occurs onset lactation normal mouse mammary gland. Induction apoptosis removing pups led inactivation enzymes different time courses. ATP-consuming glycolytic 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase mitochondrial bound hexokinase still remained high days one two involution, ATP-regenerating pyruvate kinase immediately reduced. enzymes pentose phosphate glutaminolytic pathway inactivated first two days involution. accordance inactivation enzymes ATP, GTP, UTP, ADP, NAD NADH lactate concentrations decreased. synthetic product UTP, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, increased. AMP found milk, epithelial cells. inactivation enzymes caused partial proteolysis loss intact proteins cytosol without signs proteolysis.
