 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) frequent esophageal tumor world. ESCC presents late diagnosis, highly aggressive behavior poor survival. Changes tumor cell energy metabolism appear prominent role malignant transformation. Tumor cells consume glucose avidly produce lactic acid, even normoxia. Among factors may contribute stimulation glycolysis tumor cells, changes glycolytic pathway enzymes as: pyruvate kinase M1 M2 (PKM2 PKM1), hexokinase II (HKII), glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT-1), transcription factor induced hypoxia (HIF1alpha), responsible transcription proteins cited. objective study evaluate alterations proteins association clinicopathological data ESCC. performed immunohistochemistry determine HIF-1alpha, GLUT-1, PKM1, PKM2, HK2 Ki67-expression ESCC patients controls. Also, used RT-qPCR evaluated mRNA expression GLUT-1 esophageal mucosa individuals without cancer, alcohol drinkers tobacco smokers. results showed exclusively expression GLUT-1 tumors cells dysplastic samples. also observed compartmentalization expression PKM1 PKM2 relation tumor cells stroma associated tumor areas. proteins evaluated, excepted GLUT-1, frequently detected normal mucosa. correlations clinicopathological features protein expressions observed. GLUT-1 expression appears initial tumor lesions maintained ESCC evolution. reported first time PKM1 staining normal esophagus ESCC, mostly present differentiated cells.
