 studied relationship growth rate genome-wide gene expression, cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism 36 steady-state continuous cultures limited one six different nutrients (glucose, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil, leucine). expression one quarter yeast genes linearly correlated growth rate, independent limiting nutrient. subset negatively growth-correlated genes enriched peroxisomal functions, whereas positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions. Many (not all) genes associated stress response strongly correlated growth rate, genes periodically expressed conditions metabolic cycling. confirmed linear relationship growth rate fraction cell population G0/G1 cell cycle phase, independent limiting nutrient. Cultures limited auxotrophic requirements wasted excess glucose, whereas limited phosphate, sulfate, ammonia not; phenomenon (reminiscent "Warburg effect" cancer cells) confirmed batch cultures. Using aggregate gene expression values, predict (in continuous batch cultures) "instantaneous growth rate." concept useful interpreting system-level connections among growth rate, metabolism, stress, cell cycle.
