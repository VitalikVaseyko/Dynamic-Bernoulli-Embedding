 Increased uptake glucose, general hallmark malignant tumors, leads accumulation intermediate metabolites glycolysis. investigated whether high supply intermediates promotes flow UDP-sugars, consequently hyaluronan, tumor-promoting matrix molecule. quantified UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) human breast cancer biopsies, levels enzymes contributing synthesis, association hyaluronan accumulation tumor. content UDP-GlcUA 4 times, UDP-GlcNAc 12 times higher tumors compared normal glandular tissue obtained breast reductions. surge UDP-GlcNAc correlated elevated mRNA expression glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 2 (GFAT2), one key enzymes biosynthesis UDP-GlcNAc, expression GFAT1 also elevated. contents UDP-sugars strongly correlated tumor hyaluronan levels. Interestingly, hyaluronan content correlate mRNA levels hyaluronan synthases (HAS1-3), thus emphasizing role UDP-sugar substrates enzymes. UDP-sugars showed trend higher levels ductal vs. lobular cancer subtypes. results reveal first time dramatic increase UDP-sugars breast cancer, suggest high supply drives accumulation hyaluronan, known promoter breast cancer malignancies. general, study shows disturbed glucose metabolism typical malignant tumors influence cancer microenvironment UDP-sugars hyaluronan.
