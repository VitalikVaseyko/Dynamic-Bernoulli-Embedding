 OBJECTIVES: stabilization transcription factor prognostic tumor marker hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) considered crucial cellular metabolic adaptations hypoxia. However, HIF1alpha also shown accumulate normoxic conditions, although phenomenon poorly understood. METHODS: investigated conditions normoxic HIF1alpha stabilization different tumor cell lines (e.g., two mammary carcinoma cell lines three oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines) via Western blot analysis immunohistochemical staining. transcriptional activity HIF1 demonstrated analyzing messenger RNA (mRNA) expression HIF1 target carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) via PCR. RESULTS: data demonstrate combined incubation tumor cells glutamine growth factors (e.g., EGF, insulin, serum) mediates normoxic accumulation HIF1alpha vitro. Consequently, inhibition glutaminolysis glutaminase inhibitor blocked normoxic accumulation HIF1alpha. Additionally, normoxic HIF1alpha protein displayed nuclear translocation transcriptional activity, confirmed induction CA9 mRNA expression. Furthermore, normoxic accumulation HIF1alpha associated impaired proliferation tumor cells. Finally, ammonia, toxic waste product glutaminolysis, induced normoxic accumulation HIF1alpha extent glutamine. CONCLUSION: study suggests HIF1alpha involved regulation glutamine metabolism cellular levels toxic metabolic waste product ammonia normoxia. Hence, results, together data presented literature, support hypothesis HIF1alpha target genes play crucial role metabolic pathways, glutaminolysis glycolysis, hypoxic normoxic conditions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Therefore, inhibition HIF1alpha (and/or HIF1alpha target genes) could emerge promising therapeutic approach would result accumulation toxic metabolic waste products tumor cells well reduction nutrition energy supply.
