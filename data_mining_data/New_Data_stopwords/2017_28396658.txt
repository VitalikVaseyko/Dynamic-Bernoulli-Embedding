 Campylobacter contaminated poultry meat major source human foodborne illness. Campylobacter coli strain OR12 robust colonizer chickens previously shown outcompete displace Campylobacter strains chicken's gastrointestinal tract. strain capable aerobic growth blood agar. Serial aerobic passage increased aerotolerance assessed quantitative assays growth survival solid media. Aerotolerance also associated increased peroxide stress resistance. Aerobic passage alter cellular morphology motility hinder microaerobic growth rate. Colonization broiler chickens aerotolerant C. coli OR12 significantly lower wild-type strain 3 days challenge 7 days, suggesting adaptation occurred. Bacteria recovered chickens retained aerotolerance, indicating trait stable. Whole genome sequencing enabled comparison wild-type sequence. Twenty-three point mutations present, none genes known affect oxidative stress resistance. Insertions deletions caused frame shifts several genes including, phosphoglycerate kinase b subunit pyruvate carboxylase suggest modification central carbohydrate metabolism response aerobic growth. genes affected include encoding putative carbonic anhydrase, motility accessory factor, filamentous haemagglutinin, aminoacyl dipeptidase proteins. Aerotolerance potential affect environmental success survival. Increased environmental survival outside host intestinal tract may allow opportunities transmission hosts. Resistance oxidative stress may equate increased virulence virtue reduced susceptibility oxidative free radicals produced host immune responses. Finally, resistance ambient atmospheric oxygen may allow increased survival chicken skin, therefore constitutes increased risk public health.
