 Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) expressed excessively many different cancer types plays important role control glucose metabolism. Thus, evaluated important target development medication cancer. flavonoids comprise large group natural products variable phenolic structures occur mainly plants. great interest due biological properties. study, effects various flavonoid derivatives PKM2 enzyme activity analyzed vitro. flavonoid derivatives 1 2 showed inhibition effect IC50 values <60 muM. IC50 values compounds 3-8 calculated 134, 415, 145, 163, 295 muM, 3.5 mM, respectively. molecules 9-12 showed activation effect values AC50 less 90 muM. IC50 values derivatives 13-17 calculated 115, 150, 200, 221, 275 muM, respectively. results show catechin derivatives probably used lead compounds design PKM2 enzyme activators inhibitors.
