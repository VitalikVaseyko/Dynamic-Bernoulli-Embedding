 cDNA clones, containing entire coding region rat L-type pyruvate kinase, isolated nucleotide sequences determined dideoxy-chain-termination method. predicted coding region, spans 543 amino acids, established complete amino acid sequence L-type isozyme pyruvate kinase first time. deduced amino acid sequence L type one phosphorylation site amino terminus shows 68% 48% homologies M1-type pyruvate kinase chicken yeast pyruvate kinase respectively. Domain exhibits higher homology domains B C. residues active site L-type enzyme rats, lying domains B A2, rather different M1-type enzyme chickens, residues constituting active site identical chicken M1 type except one amino acid substitution.
