 Fat-storing cells non-parenchymal cells (endothelial Kupffer cells) isolated rat liver combined pronase-collagenase procedure subsequent Visotrast-370 density gradient centrifugation. lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme pattern fat-storing cells found different non-parenchymal liver cells. Fat-storing cells contain LDH-4 main isoenzyme contain LDH-1, whereas non-parenchymal cells five lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, among LDH-5 dominating. non-parenchymal liver cell populations contain M-type pyruvate kinase. alkaline phosphatase fat-storing cells electrophoretic mobility non-parenchymal cells.
