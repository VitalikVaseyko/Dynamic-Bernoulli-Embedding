 Photosynthetic microalgae currently focus basic applied research due ever-growing interest renewable energy resources. review discusses role carbon-unit supply production acetyl-CoA, direct precursor fatty acid biosynthesis primary building block growing acyl chains purpose triacylglycerol (TAG) production photosynthetic microalgae stressful conditions. underscores importance intraplastidic acetyl-CoA generation storage lipid accumulation. main focus placed two enzymatic steps linking central carbon metabolism fatty acid synthesis, namely reactions catalyzed plastidic isoform pyruvate kinase chloroplastic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Alternative routes plastidic acetyl-CoA synthesis also reviewed. separate section devoted recent advances functional genomics studies related fatty acid TAG biosynthesis.
