 AMP converted ATP incubating overnight pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate adenylate kinase presence endogenous ATP (ADP) primer. subsequent incubation presence pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, radioactive glucose hexokinase, ATP ADP estimated together coupling recycling formation glucose 6-phosphate. latter separated precipitation using 76% (v/v) acetone radioactivity measurement Eppendorf tube. sensitivity simple procedures matches exceeds luciferase methods nucleotide determination.
