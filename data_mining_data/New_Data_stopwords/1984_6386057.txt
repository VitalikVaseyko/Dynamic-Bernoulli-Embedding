 Long-term (24-48 h) short-term (10-30 min) regulation hormones hepatic pyruvate kinase activity investigated adult rat hepatocytes cultured serum-free conditions. absence hormones, pyruvate kinase total activity decreased 83%, 67% 39% initial level 24, 48 72 h culture. Insulin (100 nM) maintained total activity significantly control levels throughout period. contrast, glucagon (100 nM) dexamethasone (100 nM) accelerated gradual decrease within 24 h (glucagon) 48 h (dexamethasone) culture. long-term experiments, activity non-saturating concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate decreased glucagon dexamethasone directly modulated insulin. However, insulin increased cellular content pyruvate kinase activator fructose-1,6-diphosphate. short-term experiments cells cultured serum- hormone-free conditions 48 h, glucagon dexamethasone independently caused rapid, dose-dependent increase K0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate within 10 min, Vmax affected. Insulin inhibited action glucagon dexamethasone and, absence, significantly increased substrate affinity phosphoenolpyruvate within 30 min. Cellular fructose-1,6-diphosphate contents remained unchanged conditions. data identify glucocorticoids insulin - addition glucagon - short-term regulators catalytic properties pyruvate kinase. three hormones effective long-term control total enzyme activity.
