 exists linear correlation effect salt rate enzymic reaction effect activation volume (delta V++) reaction. Salts increase delta V++ invariably decrease rate reaction, vice versa. salt effects reaction rate are, however, much larger would predicted solely basis pressure-volume work changes deriving observed alterations delta V++. Different inorganic salts affect reaction rates activation volumes manner reflects salts' positions Hofmeister series. observations, taken conjunction data effects salts protein functional group (aminoacid side-chains peptide linkages) hydration, lead us propose following hypothesis account salt activation inhibition catalysis. Aminoacid side-chains peptide linkages located near protein surface change exposure water conformational events catalysis. protein group transfers accompanied large volume energy changes due largely changes organization water around groups. transfer processes occur rate-limiting step catalysis, energy volume changes contribute free energy activation (delta G++) activation volume reaction. influencing degree water organize around transferred protein groups, salts modify delta G++ (rate) delta V++ reaction.
