 using Fab'-enzyme labelled immunosorbent assay (ELISA) sensitivity picogram (10(-12) g pg) level, M-type pyruvate kinase (M-PyK) plasma determined 47 healthy adults 26 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. upper limits M-PyK normal male female 1.1 1.4 ng/ml. plasma M-PyK HCC patients significantly increased 5 fold average normal level positive rate 95%. 6 cases subclinical small hepatocarcinoma 7 cases HCC normal serum alpha-fetoprotein level, plasma M-PyK increased, whereas plasma M-PyK levels normal acute chronic hepatitis benign diseases. tumor resection, plasma M-PyK returned normal value, increased cases recurrence, suggesting increased M-PyK plasma HCC patients originates M2-type PyK HCC tissue. plasma M2-PyK also increased patients carcinoma digestive tract, M2-PyK may become new marker malignant tumors.
