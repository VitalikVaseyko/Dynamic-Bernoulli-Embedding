 refolding rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase denaturation guanidine hydrochloride studied. dilution denaturing agent, enzyme activity partially regained. extent regain activity dependent protein concentration, showing marked decrease higher concentrations. failure regain complete activity appears related formation inactive aggregates, separated active enzyme gel filtration. Insoluble aggregates partially re-activated solubilization guanidine hydrochloride. Changes circular-dichroism fluorescence spectra refolding suggest partially folded, inactive species formed rapidly; differs native enzyme susceptible proteolysis trypsin.
