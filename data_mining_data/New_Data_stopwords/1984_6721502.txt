 Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, purified rabbit liver, inhibited clofibric acid, phenylpyruvate, dichloroacetate mixed manner relative ATP. I40 values relative 75 microM ATP 0.33, 1.7, 3.0 mM, respectively. Inhibition kinase acetate, pyruvate, lactate minimal; whereas p-hydroxyphenyl substitution compounds increased potency kinase inhibitors, phenyl substitution gave potent inhibitors. Clofibric acid, phenylpyruvate, dichloroacetate activated branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase perfused rat hearts. Perfusate concentrations gave 50% activation (A50) 0.1, 0.32, 0.63 mM, respectively. A50 concentrations clofibric acid phenylpyruvate also increased flux (decarboxylation alpha-keto[1-14C]isovalerate) branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase perfused rat heart. findings suggest that, although clofibric acid phenylpyruvate inhibit substrate utilization branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, major effect compounds branched-chain amino acid metabolism due inhibition branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase subsequent activation increased flux complex.
