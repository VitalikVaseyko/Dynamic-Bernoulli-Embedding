 BACKGROUND: Fecal inflammatory markers shown useful noninvasive screening tools differentiate patients functional organic bowel pathology. markers calprotectin intensively studied. recently, dimeric isoform M2-pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) suggested marker gastrointestinal inflammation. aim study investigate fecal tumor M2-PK differentiation functional organic bowel disease. METHODS: Fecal calprotectin tumor M2-PK measured 94 controls 105 gastroenterology outpatients possible diagnosis organic bowel disease. diagnosis made clinical, endoscopic, radiological criteria. RESULTS: Organic bowel disease diagnosed 14 patients (13%). Median calprotectin tumor M2-PK concentrations 24.5 microg/g 1 U/mL controls, 23 microg/g 1 U/mL functional, 227.5 microg/g 12.6 U/mL organic bowel disease. Sensitivity, specificity, positive negative likelihood ratios diagnosis organic bowel disease 93%, 92%, 11.6, 0.07 calprotectin 67%, 88% 5.6, 0.18 tumor M2-PK, respectively. Calprotectin combination tumor M2-PK gave sensitivity 64%, specificity 98%, likelihood ratios 32 0.03. Elevated calprotectin tumor M2-PK decreased specificity 87%, increased sensitivity 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor M2-PK able differentiate organic functional bowel disease lower sensitivity, specificity, predictive value calprotectin. studies required, alone combination markers, usefulness setting recommended.
