 Mitochondrial cytosolic contents adenine nucleotides phosphate measured perfused rat livers employing technique fractionation freeze-fixated tissue non-aqueous solvents. subcellular contents mitochondrial cytosolic concentrations ATP, ADP, AMP phosphate phosphorylation potentials subcellular ATP systems calculated. attempt made elucidate relationship mitochondrial cytosolic adenine nucleotide systems dependency metabolic state liver. following results obtained: 1. metabolic conditions studied mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios considerably lower cytosolic ratios (mitochondria: 0.1-0.7; cytosol: 2-11). 2. ATP/ADP ratios calculated overall tissue contents reflect mainly cytosolic ratios. 3. inverse relationship found mitochondrial cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios, i.e. mitochondrial ratios tended increase, cytosolic ratios decreased vice versa. 4. phosphorylation potentials calculated subcellular concentrations higher cytosol mitochondria. potential difference varied 11 3 kj/mol livers fed starved rats, respectively. 5. presence mitochondrial inhibitors, i.e. amytal, dinitrophenol carboxyatractyloside, potential difference subcellular ATP systems decreased predominantly due increase mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios. 6. correlation mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios respiratory rates observed, subcellular ratios appeared correlate rate glycolysis. rate lactate + pyruvate production increased, cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios increased, too, whereas mitochondrial ratios tended decrease. 7. adenine nucleotides cytosol appear near equilibrium catalysed adenylate kinase. mitochondria, AMP concentration much lower expected equilibrium conditions. results discussed respect rate control processes involved ATP generation, i.e. oxidative phosphorylation, adenine nucleotide translocation glycolysis.
