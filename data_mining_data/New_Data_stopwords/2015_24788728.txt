 Hypoxia characteristic pathophysiological property locally advanced solid tumors relevant factor tumor (patho-)physiome since promote tumor progression resistance therapy. Tumors alter metabolic pathways survive nutrient oxygen poor microenvironments process known "Warburg Effect." current studies identify novel tumor suppressor gene, termed oxidored nitro domain-containing protein 1 (NOR1) alters hypoxia cellular response nasopharyngeal carcinoma. NOR1 expression causes apoptosis tumor cells hypoxia altering expression PDK1 expression mitochondrial Bax-Bcl2 balance thus suppress tumor cell adaptation hypoxia. Although importance hypoxia cellular response well documented tumor progression, first demonstration human tumor suppressor functions regulating mitochondrial apoptotic pathways suppress tumor survival oxygen poor microenvironments.
