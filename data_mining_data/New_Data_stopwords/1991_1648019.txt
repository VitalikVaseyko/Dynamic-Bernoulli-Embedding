 incubation spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-l-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN), characteristic electron spin resonance (ESR) signal produced greater rate hepatic microsomal fractions malignant hyprthermia susceptible (MHS) pigs compared resistant (MHR) pigs. accompanied increased formation thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Supplementation diets six weeks 235 mg alpha-tocopherol acetate/kg significantly increased microsomal vitamin E content pigs types. Moreover, rate formation TBARS ESR signal height incubated microsomes supplemented MHS pigs decreased MHR pigs. Elevated pyruvate kinase activities TBARS concentrations plasma MHS pigs also moderated dietary vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation may decrease peroxidative events associated MH.
