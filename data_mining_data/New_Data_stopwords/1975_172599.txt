 isolation properties mutant Escherichia coli K12 totally unable take utilize gluconate described. Genetical analysis shows phenotype associated two lesions. One phenotype, designated GntM-, result mutation gene co-transducible malA; other, designated GNTS-, result mutation gene (GntS) co-transducible fdp. GntS--phenotype differs little wild-type cells, GntM- GntS+ organisms grow gluconate prolonged lag form gluconate uptake system strongly repressed pyruvate. Moreover, GntM- mutants readily give rise mutants form gluconate uptake system, gluconate kinase 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase consititutively; partial diploids, constitutivity recessive inducible character. postulated GntM- phenotype due malfunction negative control gene gntR, gntS+ specifies activity gluconate uptake system.
