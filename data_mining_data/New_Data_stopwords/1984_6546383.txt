 Liver L-type pyruvate kinase aldolase B mRNAs two species whose translational activity increases feeding starved rats high carbohydrate diet (Simon, M. P., Besmond, C., Cottreau, D., Weber, A., Chaumet-Riffaud, P., Dreyfus, J. C., Sala Trepat, J., Marie, J., Kahn, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem., press). therefore compared pattern induction three tissues synthesizing enzymes, e.g. liver, small intestine, kidney. Influence high lipid protein diets liver L-type pyruvate kinase aldolase B mRNAs also investigated. starved rat livers, L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA practically undetectable. Carbohydrate diet induced increase mRNA concentrations, maximum 12-18th h; time, mRNA concentration increased 4-8 times aldolase B 40-100 times L-type pyruvate kinase, translational activities representing 1% total mRNA activity enzymes. 24th h carbohydrate diet, mRNA concentrations decreased slightly, remained plateau. animals refed high carbohydrate diet, starvation well high lipid protein diets provoked rapid decrease mRNA concentrations translational activities. kidney, aldolase B mRNA synthesis high starved rats slightly stimulated carbohydrates (1.5-2.5 times). L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA concentration increased 6-15-fold feeding high carbohydrate diet. small intestine, contrast, extent aldolase B mRNA induction carbohydrate diet similar liver, L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA concentration practically similar starved refed rats (about 1:10 concentration observed refed rat liver). results seem indicate mechanisms responsible carbohydrate induction L-type pyruvate kinase aldolase B different. addition, dietary control enzyme also different various tissues synthesize them.
