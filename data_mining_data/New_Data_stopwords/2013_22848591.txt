 Caenorhabditis elegans, slow fat consumption suggested contribute extension survival rate nutritionally adverse conditions. Here, investigated potential role pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK)-2, C. elegans homolog mammalian PDK, effects fat metabolism nutritional conditions. PDHK-2 expressed low levels well-fed conditions highly induced long-term starvation dauer state. increase pdhk-2 expression regulated DAF-16 NHR-49. Dauer-specific induction PDHK-2 abolished upon entry post-dauer stage. Interestingly, long-term dauer state, stored fat levels higher daf-2(e1370);pdhk-2 double mutants daf-2(e1370), suggesting positive relationship PDHK-2 activity fat consumption. PDHK-2 deficiency shown lead greater preservation residual fats, would predicted contribute survival dauer state. test prediction showed survival rates daf-2(e1370);pdhk-2(tm3075) daf-2(e1370);pdhk-2(tm3086) double mutants higher daf-2(e1370), suggesting loss either ATP-binding domain (tm3075) branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase kinase domain (tm3086) PDHK-2 leads reduced fat consumption thus favors increased dauer survival. attenuated fat consumption long-term dauer state C. elegans daf-2 (e1370);pdhk-2 mutants associated concomitant down-regulation lipases ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase), HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase), C07E3.9 (phospholipase). contrast, PDHK-2 overexpression wild-type starved worms induced lipase expression promoted abnormal dauer formation. Thus, propose PDHK-2 serves molecular bridge, connecting fat metabolism survival nutritionally adverse conditions C. elegans.
