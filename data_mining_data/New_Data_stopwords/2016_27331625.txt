 BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBM) present high cellular heterogeneity conspicuous necrotic regions associated hypoxia, related tumor aggressiveness. GBM tumors exhibit high glycolytic metabolism increased lactate production extruded tumor microenvironment monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). hypoxia-mediated regulation MCT4 characterized, role MCT1 still controversial. Thus, aimed understand role hypoxia regulation MCT expression function GBM, MCT1 particular. METHODS: Expression hypoxia- glycolytic-related markers, well MCT1 MCT4 isoforms assessed vitro vivo orthotopic glioma models, also human GBM tissues immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry Western blot. Following MCT1 inhibition, either pharmacologically CHC (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxynnamic acid) genetically siRNAs, assessed GBM cell viability, proliferation, metabolism, migration invasion, normoxia hypoxia conditions. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced increase MCT1 plasma membrane expression glioma cells, vitro vivo models. Additionally, treatment CHC downregulation MCT1 glioma cells decreased lactate production, cell proliferation invasion hypoxia. Moreover, vivo orthotopic model human GBM tissues, extensive co-expression MCT1, MCT4, GBM hypoxia marker CAIX. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia-induced MCT1 supports GBM glycolytic phenotype, responsible lactate efflux important mediator cell survival aggressiveness. Therefore, MCT1 constitutes promising therapeutic target GBM.
