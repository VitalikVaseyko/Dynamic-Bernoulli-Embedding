 applied digital gene expression profiling determine transcriptome brown white adipose tissues (BAT WAT, respectively) cold exposure. Male C57BL/6J mice exposed cold 2 4 days. notable induction genes related glucose uptake, glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway observed BAT cold-exposed animals. addition, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 expression induced BAT cold-challenged mice, suggesting increased synthesis glycerol glucose. Similarly, expression lactate dehydrogenases induced cold BAT. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (Pdk2) Pdk4 expressed significantly higher levels BAT WAT, Pdk2 induced BAT cold. notice, subset changes detected BAT observed WAT. Based changes gene expression cold exposure, propose model intermediary glucose metabolism activated BAT: 1) fluxes glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway induced, latter providing reducing equivalents de novo fatty acid synthesis; 2) glycerol synthesis glucose increased, facilitating triacylglycerol synthesis/fatty acid re-esterification; 3) glycogen turnover lactate production increased; 4) entry glucose carbon tricarboxylic acid cycle restricted PDK2 PDK4. summary, results demonstrate extensive diverse gene expression changes related glucose handling activated BAT.
