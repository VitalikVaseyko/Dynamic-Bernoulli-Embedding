 MAIN CONCLUSION: metabolic shift green hairy root cultures carrot phenylpropanoid/benzenoid biosynthesis toward volatile isoprenoids observed compared metabolite profile normal hairy root cultures. Hairy roots cultures Daucus carota turned green continuous illumination, content major phenolic compound p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA) reduced half compared normal hairy roots cultured darkness. p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (HBD) activity suppressed green hairy roots. However, comparative volatile analysis 14-day-old green hairy roots revealed higher monoterpene sesquiterpene contents found normal hairy roots. Methyl salicylate content higher normal hairy roots green ones. Application clomazone, inhibitor 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), reduced amount total monoterpenes sesquiterpenes green hairy roots compared normal hairy roots. However, methyl salicylate content enhanced green normal hairy roots treated clomazone compared respective controls. methyl-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) phenylpropanoid pathways, respectively, contribute formation monoterpenes phenolic acids biosynthesis, activities enzymes regulating pathways measured terms vitro activities, green normal hairy root cultures. key enzymes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), early regulatory enzyme MEP pathway, pyruvate kinase (PK), enzyme primary metabolism related MEP pathway, shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH) involved biosynthesis aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes first step phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Activities DXR PK higher green hairy roots compared normal ones, whereas opposite trend observed SKDH PAL activities. Gene expression analysis DXR PAL showed trends similar respective enzyme activities. Based observations, suggest possible redirection metabolites primary metabolism toward isoprenoid biosynthesis, limiting phenolic biosynthetic pathway green hairy roots grown continuous light.
