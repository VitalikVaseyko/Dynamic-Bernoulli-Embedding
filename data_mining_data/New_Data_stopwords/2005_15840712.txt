 Weinberg coworkers used serial transduction human, primary fibroblast cell line catalytic domain human telomerase, large antigen, small antigen, oncogenic allele H-ras study stages leading toward fully transformed cancerous state. performed three-dimensional screening experiment using 4 cell lines, 5 small-molecule perturbagens (2-deoxyglucose, oxamate, oligomycin, rapamycin, wortmannin), large number metabolic measurements. Hierarchical clustering performed obtain signatures 4 cell lines, 24 cell states, 5 perturbagens, number metabolic parameters. Analysis signatures sensitivities cell lines perturbagens provided insights bioenergetic states progressively transformed cell lines, effect oncogenes small-molecule sensitivity, global physiological responses modulators aerobic anaerobic metabolism. gained insight relationship two models carcinogenesis, one (the Warburg hypothesis) based increased energy production glycolysis cancer cells response aberrant respiration, one based cancer-causing genes. Rather opposing models, approach described suggests two models interlinked. cancer-causing genes used study appear increase progressively cell's dependence glycolytic energy production decrease dependence mitochondrial energy production. However, mitochondrial biogenesis appears complex dependence, increasing greatest extent intermediate degree transduction rather fully transformed state.
