 Land snails species occur range habitats humid semi-arid arid ones seasonal variations physiology biochemical composition linked annual cycles photoperiod, temperature, humidity water availability. effort understand thermal tolerance impact temperature elevation tissue metabolism land snails determined mortality, heamolymph PO2 activities enzymes intermediary metabolism three land snail species (Helix lucorum, Helix pomatia Cornu aspersum) differing geographical distribution inhabiting areas different climatic characteristics. mortality observed population Cornu aspersum, Helix pomatia exhibited higher mortality Helix lucorum. PO2 dropped within first 10days exposure elevated temperature species, although Cornu aspersum decrease significantly lower. significant reduction enzymatic activities glycolytic enzymes studied, well citrate synthase (CS) 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) observed thermal tolerant species C. aspersum populations studied. Significant reductions enzymatic activity glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) d-Lactate dehydrogenase (d-LDH) observed Helix lucorum Helix pomatia. observed inter-specific differences seem accordance life cycle characteristics species may attributed climatic differences among habitats within distribution range.
