 BACKGROUND: recurrence rate chordoma high, prognosis poor. METHODS: Differential proteomic analysis performed chordomas adjacent normal tissues, verification Western blot. Protein expression evaluated immunohistochemistry 37 chordomas. Association candidate protein expression clinical parameters, disease-free survival, overall survival analyzed. RESULTS: identified 14 up-regulated 5 down-regulated proteins chordomas. Expression alpha enolase (ENO1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), gp96 higher recurrences primary tumors. Univariate analysis showed significantly adverse factors disease-free survival overexpression ENO1 PKM2, involvement contiguous vertebral levels, inadequate surgical margin initial surgery. Inadequate surgical margin without radiotherapy, involvement contiguous vertebral levels, cervical spine location adverse factors overall survival. multivariate analysis, independent adverse prognostic factors inadequate surgical margin involvement multiple contiguous vertebral levels recurrence; upper cervical spine location involvement contiguous vertebral levels tumor-related death. Multivariate analysis failed show significance proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Involvements multiple contiguous vertebral levels upper cervical spine, rather overexpression ENO1, PKM2, gp96, independent prognostic indicators chordomas.
