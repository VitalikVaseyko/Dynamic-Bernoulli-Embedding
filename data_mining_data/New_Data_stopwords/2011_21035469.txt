 RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, RPS6KB1, RPS6KB2, PDK1 involved several pathways central carcinogenic process, including regulation cell growth, insulin, inflammation. evaluated genetic variation candidate genes obtain better understanding association colon rectal cancer. used data two population-based case-control studies colon (n=1574 cases, 1940 controls) rectal (n=791 cases, 999 controls) cancer. observed genetic variation RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2, PRS6KB2 associated risk developing colon cancer genetic variation RPS6KA2 associated altering risk rectal cancer. genes also interacted significantly genes operating similar mechanisms, including Akt1, FRAP1, NFkappaB1, PIK3CA. Assessment tumor markers indicated genes pathway may importantly contributed CIMP+ tumors tumors KRAS2 mutations. findings implicate candidate genes etiology colon rectal cancer provide information genes operate genes pathway. data suggest pathway may lead CIMP+ KRAS2-mutated tumors.
