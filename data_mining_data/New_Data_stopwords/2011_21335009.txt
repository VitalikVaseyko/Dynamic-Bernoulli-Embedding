 Many life history stages animals experience environmental insults enter developmental arrested states characterized reduced cellular proliferation, without concurrent reduction overall metabolism. case profound metabolic arrest reported invertebrates, i.e., anaerobic quiescence Artemia franciscana embryos, acidification intracellular milieu major factor governing catabolic anabolic downregulation. Release ions intracellular compartments source approximately 50% proton equivalents needed 1.5 unit acidification observed. Recovery metabolic arrest requires re-sequestration protons vacuolar-type ATPase (V-ATPase). remarkable facet mechanism ability embryonic cells survive dissipation intracellular ion gradients. Across many diapause-like states, metabolic reduction subsequent matching energy demand accomplished shifting energy metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis. Molecular pathways activated induce resilient hypometabolic states include stimulation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) insulin signaling via suite daf (dauer formation) genes diapause-like states nematodes insects. Contributing factors metabolically depressed states involve hypoxia-inducible factor-1 downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Metabolic similarities natural states stasis cancer phenotypes noteworthy. Reduction flux oxidative phosphorylation helps prevent cell death certain cancer types, similar way increases viability dauer stages Caenorhabditis elegans. Mechanisms underlie natural stasis used pre-condition mammalian cells prior cell biostabilization storage.
