 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) one common lethal tumors world, development new therapeutic targets needed. Recent studies shown aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, mediated anti-apoptotic effects cancer cells. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) executed final step aerobic lactate production reported involved tumor progression. However, function LDHA ESCC investigated. study, found LDHA up-regulated ESCC clinical samples. Knockdown expression LDHA inhibited cell growth cell migration vitro well tumorigenesis vivo. regard molecular mechanism, silencing expression LDHA related decreased AKT activation cyclin D1 expression increased cleavage PARP caspase 8. Taken together, findings suggest LDHA plays important role progression ESCC modulating cell growth, LDHA might potential therapeutic target ESCC.
