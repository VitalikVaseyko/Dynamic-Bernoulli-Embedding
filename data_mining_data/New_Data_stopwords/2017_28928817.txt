 Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, promotes flux carbohydrates mitochondria enhances aerobic oxidation glucose. DCA previously demonstrated exhibit antitumor properties. present study revealed treatment DCA induced increased levels autophagy-associated proteins esophageal squamous carcinoma cells minimally affecting apoptosis. present study examined localization light chain (LC)-3 adenovirus infection green fluorescent protein (FP)-red FP-LC3 reporter construction confirmed DCA treatment induced significant autophagy. Furthermore, inhibition DCA-induced autophagy facilitated cell apoptosis improved drug sensitivity esophageal squamous carcinoma cells DCA 5-FU (5-fluorouracil). proliferation TE-1 cells markedly inhibited low concentrations DCA 5-FU treatment subjected Atg5 mRNA interference, indicating autophagy performed protective role cell survival upon DCA treatment. determine underlying mechanism DCA-induced autophagy, present study measured alterations autophagy-associated signaling pathways. Notably, protein kinase B (Akt)-mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, important negative regulator autophagy, demonstrated suppressed DCA treatment. results may direct development novel strategies treatment esophageal squamous carcinoma based combined use DCA autophagy inhibitors.
