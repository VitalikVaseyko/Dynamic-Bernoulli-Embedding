 (1) Liver cells starved rats incubated 10 mM L-lactate, 1 mM pyruvate 0.3 microM glucagon presence absence mild respiratory inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) 0.5 mM. (2) whole cell concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate 3-phosphoglycerate increased 2-fold, whilst triose hexose phosphate concentrations decreased significantly. Similar results obtained 0.15 microM oligomycin 10 microM atractyloside. (3) data explained substantial decrease cytosolic free concentration ratio ATP/ADP acting equilibrium glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase phosphoglycerate kinase. (4) increase cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate concentration account observed increase pyruvate kinase flux occurs conditions (Pryor et al. (1987) Biochem. J. 247, 449-457). (5) inhibition pyruvate carboxylase also implied decrease calculated tissue oxaloacetate concentrations, confirming role enzymes inhibition gluconeogenesis. (6) Whole cell concentrations effectors pyruvate carboxylase activity measured; ATP/ADP ratio decreased significantly. (7) Subcellular fractionation studies showed good correlation measured mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio rates gluconeogenesis presence absence oleate. (8) similar correlation could observed rates pyruvate carboxylation measured matrix ATP/ADP ratio isolated liver mitochondria starved rats. (9) Data also presented suggesting additional effect DCMU rate pyruvate carboxylation situ circumstances, mediated decreases mitochondrial acetyl-CoA cytosolic pyruvate concentrations. (10) noted effects phenylethylbiguanide (phenformin) rate gluconeogenesis metabolite profiles perfused liver (Cooke et al. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5272-5277) similar caused DCMU, supporting mitochondrial locus action hypoglycaemic agent.
