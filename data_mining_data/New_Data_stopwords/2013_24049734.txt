 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma coactivators (PGC-1alpha PGC-1beta) play important roles transcriptional regulation intermediary metabolism. evaluate effects overexpressing PGC-1alpha PGC-1beta physiologic levels liver, generated transgenic mice inducible overexpression PGC-1alpha PGC-1beta. Gene expression array profiling revealed whereas PGC-1 family proteins induced mitochondrial oxidative enzymes, expression several genes involved converting glucose fatty acid induced PGC-1beta, PGC-1alpha. increased expression enzymes involved carbohydrate utilization de novo lipogenesis PGC-1beta required carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). interaction PGC-1beta ChREBP, well PGC-1beta occupancy liver-type pyruvate kinase promoter, influenced glucose concentration liver-specific PGC-1beta(-/-) hepatocytes refractory lipogenic response high glucose conditions. data suggest PGC-1beta-mediated coactivation ChREBP involved lipogenic response hyperglycemia.
