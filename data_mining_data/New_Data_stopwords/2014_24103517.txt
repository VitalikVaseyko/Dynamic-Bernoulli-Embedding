 OBJECTIVE: Protective effects trigonelline (TRG) isolated fenugreek seed evaluated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial dysfunctions adult rats proteomic approach applied understand mechanism action. METHODS: preliminary experiment, effects TRG 20, 40, 80 mg/kg 20 studied ISO-induced (100 mg/kg) adult rats. 40 mg/kg found effective concentration, final experiment, effects 40 mg/kg test drug investigated using different indices including cardiac marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, cardiac histology, electrocardiogram. Proteomic analyses also done cardiac myocytes. RESULTS: ISO administration increased serum levels cardiac markers (creatine kinase-MB, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase) exhibited positive reaction TROP-T test. also increased cardiac lipid peroxidation decreased cellular antioxidants. Proteomic data revealed nine protein spots, seven down-regulated two up-regulated. overexpressions two small stress proteins, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 alphaB crystallin confirmed Western blot analysis. alterations restored nearly normal values 40 mg/kg TRG-pretreated animals, suggesting cardioprotective effects, confirmed histologic examinations triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining assay. CONCLUSION: first time, study revealed down-regulation Hsp27 alphaB-crystallin (CaMKII delta) isoform TRG. test compound prevented ISO-induced myocardial injury, therapeutic use may explored.
