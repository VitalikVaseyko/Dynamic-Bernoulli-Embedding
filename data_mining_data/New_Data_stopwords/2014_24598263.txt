 inhibition triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) glycolysis pyruvate kinase (PK) substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) results newly discovered feedback loop counters oxidative stress cancer actively respiring cells. mechanism underlying inhibition illuminated co-crystal structure TPI bound PEP 1.6 resolution, mutational studies guided crystallographic results. PEP bound catalytic pocket TPI occludes substrate, accounts observation PEP competitively inhibits interconversion glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Replacing isoleucine residue located catalytic pocket TPI valine threonine altered binding substrates PEP, reducing TPI activity vitro vivo. Confirming TPI-mediated activation pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), transgenic yeast cells expressing TPI mutations accumulate greater levels PPP intermediates altered stress resistance, mimicking activation PK-TPI feedback loop. results support model glycolytic regulation requires direct catalytic inhibition TPI pyruvate kinase substrate PEP, mediating protective metabolic self-reconfiguration central metabolism conditions oxidative stress.
