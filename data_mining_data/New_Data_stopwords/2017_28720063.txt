 STYK1 (Serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1), member receptor tyrosine kinase family, exhibits tumorigenicity many types cancers. study reveals important role played STYK1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. STYK1 upregulated nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues compared para-carcinoma. Knockdown STYK1 inhibits nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, ectopic STYK1 expression significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion abilities. addition, provided lines evidence supporting critical role STYK1 regulation glycolysis via activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Survival analysis reveals STYK1 level independent prognostic factor nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. results indicate STYK1 promising therapeutic target nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
