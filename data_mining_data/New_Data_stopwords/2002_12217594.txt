 BACKGROUND/AIMS: High-fat (HF) diets cause glucose intolerance. Fibrates improve glucose tolerance. tried obtain information possible hepatic mechanisms contributing effect. METHODS: Rats fed HF diet, isocaloric control diet, 3 weeks without clofibrate. Several parameters related liver glucose glycogen metabolism measured. RESULTS: Clofibrate prevented induction glucose intolerance 3 weeks HF feeding. Improved glucose tolerance clofibrate due increases glucose phosphorylation glycolysis liver, since HF diet clofibrate suppressed glucokinase pyruvate kinase activities effect glucose 6-phosphatase. Clofibrate decreased glycogen storage control HF rats. Clofibrate, without HF feeding, inhibited weight gain experimental period. Body temperature significantly elevated clofibrate, indicative increased basal metabolic rate. capacity liver mitochondria oxidize long-chain fatty acids increased clofibrate treatment. Mitochondria show uncoupling. CONCLUSIONS: Clofibrate improve glucose tolerance improving hepatic glucose glycogen metabolism. Peripheral glucose oxidation may facilitated increased energy dissipation.
