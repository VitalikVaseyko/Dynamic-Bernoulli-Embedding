 Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) generated pyruvate required de novo synthesis glycerol glycogen skeletal muscle. One possible pathway involves synthesis PEP citric acid cycle intermediates via PEP carboxykinase, whereas another could involve reversal pyruvate kinase (PK). Earlier studies reported reverse flux PK contribute carbon precursors glycogen synthesis muscle, physiological importance pathway remains uncertain especially setting high plasma glucose. addition, although PEP common intermediate glyconeogenesis glyceroneogenesis, importance reverse PK de novo glycerol synthesis examined. studied contribution reverse PK synthesis glycogen glycerol moiety acylglycerols skeletal muscle animals high plasma glucose. Rats received single intraperitoneal bolus glucose, glycerol, lactate fed fasted state. one three substrates (13)C-labeled experiment. 3 h normal awake activity, animals sacrificed, contribution substrate glycogen glycerol moiety acylglycerols evaluated. fraction (13)C labeling glycogen glycerol moiety exceeded possible contribution either plasma glucose muscle oxaloacetate. reverse PK served common route glyconeogenesis glyceroneogenesis skeletal muscle rats high plasma glucose. activity pyruvate carboxylase low muscle, PEP carboxykinase activity detected.
