 Antiangiogenic therapies pursued means starving tumors energy supply. Although numerous studies show therapies render tumors hypoxic, many studies have, surprisingly, shown improved tumor oxygenation. contradicting findings challenge original rationale antiangiogenic therapy understanding physiology tissue oxygenation. flow-diffusion equation, describes relation blood flow extraction freely diffusible molecules tissue, recently extended take heterogeneity capillary transit times (CTH) account. CTH likely high chaotic microvasculature tumor, increasing effective shunting blood capillary bed. review properties extended flow-diffusion equation tumor tissue. Elevated CTH reduces extraction oxygen, glucose, cytotoxic molecules. extent net extraction improved antiangiogenic therapy, turn, depends extent CTH normalized treatment. extraction oxygen glucose affected different extents elevated CTH, degree aerobic glycolysis-known Warburg effect-is thus predicted represent adaptation CTH local microvasculature.
