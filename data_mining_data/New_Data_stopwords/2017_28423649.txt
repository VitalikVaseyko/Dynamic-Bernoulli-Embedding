 Novel agents still urgently expected therapy chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). vitro anti-leukemia activity Stellettin B (Stel B), triterpenoid isolated marine sponge Jaspis stellifera, human CML K562 KU812 cells recently investigated. Stel B inhibited K562 KU812 cell proliferation IC50 0.035 muM 0.95 muM respectively. obvious cell cycle arrest observed, apoptosis induced K562 cells Stel B treatment. Stel B-induced apoptosis might mitochondrial pathway, increase Bad Bax, decrease Bcl-2 activation caspase-9. addition, dose-dependent increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) loss mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) occurred. Meanwhile, Stel B inhibited phosphorylation Stat5, expression 4 PI3K catalytic isoforms, phosphorylation downstream effectors including PDK1 Akt, suggesting inhibition Stat5 PI3K might involved apoptosis-inducing effect. Combination Stel B Imatinib ratio IC50 Stel B : 5xIC50 Imatinib led synergistic effect. Stel B might become promising candidate CML therapy alone together Imatinib.
