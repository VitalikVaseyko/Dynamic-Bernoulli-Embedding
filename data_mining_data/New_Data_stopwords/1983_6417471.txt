 Lithium ion, like insulin, activated adipocyte glycogen synthase without glucose medium. However, effect lithium ion much greater insulin conditions. lithium-activated glycogen synthase stable Sephadex chromatography ethanol precipitation enzyme, indicating effect lithium ion glycogen synthase covalent modification enzyme. Glycogen synthase significantly activated lithium ion conditions concentrations cellular ATP unaffected. effect lithium ion glycogen synthase rapid observed concentrations low 1 3 mM, reaching maximum concentration 40 mM. thus sensitive effects studied (see previous paper). Insulin stimulated glycogen synthase low concentrations maximal concentration lithium ion. Lithium-activated glycogen synthase inhibited epinephrine dibutyryl cyclic AMP, affected removal extracellular Ca++. Interestingly, lithium ion detectable effect basal pyruvate dehydrogenase well epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylase. failure lithium ion thus mimic insulin actions pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylase suggests action lithium ion glycogen synthase quite specific may mediated stimulating phosphatase inhibiting protein kinase acting specifically glycogen synthase.
