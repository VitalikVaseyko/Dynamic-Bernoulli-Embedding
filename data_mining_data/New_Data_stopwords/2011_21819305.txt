 Many cancer cells utilize aerobic glycolysis (also known 'Warburg effect'), instead mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, generate energy necessary diverse cellular processes. tumor cells, mitochondria play important roles anabolism, instance, de novo lipid biosynthesis glutamine-dependent anaplerosis fuel robust cell growth proliferation. Proteomic analysis tumor-related alterations metabolism-associated proteins clearly indicates metabolic reprogramming contributes cancer cell survival cancer progression. Moreover, proteomics-based systems biology provides powerful tool re-evaluate metabolic phenotype regulatory mechanism associated malignant cancer cells, underscores implications cancer diagnosis therapy. article address recent exciting advances understanding cancer cell metabolism using proteomics-based systems biology approaches.
