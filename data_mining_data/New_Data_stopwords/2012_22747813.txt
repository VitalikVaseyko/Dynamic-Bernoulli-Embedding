 effect temperature sperm motility investigated brown trout Salmo trutta, burbot Lota lota grayling Thymallus thymallus using water sperm motility prolonging saline solution (SMPS) motility activation. effect temperature (4-20 degrees C) spermatozoal enzymes energy supply [malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), adenylate kinase (AK)], flagellar movement [Mg(2+) adenosine triposphatase (ATPase)] oxidative defence [peroxidase (POX)] measured S. trutta L. lota. Temperatures yielding highest initial sperm motility rates swimming velocities 4-6 degrees C S. trutta [investigated range (IR) = 4-12 degrees C] L. lota (IR = 2-8 degrees C) 8-16 degrees C (IR = 4-16 degrees C) T. thymallus. Motility variables re-measured 30 S. trutta, 45 T. thymallus 60 L. lota water 2 min investigated species SMPS. Motility variables increased low temperatures results differed water SMPS.
