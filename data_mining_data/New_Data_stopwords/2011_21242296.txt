 Proliferating embryonic cancer cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis support growth, metabolic alteration commonly referred "Warburg effect." Here, show glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) crucial Warburg effect human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), common malignant brain tumor. contrast normal brain low-grade gliomas, express predominantly HK1, GBMs show increased HK2 expression. HK2 expression correlates worse overall survival GBM patients. Depletion HK2, neither HK1 pyruvate kinase M2, GBM cells restored oxidative glucose metabolism increased sensitivity cell death inducers radiation temozolomide. Intracranial xenografts HK2-depleted GBM cells showed decreased proliferation angiogenesis, increased invasion, well diminished expression hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha vascular endothelial growth factor. contrast, exogenous HK2 expression GBM cells led increased proliferation, therapeutic resistance, intracranial growth. Growth dependent glucose phosphorylation mitochondrial translocation mediated AKT signaling, often aberrantly activated GBMs. Collectively, findings suggest therapeutic strategies modulate Warburg effect, targeting HK2, may interfere growth therapeutic sensitivity GBMs.
