 Taking advantage recent identification polypeptides carbon metabolism machinery yeast protein map [1], applied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis study changes protein composition Saccharomyces cerevisiae depending fermentable nonfermentable nature carbon source. levels 250 abundant polypeptides compared. Thirty-three found display markedly increased levels growth nonfermentable carbon sources. 33 polypeptides include 11 mitochondrial polypeptides polypeptides corresponding alcohol dehydrogenase II, acetyl-CoA synthetase, phosphoenol pyruvate kinase hexokinase PI. Sixteen polypeptides, contrast, reached higher levels growth fermentable carbon sources. Among identified monomeric subunits 6 glycolytic enzymes. Collectively 33 polypeptides first class comprised 30% total soluble proteins cells grown nonfermentable carbon source 3% growth fermentable carbon source. protein fraction 16 polypeptides second class corresponded 10% 38%, respectively. Together results show two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, coupled identification polypeptides carbon metabolism apparatus, provides valuable tool approaching questions concerning carbon metabolism S. cerevisiae.
