 Seventeen distances two paramagnetic reference points, determined nuclear relaxation studies six active complexes rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, used construct molecular models two composite enzyme complexes. model hypothetical pyruvate kinase-M(I)-M(II)-ATP-Cr(III)-P-enolpyruvate complex, overlap transferred phosphoryl groups two substrates, required explain observed competition, incomplete, allowing greater equal 1 transition state form. active enzyme-M(I)-M(II)-ATP-Cr(III)-pyruvate complex, gamma-phosphoryl phosphorus ATP molecular contact (3.0 +/- 0.5 A) carbonyl oxygen pyruvate, consistent direct phosphoryl transfer, indicating need intermediate phosphorylation enzyme. enzyme-bound divalent cation, forms second sphere complexes phosphoryl groups P-enolpyruvate ATP, may activate transferred phosphoryl group indirectly, water ligand. analogy position Cr(III), second divalent cation may participate directly coordination triphosphate chain ATP.
