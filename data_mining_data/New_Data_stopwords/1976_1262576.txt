 Rates patterns metabolism specifically labeled glucose, pyruvate, acetate mammary slices indicated rates glucose metabolism Embden-Meyerhof pentose phosphate pathways relative pentose cycle activity decreased adrenalectomy. Fatty acid synthesis acetate impaired. Capacity provide reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate fatty acid synthesis limiting factor responsible decreased fatty acid synthesis glucose adrenalectomized, lactating rat mammary glands. Oxidation [1-carbon-14]pyruvate fatty acid synthesis [2-carbon-14] pyruvate affected adrenalectomy. Indirect reasoning based upon data reported led suggestion decreased fatty acid synthesis glucose adrenalectomy may resulted decreased formation triose phosphate via phosphofructose-kinase reaction. suggested decreases rat mammary enzyme adrenalectomy direct (causative) relationship depressed lactational performance adrenalectomy. Restriction food intake caused decreased fatty acid synthesis glucose, pyruvate, acetate, relative fatty acid esterification activity higher control adrenalectomized animals. effects adrenalectomy mammary gland metabolism dissociated partially reduced food intake.
