 glucose primary substrate oxidative metabolism adult brain, measurements glucose utilization provide information cerebral energy metabolism, ultimately linked neuronal activity. Early studies utilized vitro techniques measure carbohydrate oxidation well glycolytic citric acid cycle enzymatic activities function age. Although results studies somewhat equivocal, generally indicate decline cerebral carbohydrate metabolism senescent rodents. recently, local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) measured awake, resting rats 2-deoxy-D[1-14C]glucose metabolic mapping technique. Using technique, decrements LCGU observed rats midlife. Co-dergocrine, ergot alkaloid used extensively geriatric psychopharmacology, reversed subcortical LCGU decrements brain areas associated motor function, motivation, learning. contrast, drug decreased frontal cortical LCGU middle-aged rats. Stimulatory effects co-dergocrine LCGU brain areas associated motivation learning support view drug may useful age-associated disorders cognition. Furthermore, co-dergocrine-induced decrease cortical glucose utilization coupled drug's cerebral vasoconstrictive action may render cortical cells less susceptible sequelae ischemia.
