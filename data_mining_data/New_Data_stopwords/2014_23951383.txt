 BACKGROUND: investigated pathological diagnostic role selected markers inflammation, oxidant/antioxidant status, cellular injury human Chagas disease. METHODS: Seropositive/chagasic subjects characterized clinically-symptomatic clinically-asymptomatic (n = 116), seronegative/cardiac subjects (n = 102), seronegative/healthy subjects (n = 45) analyzed peripheral blood biomarkers. RESULTS: Seropositive/chagasic subjects exhibited increase sera plasma levels myeloperoxidase (MPO, 2.8-fold), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP, 56%), nitrite (5.7-fold), lipid peroxides (LPO, 12-17-fold) malondialdehyde (MDA, 4-6-fold); decline superoxide dismutase (SOD, 52%) glutathione (GSH, 75%) contents. Correlation analysis identified significant (p<0.001) linear relationship inflammatory markers (AOPP/nitrite: r = 0.877), inflammation antioxidant/oxidant status (AOPP/glutathione peroxidase (GPX): r = 0.902, AOPP/GSH: r = 0.806, Nitrite/GPX: 0.773, Nitrite/LPO: 0.805, MDA/MPO: 0.718), antioxidant/oxidant levels (GPX/MDA: r = 0.768) chagasic subjects. these, MPO, LPO nitrite biomarkers highly specific sensitive distinguishing seropositive/chagasic subjects seronegative/healthy controls (p<0.001, training fitting AUC/ROC >0.95). MPO (r = 0.664) LPO (r = 0.841) levels also correlated clinical disease state chagasic subjects (p<0.001). Seronegative/cardiac subjects exhibited 77% decline SOD, 3-5-fold increase LPO glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) levels, statistically insignificant change MPO, AOPP, MDA, GPX, GSH, creatine kinase (CK) levels. CONCLUSIONS: interlinked effects innate immune responses antioxidant/oxidant imbalance major determinants human Chagas disease. MPO, LPO nitrite excellent biomarkers diagnosing seropositive/chagasic subjects, MPO LPO levels potential utility identifying clinical severity Chagas disease.
