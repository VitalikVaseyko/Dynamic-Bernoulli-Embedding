 basis experimental data obtained vitro, propose differential segregation actin tubulin cytoplasm may regulatory mechanism metabolic fluxes. results presented point enzymes may differentially modulated different locations cytoplasm, depending cytoskeletal protein present location, concentration, polymeric status, geometric arrangement. Essentially, actin microtubular protein would exert effect enzymatic catalysis displacement equilibrium enzyme oligomers either active less active species. latter corroborated mathematical modeling dynamic coupling microtubular protein assembly-disassembly pyruvate kinase activity. results, precise biochemical meaning given putative linkage existing mechanisms cells rearrange cytoplasmic architecture dynamics biochemical reactions taking place concomitantly.
