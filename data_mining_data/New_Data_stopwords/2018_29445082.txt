 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) glycolytic enzyme expressed cancer cells. role tumor metabolism definitively established, investigators suggested regulation PKM2 activity cause accumulation glycolytic intermediates increase flux pentose phosphate pathway. Recent evidence suggests PKM2 also may non-metabolic functions, including transcriptional co-activator gene regulation. reported previously PKM2 abundant photoreceptor cells mouse retinas. present study, conditionally deleted PKM2 (rod-cre PKM2-KO) rod photoreceptors found absence PKM2 causes increased expression PKM1 rods. Analysis metabolic flux U-(13)C glucose shows rod-cre PKM2-KO retinas accumulate glycolytic intermediates, consistent overall reduction amount pyruvate kinase activity. Rod-cre PKM2-KO mice also increased NADPH availability could favor lipid synthesis, found difference phospholipid synthesis rod-cre PKM2 KO PKM2-positive controls. rod-cre PKM2-KO mice aged, observed significant loss rod function, reduced thickness photoreceptor outer segment layer, reduced expression photoreceptor proteins, including PDE6beta. rod-cre PKM2-KO retinas showed greater TUNEL staining wild-type retinas, indicating slow retinal degeneration. vitro analysis showed PKM2 regulate transcriptional activity PDE6beta promoter vitro. findings indicate metabolic transcriptional regulatory functions PKM2 may contribute photoreceptor structure, function, viability.
