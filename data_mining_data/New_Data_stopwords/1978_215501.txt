 first 72 h 67% partial hepatectomy female Wistar rats (160 g) specific activities [mumol X min-1 X (g liver)-1] glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-bisphosphatase glycolytic hexokinase 6-phosphofructokinase remained essentially constant. However, activity glycolytic pyruvate kinase (L- plus M2-type) decreased slightly glucokinase decreased markedly 30%, glucogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase increased 200%. 10 40 h partial hepatectomy, proliferation started periportal area, shift glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase-rich zone normal periportal intermediate even perivenous position observed histochemically. 48 h, proliferation longer restricted periportal zone, normal glucose-6-phosphatase zonation (as partial hepatectomy) restored. Glycogen degraded rapidly first 4 h operation; later repeatedly resynthesized degraded correlation feeding rhythm animals. zonation glycogen metabolism accord observed zonation glucose-6-phosphatase.
