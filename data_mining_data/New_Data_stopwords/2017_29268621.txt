 SIGNIFICANCE: Optical imaging using endogenous fluorescence metabolic cofactors enabled nondestructive examination dynamic changes cell tissue function vitro vivo. Quantifying NAD(P)H FAD fluorescence optical redox ratio fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) provides sensitivity relative balance oxidative phosphorylation glucose catabolism. Since introduction decades ago, use NAD(P)H imaging expanded include applications involving almost every major tissue type variety pathologies. Recent Advances: review focuses use two-photon excited fluorescence NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime techniques cancer, neuroscience, tissue engineering, biomedical applications last 5 years. variety cancer models, NAD(P)H fluorescence intensity lifetime measurements demonstrate sensitivity Warburg effect, suggesting potential early detection high-throughput drug screening. sensitivity biosynthetic demands stem cell differentiation tissue repair processes indicates range applications imaging technology may broad. CRITICAL ISSUES: number applications fluorescence imaging techniques expand, identifying characterizing additional intrinsic fluorophores chromophores present vivo vital accurately measure interpret metabolic outcomes. Understanding full capabilities limitations FLIM also key future advances. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Future work needed evaluate whether combination different biochemical structural outcomes using imaging techniques provide complementary information regarding utilization specific metabolic pathways.
