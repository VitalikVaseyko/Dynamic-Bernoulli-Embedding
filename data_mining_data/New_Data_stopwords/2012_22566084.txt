 L-Serine plays critical role building block cell growth, thus difficult achieve direct fermentation L-serine glucose. study, Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 engineered de novo blocking attenuating conversion L-serine pyruvate glycine, releasing feedback inhibition L-serine 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), combination co-expression 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) feedback-resistant PGDH (PGDH(r)). resulting strain, SER-8, exhibited lower specific growth rate significant differences L-serine levels Phase Phase V determined fed-batch fermentation. intracellular L-serine pool reached (14.22 +/- 1.41) mumol g(CDM) (-1), higher glycine pool, contrary fermentation wild-type strain. Furthermore, metabolic flux analysis demonstrated over-expression PGK directed flux pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards glycolysis pathway (EMP), expression PGDH(r) improved L-serine biosynthesis pathway. addition, flux L-serine glycine dropped 24%, indicating deletion activator GlyR resulted down-regulation serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) expression. Taken together, findings imply L-serine pool management fundamental sustaining viability C. glutamicum, improvement C(1) units generation introducing glycine cleavage system (GCV) degrade excessive glycine promising target L-serine production C. glutamicum.
