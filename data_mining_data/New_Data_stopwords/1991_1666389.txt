 novel mutation fruS localised fru operon obtained. mutation uncouples expression genes determining fructose specific uptake utilization. fruS bacteria fruA fruF genes (coding enzyme II FPr, respectively) become constitutive, fruK gene (responsible fructose-1-phosphate kinase synthesis) remains inducible. contrast already known mutations making whole fru operon constitutive, fruS mutation: 1) lead xylitol sensitivity; 2) depress growth lactate, pyruvate alanine; 3) decrease PEP-synthase activity.
