 Prolonged exercise increased concentrations hexose phosphates phosphoenolpyruvate depressed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, triose phosphates pyruvate liver rat. Since exercise increases gluconeogenic flux, changes metabolite concentrations suggest metabolic control exerted, least, fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate substrate cycles. Exercise increased maximal activities glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase pyruvate carboxylase liver, changes glucokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Exercise changed concentrations several allosteric effectors glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes liver; concentrations acetyl-CoA, ADP AMP increased, whereas ATP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate decreased. effect exercise phosphorylation-dephosphorylation state pyruvate kinase investigated measuring activities conditions saturating subsaturating concentrations substrate. submaximal activity pyruvate kinase (0.5 mM-phosphoenolpyruvate), expressed percentage Vmax., decreased exercised animals less half found controls. changes suggest hepatic pyruvate kinase less active exercise, possibly owing phosphorylation enzyme, may play role increasing rate gluconeogenesis.
