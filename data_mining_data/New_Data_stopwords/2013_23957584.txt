 AIMS: aim study engineer Escherichia coli strains efficiently produce succinate glycerol anaerobic conditions aerobic growth phase. METHODS RESULTS: constructed E. coli strain ss195 deletions pykA pykF, resulted slow growth glycerol sole carbon source. growth defect overcome selection fast-growing mutants. Whole-genome resequencing evolved mutant ss251 identified mutation A595S PEP carboxylase (Ppc). Reverse metabolic engineering introducing wild-type allele revealed mutation crucial described phenotype. Strain ss251 derivatives thereof produced succinate high yields 80% mol mol(-1) glycerol nongrowth conditions. CONCLUSIONS: results show aerobic growth ss251, formation pyruvate proceeds via proposed POMP pathway, starting carboxylation PEP Ppc. resulting oxaloacetate reduced malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) malate, decarboxylated back pyruvate malic enzyme (MaeA MaeB). Mutation ppc crucial fast growth pykAF mutants glycerol. SIGNIFICANCE IMPACT STUDY: E. coli mutant capable achieving high yields succinate (a top valued-added chemical) glycerol (an abundant carbon source) constructed. identified ppc mutation could applied production strains require strong PEP carboxylation fluxes.
