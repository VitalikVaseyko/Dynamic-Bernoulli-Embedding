 Glucose cAMP reciprocally regulate expression L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene controlling formation complex containing carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) L-PK promoter. However, role posttranslational histone modifications opposing effects glucose cAMP L-PK gene unknown. Using highly glucose-sensitive 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line, demonstrated glucose regulates acetylation methylation various histone residues L-PK gene promoter. glucose-dependent histone modifications correlated increase recruitment phosphorylation RNA polymerase II (Pol II) L-PK gene promoter. Conversely, cAMP agonist forskolin prevented glucose-mediated expression L-PK gene decreasing acetylation histones H3 H4 promoter, decreasing methylation H3-K4 coding region, increasing methylation H3-K9 coding region. changes induced cAMP culminated decrease glucose-dependent recruitment phosphorylated Pol II L-PK gene promoter. Furthermore, maneuvers interfere glucose-dependent assembly ChREBP CBP L-PK promoter, increasing intracellular cAMP levels, overexpression dominant-negative form ChREBP, small-interfering-RNA-mediated suppression CBP abundance, altered acetylation methylation histones L-PK promoter, decreased Pol II recruitment subsequently inhibited transcriptional activation L-PK gene. conclude effects glucose cAMP mediated part epigenetic modulation histones.
