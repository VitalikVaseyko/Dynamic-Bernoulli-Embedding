 Triiodothyronine regulates energy metabolism thermogenesis. Among triiodothyronine derivatives, 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (T(2)) shown exert marked effects energy metabolism acting mainly mitochondrial level. investigated capacity T(2) affect skeletal muscle mitochondrial substrate oxidation thermogenesis within 1 h injection hypothyroid rats. Administration T(2) induced increase mitochondrial oxidation palmitoyl-CoA (+104%), palmitoylcarnitine (+80%), succinate (+30%) used substrate, effect pyruvate used. T(2) able 1) activate AMPK-ACC-malonyl-CoA metabolic signaling pathway known direct lipid partitioning toward oxidation 2) increase importing fatty acids mitochondrion. results suggest T(2) stimulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation activating several metabolic pathways, fatty acid import/beta-oxidation cycle/FADH(2)-linked respiratory pathways, fatty acids imported. T(2) also enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial thermogenesis activating pathways involved dissipation proton-motive force associated ATP synthesis ("proton leak"), effect dependent presence free fatty acids inside mitochondria. conclude skeletal muscle target T(2), propose that, activating processes able enhance mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation thermogenesis, T(2) could play role protecting skeletal muscle excessive intramyocellular lipid storage, possibly allowing avoid functional disorders.
