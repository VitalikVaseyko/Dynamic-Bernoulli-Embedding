 Angiogenesis critical cancer growth metastasis. Steps angiogenesis energy consuming, vascular endothelial cells highly glycolytic. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) highly vascular tumor enhances aggressiveness. D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) promising therapeutic protein induces oxidative stress upon acting substrates. Oxidative stress-energy depletion (OSED) therapy recently reported (El Sayed et al., Cancer Gene Ther, 19, 1-18, 2012). OSED combines DAO-induced oxidative stress energy depletion caused glycolytic inhibitors 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), hexokinase II inhibitor depleted ATP cancer cells induced production hydrogen peroxide. 3BP disturbs Warburg effect antagonizes effects lactate pyruvate (El Sayed et al., J Bioenerg Biomembr, 44, 61-79, 2012). Citrate natural organic acid capable inhibiting glycolysis targeting phosphofructokinase. Here, report DAO, 3BP citrate significantly inhibited angiogenesis, decreased number vascular branching points shortened length vascular tubules. OSED delayed growth C6/DAO glioma cells. 3BP combined citrate delayed growth C6 glioma cells decreased significantly number size C6 glioma colonies soft agar. Human GBM cells (U373MG) resistant chemotherapy e.g. cisplatin cytosine arabinoside, 3BP effective decreasing viability disturbing morphology U373MG cells.
