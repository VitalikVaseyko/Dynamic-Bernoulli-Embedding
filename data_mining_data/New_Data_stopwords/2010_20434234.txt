 SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) widely conserved plants. Previous studies shown members SnRK1 subfamily phosphorylate inactivate least four important plant metabolic enzymes: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, sucrose phosphate synthase, nitrate reductase, trehalose phosphate synthase 5. paper, demonstrate two SnRK1 proteins potato, PKIN1 StubSNF1, interact cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PK(c)) potato yeast two-hybrid assay. interacting domain PK(c) located C-terminal region contains putative SnRK1 recognition motif ALHRIGS(500)ASVI. results indicate SnRK1s influence PK(c) activity vivo. Antisense repression SnRK1s alters intensity light/dark periodicity PK activity leaves. However, differences PK activity curves antisense PKIN1 antisense StubSNF1 lines indicated function two kinases identical potato.
