 effects series medium-chain fatty acids (C6-C12) glucose metabolism isolated acini lactating rat mammary glands studied. Hexanoate (C6) octanoate (C8) decanoate (C10), laurate (C12), decreased [1-14C]glucose conversion [14C]lipid production 14CO2 (an index pentose phosphate pathway). hexanoate octanoate, glucose utilization decreased, whereas decanoate slight stimulatory effect glucose utilization, large accumulation lactate. Addition dichloroacetate (an inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) decreased accumulation lactate stimulated conversion [1-14C]glucose [14C]lipid 14CO2. Insulin effect rate glucose utilization presence hexanoate. stimulated rate presence octanoate laurate increased conversion [1-14C]glucose [14C]lipid presence octanoate, decanoate laurate. major fate 1-14C-labelled medium-chain fatty acids (C6, C8 C12) conversion [14C]lipid. proportion converted 14CO2 decreased increasing chain length, whereas rate [14C]lipid formation increased. concluded interactions medium-chain fatty acids glucose metabolism represent feed-back mechanism control milk lipid synthesis, may important milk accumulates gland.
