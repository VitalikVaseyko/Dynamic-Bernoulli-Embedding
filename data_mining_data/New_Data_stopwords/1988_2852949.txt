 role creatine phosphate shuttle energetics muscle protein synthesis isolated polysomes, rat hindlimb muscle, studied. Triton X-100-treated polysomes, following centrifugation 1 sucrose gradient, contained 38 mU/mg RNA bound creatine kinase. presence pH 5 enzyme (obtained rat liver), 0.5 mM ATP, 1 microM GTP, amino acid (leucine) incorporation polysomes presence 8 mM creatine phosphate twice presence exogenous ATP regenerating system 10 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate 10 U/ml pyruvate kinase. Since added creatine kinase effect incorporation supported creatine phosphate clear endogenous creatine kinase allows sufficient regeneration ATP. data also suggest nucleoside diphosphokinase must associated polysome phosphate transferred GTP [33P]creatine phosphate, specific activities ATP GTP increased equal rates, reaching specific activity creatine phosphate 8 min. conclude skeletal muscle polysomes bound creatine kinase activity act terminals creatine phosphate energy shuttle. Creatine phosphate regenerates GTP, probably intermediate reaction catalyzed nucleoside diphosphokinase. provided added support hypothesis compartmentation enzymes substrates transport form energy mitochondria energy utilizing sites muscle creatine phosphate rather ATP, extends general role creatine phosphate energy shuttle.
