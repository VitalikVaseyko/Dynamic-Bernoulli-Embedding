 Fourteen male rabbits born elevation 4000 ft (first experimental series) transferred age 2 months elevation 12470 ft raised 18 weeks. Half animals remained commercial rabbit chow (group H) half diet supplemented cholesterol (group C). Eight male rabbits raised sea level served controls (group S). Intima-media homogenates thoracic aortas assayed lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), lipoamide dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) lysosomal hydrolases beta-glucuronidase N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGA). Aortic lactate glucose also measured. Thirty-two male rabbits (second experimental series) subdivided 4 groups. Rabbits fed cholesterol-supplemented diet high altitude (8 rabbits matching group C) also 8 animals raised sea level. degree atherosclerosis aortas 4 groups assessed measuring aortic cholesterol contents. Plasma cholesterol also determined. aortas rabbits group H activity PK significantly elevated, activity lysosomal hydrolases significantly decreased compared aortas group rabbits. difference enzyme activities aortic glucose lactate content groups. Cholesterol feeding animals group C resulted significantly increased activity lysosomal hydrolases well LDH PK. lipid analyses (second experimental series) revealed trend lower concentration aortic cholesterol high altitude sea level animals, fed cholesterol diet, spite higher plasma cholesterol concentrations high altitude animals. low aortic lysosomal hydrolase activities high altitude rabbits accord comparatively lower susceptibility experimental atherosclerosis. metabolic feature may due lower degree exposure aortas injurious factors, infections lower blood pressure. elevated activity PK without increased lactate content group H animals seems parallel well-known general adaptation organism high altitude hypoxia, indicate metabolic switch toward anaerobic glycolysis.
