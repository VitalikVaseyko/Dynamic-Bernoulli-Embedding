 Autophagy favors cell survival cancer suppression, increasing evidence reveals microRNAs (MIRs) regulate autophagy. Previously reported MIR126 downregulated malignant mesothelioma (MM). Therefore, investigated role MIR126 regulation cell metabolism autophagy MM models. report MIR126 induces autophagic flux MM cells downregulating insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) disrupting IRS1 signaling pathway. specific MM cells, observed non-malignant cells mesothelial origin MM cells expressing MIR126-insensitive IRS1 transcript. MIR126 effect autophagy MM cells recapitulated IRS1 silencing, antagonized IRS1 overexpression antisense MIR126 treatment. MIR126-induced loss IRS1 suppressed glucose uptake, leading energy deprivation AMPK-dependent phosphorylation ULK1. addition, MIR126 stimulated lipid droplet accumulation hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF1alpha)-dependent manner. MIR126 also reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) acetyl-CoA-citrate lyase (ACL) expression, leading accumulation cytosolic citrate paradoxical inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity. Simultaneous pharmacological genetic intervention PDK ACL activity phenocopied effects MIR126. suggests MM MIR126 initiates metabolic program leading high autophagic flux HIF1alpha stabilization, incompatible tumor progression MM. Consistently, MIR126-expressing MM cells injected immunocompromised mice failed progress beyond initial stage tumor formation, showing increased autophagy protective role MM.
