 Glucose catabolism, also known glycolysis, important energy generation involves sequence enzymatic reactions convert glucose molecule two pyruvate molecules. glycolysis process generates adenosine triphosphate byproduct. study, investigated whether glycolysis plays role maintaining neuronal functions Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs), generally accepted olfactory learning memory center. data showed individual knockdown glycolytic enzymes MBs, including hexokinase (HexA), phosphofructokinase (Pfk), pyruvate kinase (PyK), disrupts olfactory memory. Whole-mount brain immunostaining indicated pyruvate kinase strongly expressed MB alphabeta, alpha'beta', gamma neuron subsets. conclude HexA, Pfk, PyK required MB neuron subset olfactory memory formation. data therefore indicates glucose catabolism MBs important olfactory memory formation Drosophila.
