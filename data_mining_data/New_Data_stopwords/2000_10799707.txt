 investigated skeletal muscles nine strains senescence accelerated mouse (SAM), DDD, AKR/J, C57BL/6J, A/J BALB/c mice. found male SAMP8, SAMP7, C57BL/6J, A/J BALB/c mice expressed tubular aggregates (TAs) skeletal muscle. Among strains, SAMP8 strain, exhibits short life span various age-associated neurodegenerative disorders plus mitochondrial dysfunction, showed TAs markedly others. Thus, compared SAMP8 mice SAMR1 mice, accelerated senescence-resistant strain. Light- electron micrographs showed male SAMP8 mice exhibited age-dependent aggravation TA accumulation. significant differences serum lactate/pyruvate levels SAMP8 SAMR1 mice. However, serum creatine kinase (CK) levels 3 6-month-old SAMP8 mice higher corresponding SAMR1 mice. Considering serum CK levels mitochondrial dysfunction SAMP8 mice, conclude TAs may involved homeostasis energy metabolism appropriately regulated SAMP8 mouse mitochondrion.
