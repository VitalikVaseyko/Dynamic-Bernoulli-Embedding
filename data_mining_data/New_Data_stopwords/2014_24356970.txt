 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDKs 1-4) negatively regulate activity mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reversible phosphorylation. PDK isoforms up-regulated obesity, diabetes, heart failure, cancer potential therapeutic targets important human diseases. Here, employed structure-guided design convert known Hsp90 inhibitor series highly specific PDK inhibitors, based structural conservation ATP-binding pocket. key step involved substitution carbonyl group parent compound sulfonyl PDK inhibitors. final compound series, 2-[(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl]isoindoline-4,6-diol, designated PS10, inhibits four PDK isoforms IC50 = 0.8 muM PDK2. administration PS10 (70 mg/kg) diet-induced obese mice significantly augments pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity reduced phosphorylation different tissues. Prolonged PS10 treatments result improved glucose tolerance notably lessened hepatic steatosis mouse model. results support pharmacological approach targeting PDK control glucose fat levels obesity type 2 diabetes.
