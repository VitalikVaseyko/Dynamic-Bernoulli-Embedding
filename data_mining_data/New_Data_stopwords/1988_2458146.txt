 Mature erythrocytes contain specific isozyme pyruvate kinase (R-PK) immature erythroblasts coexpress R-PK another isozyme, M2-PK. determine roles degradation decreasing synthesis played disappearance M2-PK erythroid maturation, M2-PK R-PK synthesis degradation studied erythroblasts fetal liver blood BFU-E-derived erythroblasts healthy subjects, erythroleukemic patient, patient erythrocyte PK hyperactivity associated M2-PK persistence mature erythrocytes. normal erythroblasts, R-PK synthesis constant throughout erythroid maturation, whereas M2-PK synthesis decreased point becoming undetectable. R-PK degradation low, M2-PK degradation pronounced steady erythroid maturation. leukemic erythroblasts, total protein turnover higher normal cells, M2-PK degradation rate lower. erythroblasts patient M2-PK persistence mature erythrocytes, M2-PK synthesis decline cell maturation. conclusion, results emphasize importance decrease M2-PK synthesis disappearance M2-PK erythroid maturation. studies patients pathologic persistence M2-PK synthesis help understanding event involved erythroid maturation.
