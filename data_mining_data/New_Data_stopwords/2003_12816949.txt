 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) enormous impact pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component acting mobile binding framework facilitating mediating regulation PDK activity. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) studies established soluble PDK2 isoform stable dimer. interaction PDK2 lipoyl domains E2 (L1, L2) E3-binding protein (L3) characterized AUC. PDK2 interacted weakly L2 (Kd approximately 175 microM 2 L2/PDK2) much tighter dimeric glutathione S-transferase (GST)-L2 (Kd approximately 3 microM), supporting importance bifunctional binding. Reduction lipoyl groups resulted approximately 8-fold tighter binding PDK2 GST-L2red, approximately 300-fold tighter binding 2 L2red also much tighter binding GST-L1red GST-L3red. E2 60-mer bound approximately 18 PDK2 dimers Kd similar GST-L2. E2.E1 bound PDK2 (approximately 27.6) E2 approximately 2-fold tighter affinity. Lipoate reduction fostered somewhat tighter binding sites E2 severalfold tighter binding majority sites E2.E1. ATP ADP decreased affinity PDK2 E2 3-5-fold adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate phosphorylation E1 similarly reduced PDK2 binding E2.E1. Reversible bifunctional binding L2 mandatory singly held transition fits proposed "hand-over-hand" movement kinase dimer access E1 without dissociating complex. gain binding interactions upon lipoate reduction likely aids reduction-engendered stimulation PDK2 activity; loosening binding result adenine nucleotides phosphorylation may instigate movement lipoyl domain-held kinase new E1 substrate.
