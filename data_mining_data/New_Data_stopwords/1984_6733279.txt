 used complement-fixing antibody consumption ( CFAC ) test detect small concentrations IgG red blood cells patients hemolytic anemias thought caused immune mechanism. Although patients hereditary spherocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency, mechanical hemolytic anemias generally normal concentrations IgG bound red cells (less 25 molecules IgG per red cell), found 39/62 (63%) patients sickle cell anemia elevated values. 39 patients mean 195 maximum 890 molecules IgG per red cell. None patients transfused within previous 90 days, never transfused. Direct antiglobulin tests positive two instances autoantibodies found serum patient. However, eluates red cells 6 23 patients demonstrated antibody activity panel normal red cells indirect antiglobulin test. correlation number IgG molecules patients' red cells severity anemia, incidence painful sickle cell crises, reticulocyte count, blood transfusion history. conclude study immunohematologic abnormalities patients sickle cell anemia warranted, especially view previous reports population patients red cell autoantibodies, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic transfusion reactions without detectable alloantibodies, association episodes pain crises immunologically mediated red cell destruction.
