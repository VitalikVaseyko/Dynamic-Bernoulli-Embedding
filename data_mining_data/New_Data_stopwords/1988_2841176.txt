 Plasma insulin (I), glucagon (G) glucose, hepatic glycogen, fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate (F2, 6-P2), fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, liver key enzymes involved glycolysis (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase (6-PF-2kinase/F-2,6-P2ase), activity ratio (velocity suboptimal substrate concentration/maximum velocity) pyruvate kinase (PK-L] gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity) compared young (2 months) old (16 months) rats upon starvation transition high protein (HP) diet. 10 24 hours dietary switch, plasma glucose decreased less hepatic glycogen less depleted old rats. ratios plasma I/G hepatic 6-PF-2kinase/F-2,6-P2ase higher old rats decrease delayed time points, concentration hepatic F-2,6-P2 activity ratio PK-L (before removal endogenous noncovalent factors). consistency differences indicate mechanisms control glycolysis/gluconeogenesis similar young old rats, appears old rats starved fed HP diet, switch glycolysis gluconeogenesis delayed. suggests result slowness hormonal changes process phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, important short-term regulation glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, may impaired age.
