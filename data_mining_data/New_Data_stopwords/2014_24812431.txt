 IKK epsilon (IKKepsilon) induced activation nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Whole-body IKKepsilon knockout mice high-fat diet (HFD) protected insulin resistance showed altered energy balance. demonstrate IKKepsilon expressed neurons upregulated hypothalamus obese mice, contributing insulin leptin resistance. Blocking IKKepsilon hypothalamus obese mice CAYMAN10576 small interfering RNA decreased NF-kappaB activation tissue, relieving inflammatory environment. Inhibition IKKepsilon activity, TBK1, reduced IRS-1(Ser307) phosphorylation insulin leptin resistance improvement IR/IRS-1/Akt JAK2/STAT3 pathways hypothalamus. improvements independent body weight food intake. Increased insulin leptin action/signaling hypothalamus may contribute decrease adiposity hypophagia enhancement energy expenditure accompanied lower NPY increased POMC mRNA levels. Improvement hypothalamic insulin action decreases fasting glycemia, glycemia pyruvate injection, PEPCK protein expression liver HFD-fed db/db mice, suggesting reduction hepatic glucose production. suggest IKKepsilon may key inflammatory mediator hypothalamus obese mice, hypothalamic inhibition improves energy glucose metabolism.
