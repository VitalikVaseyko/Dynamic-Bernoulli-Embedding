 present biochemical molecular biology study enzyme pyruvate kinase (PYK) parasitic protozoa Leishmania donovani. PYK gene cloned, mutagenised expressed kinetic parameters determined. Like kinetoplastids, L. donovani PYK allosterically stimulated effector fructose 2,6 biphosphate fructose 1,6 biphosphate. putative effector binding site L. donovani PYK mutagenised, obtained two mutants extreme kinetic behavior: Lys453Leu, retained sigmoidal kinetics little affected effector; His480Gln, deployed hyperbolic kinetics changed addition effector. Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies revealed mutations altered effector binding site L. donovani PYK also changed folding domain C.
