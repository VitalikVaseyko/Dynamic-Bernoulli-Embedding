 PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) regulates pyruvate oxidation phosphorylation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA important control point glucose pyruvate metabolism. PDK4 gene expression stimulated thyroid hormone (T(3)), glucocorticoids, long chain fatty acids. effects T(3) gene expression liver mediated via thyroid hormone receptor. Here, identified two binding sites thyroid hormone receptor beta promoter rat PDK4 (rPDK4) gene. addition, investigated role transcriptional coactivators found PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator) enhances T(3) induction rPDK4. Following T(3) administration, increase association PGC-1 alpha rPDK4 promoter. Interestingly, increased association proximal rPDK4 promoter rather distal region gene contains T(3) response elements. Administration T(3) hypothyroid rats elevated abundance PGC-1 alpha mRNA protein liver. addition, observed greater association PGC-1 alpha rPDK4 gene also phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase CPT-1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) genes. Knockdown PGC-1 alpha rat hepatocytes reduced T(3) induction PDK4, PEPCK, CPT-1a genes. results indicate T(3) regulates PGC-1 alpha abundance association hepatic genes, turn PGC-1 alpha important participant T(3) induction selected genes.
