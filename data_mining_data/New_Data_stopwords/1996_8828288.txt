 Mung bean pyruvate kinase (PK) practically free PEP-phosphatase purified 36 fold. enzyme irreversibly inactivated desalting gel filtration dialysis (without EDTA). inactivation also observed presence ATP, Mg2+ thiols prevented non-proteinous, heat stable, small molecular mass factor present mung bean extract. Mung bean PK molecular mass 210 kDa. shows single exponential decay activity various temperatures (-4 60 degrees C). Km PEP ADP found 0.12 0.24 mM, respectively pH 6.5, enzyme saturated second substrate. Km values PEP ADP 0.05 0.16 mM, pH 8.5 0.09 0.17 mM, respectively pH 7.5. optimum pH 7.5. enzyme shows absolute requirement Mg2+ (Km 0.43 mM) Mn2+ ions (Km 0.125 mM). Potassium ions essential activate enzyme presence Mg2+ Mn2+ ions. ATP shows competitive inhibition ADP non-competitive PEP. Kinetic studies different pHs effects ATP suggest formation ternary complex (E.ADP.PEP) combination random compulsory ordered pathways depending experimental conditions.
