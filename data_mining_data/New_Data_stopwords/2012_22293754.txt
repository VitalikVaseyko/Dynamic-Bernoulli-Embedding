 increased glycolytic flux accompanied activation pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) implicated chemoresistance cancer cells. study, found CD44, cell surface marker cancer stem cells, interacts pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) thereby enhances glycolytic phenotype cancer cells either deficient p53 exposed hypoxia. CD44 ablation RNA interference increased metabolic flux mitochondrial respiration concomitantly inhibited entry glycolysis PPP. metabolic changes induced CD44 ablation resulted marked depletion cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) increased intracellular level reactive oxygen species glycolytic cancer cells. Furthermore, CD44 ablation enhanced effect chemotherapeutic drugs p53-deficient hypoxic cancer cells. Taken together, findings suggest metabolic modulation CD44 potential therapeutic target glycolytic cancer cells manifest drug resistance.
