 calmodulin-activated protein kinase identified bovine anterior pituitary membranes. enzyme phosphorylated one endogenous substrate subunit molecular weight 53,000 membranes. Phosphorylation protein rapid, half-maximal 2.5 microM calcium presence saturating concentrations calmodulin (CaM), inhibited trifluoperazine thioridazine. second protein phosphorylated endogenous protein kinase anterior pituitary membranes. Phosphorylation 42,000 Mr protein reduced calcium, independent exogenously added CaM, increased trifluoperazine thioridazine. 42,000 Mr protein may alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase. Calcium-dependent protein phosphorylation also observed intact cells; largest increases seen proteins Mr 42,000, 21,000 17,000.
