 review compare situations major cellular role mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), transiently suppressed. Two types cellular bioenergetics exist, related predominance glycolysis either disconnected fully connected OXPHOS: i) "glycolytic" phenotype, glycolytic end-product pyruvate marginally used OXPHOS; and, ii) OXPHOS phenotype fully developed active OXPHOS machinery consuming pyruvate. switch glycolytic phenotype typically orchestrated gene reprogramming due AMP-activated protein kinase, hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), NFkappaB, mTOR, oncogenes. normoxia continuous hydroxylation HIF1alpha prolines prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) asparagines factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) occurs, resulting HIF1alpha polyubiquitination/degradation. O(2) threshold level (<5% O(2)) cytosolic H(2)O(2) raises oxidizes Fe(2+) PHDs FIH, inactivates them, thus stabilizing HIFalpha upregulating transcription specific genes. source H(2)O(2) burst (not manifested isolated mitochondria) respiratory chain Complex III Q(O) site. Frequently hypoxic microenvironment malignant tumors stimulates HIF-mediated conversion glycolytic state, nevertheless OXPHOS tumors also exist. glycolytic mode predominates prior implantation phase embryonic development, hence embryonic stem cells. Finally, "Poderoso hypothesis" discussed, predicting repetitive conversions transient glycolytic mode meal concomitant insulin signaling. Accordingly, insulin stimulates mitochondrial synthase simultaneously cellular glucose intake. elevated diminishes respiration inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase. Type 2 diabetes may result accumulated impact nitrosative/oxidative stress.
