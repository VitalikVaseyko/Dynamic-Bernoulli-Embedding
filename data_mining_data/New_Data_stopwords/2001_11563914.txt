 Mammalian pyruvate kinase (PK) four-domain enzyme active homo-tetramer. Tissue-specific isozymes PK exhibit distinct levels allosteric regulation. PK expressed muscle tissue (M1-PK) shows hyperbolic steady-state kinetics, whereas PK expressed kidney tissue (M2-PK) displays sigmoidal kinetics. Rabbit M1 M2-PK isozymes whose sequences differ 22 530 residues per subunit, changes localized inter-subunit interface. Previous studies shown single amino acid mutation M1-PK either (S402P) Z (T340 M) subunit interface confer level allosteric regulation intermediate M1-PK M2-PK. effort elucidate roles inter-subunit interaction signal transmission functional/structural connectivity interfaces, S402P mutant M1-PK crystallized structure resolved 2.8 A. Although overall S402P M1-PK structure nearly identical wild-type structure within experimental error, significant differences conformation backbone found site mutation along interface. addition, significant change along Z interface, namely, loss inter-subunit salt-bridge Asp177 domain B Arg341 domain opposing subunit. Concurrent loss salt-bridge increase degree rotational flexibility domain B constitutes active site. Comparison previous PK structures shows correlation increase domain movement loss Asp177: Arg341 salt-bridge. results identify structural linkages Z interfaces regulating interconversion conformational states rabbit M1-PK.
