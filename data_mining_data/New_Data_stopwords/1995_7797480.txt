 rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene transcribed either promoter L liver promoter L' erythroid cells. cloned functionally characterized erythroid-specific enhancer, mapped fetal liver hypersensitive site B (HSSB) 3.7 kilobases upstream promoter L'. Protein-DNA interactions examined 200-base pair core site vivo footprinting experiments. fetal liver, footprints revealed multiple GATA CACC/GT motifs, whose association hallmark erythroid-specific regulatory sequences. Functional analysis HSSB element transgenic mice revealed properties cell-restricted enhancer. Indeed, element able activate linked ubiquitous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter erythroid tissues. activation also observed variety nonerythroid tissues known synthesize GATA-binding factors. context L'-PK transgenes, HSSB needed erythroid-specific activation L' promoter, required stimulate L' promoter activity proper level. Finally, HSSB cannot replaced strong ubiquitous viral cellular enhancers, suggesting preferential interaction HSSB region L' promoter.
