 Chromium recognized essential trace element plays important role carbohydrate metabolism. However, molecular mechanisms involved action clear. study undertaken understand mechanism chromium action experimental diabetes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals administered chromium chromium picolinate (CrP) daily dose 1 mg/kg body weight period 4 weeks. observed chromium complexed picolinate effective lowering plasma glucose levels well able alleviate polyphagia, polydipsia, weight loss diabetic animals. Administration chromium also found normalize glycogen content liver diabetic animals near control levels. reduction plasma glucose levels chromium accompanied increase activity glycolytic enzymes (e.g., glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) suppression activity gluconeogenic enzymes (e.g., glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) liver. Hepatic glucose uptake found increased chromium supplementation demonstrated decrease Km increase Vmax values diabetic animals. Chromium levels lower liver diabetic rats compared control rats. negative correlation observed plasma glucose chromium concentration patients diabetes. data suggests chromium supplementation CrP beneficial correcting hyperglycemia, implying modulation glucose metabolism chromium may therapeutically beneficial treatment diabetes.
