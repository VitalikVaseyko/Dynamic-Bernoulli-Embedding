 Tumor-related activities seem operationally induced division function, inflammation, neoangiogenesis, Warburg effect, immune response, extracellular matrix remodeling, cell proliferation rate, apoptosis, coagulation effects, present systems perspective enhancement complexity. hypothesized, tumor systems-directed therapies might capability use aggregated action effects, adjustable sizes therapeutically modulate tumor systems' stability, homeostasis, robustness. performed retrospective analysis recently published data 224 patients advanced heavily pre-treated (10% 63%) vascular sarcoma, melanoma, renal clear cell, cholangiocellular, carcinoma, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, multivisceral Langerhans' cell histiocytosis enrolled nine multi-center phase II trials (11 centers). patient received multi-targeted systems-directed therapy consisted metronomic low-dose chemotherapy, COX-2 inhibitor, combined one two transcription modulators, pioglitazone +/- dexamethasone IFN-alpha. treatment schedules may attenuate metastatic potential, tumor-associated inflammation, may exert site-specific activities, induce long-term disease stabilization followed prolonged objective response (3% 48%) despite poor monoactivity respective drugs. Progression-free survival data comparable reductionist-designed standard first-line therapies. differential response patterns indicate therapies' systems biological activity. Understanding systems biology adjustable size may break barrier complex tumor-stroma-interactions therapeutically relevant way: Comparatively high efficacy moderate toxicity. Structured systems-directed therapies metastatic cancer may get source detecting topology tumor-associated complex aggregated action effects adjustable sizes available targeted biomodulatory therapies.
