 Streptozotocin treatment (125 mg/kg) Chinese hamster induced hyperglycaemia, hypoinsulinaemia, hyperglucagonaemia changes body, liver, pancreas, stomach, kidney adipose tissue weights. pancreatic reserves insulin glucagon diabetic animals low, stomach glucagon high. animals showed high levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase low levels glucokinase, hexokinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase malic enzyme, normal levels pyruvate kinase liver. Increases lactate dehydrogenase subunit B isozymes 2, 3 4 also observed liver, epididymal fat pad, diabetic animals. N-Acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase elevated plasma, liver heart, kidney treated animals. Renal alpha-galactosidase beta-glucosidase depressed, whereas beta-galactosidase alpha-glucosidase remained essentially normal. features indicated considerable differences biochemical disorders associated streptozotocin-diabetes Chinese hamster published observations rat.
