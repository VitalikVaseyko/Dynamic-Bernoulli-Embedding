 Warburg effect emerged potential hallmark many cancers. However, molecular mechanisms led metabolic state aerobic glycolysis, particularly ovarian cancer (OVCA) completely elucidated. HSulf-1 predominantly functions limiting bioavailability heparan binding growth factors hence downstream signaling. report HSulf-1, known putative tumor suppressor, negative regulator glycolysis. Silencing HSulf-1 expression OV202 cell line increased glucose uptake lactate production upregulating glycolytic genes Glut1, HKII, LDHA, well metabolites. Conversely, HSulf-1 overexpression TOV21G cells resulted regulation glycolytic enzymes reduced glycolytic phenotype, supporting role HSulf-1 loss enhanced aerobic glycolysis. HSulf-1 deficiency mediated glycolytic enhancement also resulted increased inhibitory phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) thus blocking entry glucose flux TCA cycle. Consistent this, metabolomic isotope tracer analysis showed reduced glucose flux TCA cycle. Moreover, HSulf-1 loss associated lower oxygen consumption rate (OCR) impaired mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, lack HSulf-1 promotes c-Myc induction HB-EGF-mediated p-ERK activation. Pharmacological inhibition c-Myc reduced HB-EGF induced glycolytic enzymes implicating major role c-Myc loss HSulf-1 mediated altered glycolytic pathway OVCA. Similarly, PG545 treatment, agent binds heparan binding growth factors sequesters growth factors away ligand also blocked HB-EGF signaling reduced glucose uptake vivo HSulf-1 deficient cells.
