 activity pyruvate kinase (PK), enzyme playing key role glycolysis, studied lung Wistar R/A rats prenatal, postnatal adult periods life. highest level measured 20th gestational day, value nearly double adult mean. order elicit fetal hypothyroidism, pregnant rats treated 0.1% thiourea solution 14th day gestation delivery. animals killed 21st 22nd gestational day 2nd postnatal day. significant increase PK activity seen treated animals compared control group, activity phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAPase) remained unchanged. Fetal hyperthyroidism induced intravenous injections TRH pregnant mother rat. resulted increase PAPase decrease PK activity compared control group. difference statistically significant instances, level significance, however, depended time treatment initiated.
