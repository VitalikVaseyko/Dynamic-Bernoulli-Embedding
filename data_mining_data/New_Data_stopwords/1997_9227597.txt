 measured enzyme activities along heterothermic tissue, visceral retia mirabilia bluefin tuna, test current theories enzyme temperature adaptation. heterothermic tissue model ideal study fundamental temperature adaptation eliminates confounding effects whole animal acclimation. Enzymes measured six positions along rete four temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C). Five enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, citrate synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase) exhibited significant positive compensatory effect, activity cold end rete 1.2-3.1 times higher warm end. Two enzymes (alanine aminotransferase lactate dehydrogenase) exhibited significant compensation. basis activation energies enzymes along rete, differences activity due differences enzyme concentration isozymes enzyme modification. Analysis compensatory responses enzymes light thermal sensitivities leads us conclude pentose phosphate shunt especially enhanced cold end rete.
