 Somali cat presented recurrent anorexia, lethargy, vomiting icterus. macrocytic-hypochromic, regenerative haemolytic anaemia identified hereditary pyruvate kinase deficiency confirmed means breed-specific DNA mutation analysis. case complicated presence markedly elevated serum liver enzyme activities, hyperbilirubinaemia, coagulopathy ultrasonographic evidence gall bladder choleliths extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. choleliths consisted 100 per cent bilirubin, likely chronic haemolysis haeme degradation. conclusion, haemosiderosis bilirubin cholelithiasis consequence chronic haemolysis pyruvate kinase-deficient cats, seen human beings variety chronic haemolytic disorders.
