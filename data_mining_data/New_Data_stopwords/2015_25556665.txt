 AIMS: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) essential maintenance nicotinamide dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate (NADPH) levels redox homeostasis. number drugs, antimalarial drugs, act induce reactive oxygen species hemolytic crisis G6PD-deficient patients. used diamide (DIA) mimic drug-induced oxidative stress studied drugs affect cellular metabolism using metabolomic approach. RESULTS: differences metabolome red blood cells (RBCs) normal G6PD-deficient individuals. DIA causes modest changes normal RBC metabolism. contrast, significant changes various biochemical pathways, namely glutathione (GSH) metabolism, purine metabolism, glycolysis, G6PD-deficient cells. GSH depletion concomitant shift energy metabolism. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) accumulation activates AMP protein kinase (AMPK) increases entry glucose glycolysis. However, inhibition pyruvate kinase (PK) reduces efficacy energy production. Metabolic changes protein oxidation occurs greater extent G6PD-deficient RBCs normal cells, leading severe irreversible loss deformability former. INNOVATION CONCLUSION: Normal G6PD-deficient RBCs differ responses oxidants. Normal cells adequate NADPH regeneration maintenance GSH pool. contrast, G6PD-deficient cells unable regenerate enough NADPH stressful situation, switch biosynthetic pathway GSH supply. Rapid GSH exhaustion causes energy crisis futile AMPK activation. findings suggest drug-induced oxidative stress differentially affects metabolism metabolite signaling normal G6PD-deficient cells. also provides insight pathophysiology acute hemolytic anemia G6PD-deficient patients.
