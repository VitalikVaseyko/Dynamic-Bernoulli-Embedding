 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) inactivated many tissues starvation diabetes. investigated carbohydrate oxidation (CHO) regulation PDC lean obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats fed starved conditions well oral glucose load without pharmacologically reduced levels free fatty acids (FFA) estimate relative contribution FFA glucose tolerance, CHO, PDC activity. increase total PDC activity (20-45%) paralleled increased protein levels ( approximately 2-fold) PDC subunits liver muscle obese ZDF rats. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) protein levels higher obese rats, consequently PDC activity reduced. Although PDK4 protein levels rapidly downregulated (57-62%) lean obese animals within 2 h glucose challenge, CHO 3 h well peak PDC activity (1 h glucose load) liver muscle significantly lower obese rats compared lean rats. Similar differences obtained pharmacologically suppressed FFA nicotinic acid, significantly improved glucose tolerance obese rats, well increased CHO delta increases PDC activity (0-60 min) muscle liver. results demonstrated suppressive role FFA acids measured parameters. Furthermore, results clearly demonstrate rapid reactivation PDC liver muscle lean obese rats glucose load show PDC activity significantly lower obese ZDF rats.
