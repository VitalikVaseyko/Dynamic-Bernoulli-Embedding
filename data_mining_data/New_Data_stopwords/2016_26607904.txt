 Dichloroacetate (DCA), orphan drug promotes shift glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, repurposed cancer therapy. present study investigated whether DCA may overcome cisplatin resistance head neck cancer (HNC). Two cisplatin-resistant HNC cell lines (AMC-HN4R -HN9R), parental lines, human HNC lines used. effect DCA, alone combination cisplatin, assessed measuring cell cycle, viability, death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), protein expression preclinical mouse tumor xenograft models. Increased glycolysis correlated decreased sensitivity cisplatin reduced DCA. Cisplatin-resistant cells overexpressed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2). DCA induced HNC cell death decreasing DeltaPsim promoting mitochondrial ROS production. effect decreased antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine inhibition caspase-mediated apoptosis. Activation mitochondrial glucose oxidation DCA eventually activated downstream mitochondrial apoptotic signaling, leading death chemoresistant cancer cells. Therefore, DCA significantly sensitized resistant HNC cells cisplatin vitro vivo. High glycolysis PDK2 overexpression closely linked cisplatin resistance HNC cells; latter overcome DCA.
