 cell cycle mitogen stimulated rat thymocytes, 8-10-fold induction glycolytic enzymes corresponding increase mRNA levels observed. prompted us study transcriptional regulation rat aldolase pyruvate kinase genes. cis-Regulatory elements promoters evaluated site-directed mutagenesis promoter/luciferase constructs transient transfections rat hepatoma FTO2B cells. Furthermore, binding proteins identified mobility shift assays presence specific antibodies. aldolase AH1 promoter, five binding sites Sp1 Sp3 TPA responsive element identified essential transcriptional regulation. promoter activity attributed regulatory elements. pyruvate kinase promoter three five binding sites Sp1 Sp3 (B box GC boxes 1 3) turned functional transfection assays whereas disruption GC box 2 effect, disruption GC box 4 minor effect promoter activity. promoters stimulated Sp1 well Sp3, judged cotransfection experiments Drosophila SL2 cells. Therefore, Sp1- Sp3-directed transcription provides means common regulatory mechanism aldolase pyruvate kinase genes.
