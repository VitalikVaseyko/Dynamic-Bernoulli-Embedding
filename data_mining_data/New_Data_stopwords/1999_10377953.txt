 presence NH4Cl hypotonic solutions, Rana balcanica red cells respond increasing volume. stimulation cellular volume hypotonicity rapid NH4Cl, maximum value less observed presence NH4Cl. Depending cause swelling, (nct uptake NH4Cl decrease external osmolality) cells show specific responses. NH4Cl treatment causes significant increase intracellular Na+, 5.14 +/- 0.78 29.84 +/- 0.47 mmoles l-1 cell, hypotonicity leads significant decrease cation, 3.85 +/- 0.25 mmoles l-1 cell relation control, 30 min incubation Rana balcanica erythrocytes. addition, amiloiride significantly reverses NH4Cl effect respect intracellular Na+. treatments cause significant K+ loss comparison controls. Two glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) Rana balcanica haemolysate found respond NH4Cl effect significantly decreasing activity.
