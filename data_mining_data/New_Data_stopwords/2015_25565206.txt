 Macrophages activated TLR4 agonist LPS undergo dramatic changes metabolic activity. show LPS induces expression key metabolic regulator Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). Activation PKM2 using two well-characterized small molecules, DASA-58 TEPP-46, inhibited LPS-induced Hif-1alpha IL-1beta, well expression range Hif-1alpha-dependent genes. Activation PKM2 attenuated LPS-induced proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype promoting traits typical M2 macrophage. show LPS-induced PKM2 enters complex Hif-1alpha, directly bind IL-1beta promoter, event inhibited activation PKM2. compounds inhibited LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming succinate production. Finally, activation PKM2 TEPP-46 vivo inhibited LPS Salmonella typhimurium-induced IL-1beta production, boosting production IL-10. PKM2 therefore critical determinant macrophage activation LPS, promoting inflammatory response.
