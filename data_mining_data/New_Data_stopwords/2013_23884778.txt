 CONTEXT: suggested human cultured primary myotubes retain metabolic characteristics donor vitro. OBJECTIVES: aim present study investigate whether metabolic responses endurance training also conserved culture. DESIGN VOLUNTEERS: Middle-aged obese subjects completed 8-week supervised aerobic exercise training program vastus lateralis muscle biopsies collected training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anthropometric blood parameters, well aerobic capacity, assessed training. Muscle biopsies either used Western blot analysis digested harvest myogenic progenitors differentiated myotubes. Glucose oxidation, palmitate oxidation, glycogen synthesis assays performed myotubes training. Gene expression assessed real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: data indicate parallel vivo improvement whole-body aerobic capacity glucose metabolism, biopsy-derived primary myotubes showed similar patterns vitro. Indeed, glucose oxidation, glycogen synthesis, inhibition palmitate oxidation glucose enhanced myotubes training. associated consistent changes expression metabolism-linked genes GLUT1, PDK4, PDHA1. Interestingly, difference myogenic differentiation capacity observed training. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise training associated metabolic adaptations vivo preserved human cultured primary myotubes. hypothesized skeletal muscle microenvironmental changes induced endurance training lead metabolic imprinting myogenic progenitor cells.
