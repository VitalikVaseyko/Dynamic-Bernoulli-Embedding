 One important limitations mammalian cell-based processes secretion accumulation lactate by-product metabolism. Among cell lines commonly used industrial bioprocesses, HEK293 gaining importance last years. recently, HEK293 cells known consume lactate late stages cell culture usually glucose and/or glutamine depleted media. Remarkably, scenarios, significant cell growth reported. However, observed different metabolic behavior regarding lactate production consumption HEK293 cultures. HEK293 cells able co-metabolize glucose lactate simultaneously, even exponentially growing cell cultures. deep study effects environmental conditions lactate metabolism revealed pH key trigger metabolic shift lactate production lactate glucose concomitant consumption. Remarkably, shift could triggered pH set 6.8. Even interesting fact lowering pH 6.6 supplementing media exogenous lactate resulted co-consumption glucose lactate beginning cell culture, without affecting cell growth protein productivity. contrary, cell growth clearly hampered low pH extracellular lactate lacking. results, hypothesize HEK293 cells metabolize extracellular lactate strategy pH detoxification, means co-transporting extracellular protons together lactate cytosol. novel hypothesis unraveling lactate metabolism HEK293 cells could open door re-direct genetic engineering strategies order obtain efficient cell lines also develop animal cell technology applications.
