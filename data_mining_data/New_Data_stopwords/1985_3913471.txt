 standard procedure identification N-terminal amino acid N alpha-acylated proteins developed. exhaustive proteolysis, amino acids blocked alpha-amino groups separated positively charged, free amino acids ion exchange chromatography subjected digestion acylase I. Amino acid analysis acylase treatment identifies blocked N-terminal amino acid. survey acylamino acid substrates showed acylase liberate common amino acids except Asp, Cys Pro N-acetyl-and N-butyryl derivatives, also catalyze hydrolysis N-formyl-Met N-myristyl-Val. Thus, procedure cannot identify acylated Asp, Cys Pro, nor, ion exchange step, N alpha-acyl-derivatives Arg, Lys His. Whenever protease treatment releases free acylamino acids, remaining amino acids detected. applied several proteins, procedure confirmed known N-terminal acylamino acids identified acyl-Ser enolases chum coho salmon muscle pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle, acyl-Thr phosphofructokinase rabbit muscle. protease-acylase assay used identify blocked peptides CNBr- protease-treated proteins. peptides treated 1 N HCl 110 degrees 10 min, sufficient yields deacylated, mostly intact, peptide obtained permit direct automatic sequencing. N-terminal sequences rabbit muscle coho salmon enolase determined way compared sequence yeast enolase.
