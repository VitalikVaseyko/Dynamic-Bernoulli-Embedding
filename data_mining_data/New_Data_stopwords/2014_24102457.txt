 Green 'Anjou' pear bud mutation, red 'Anjou' compared understand differences phenolic metabolism effect primary metabolism. flesh two cultivars, difference detected concentration phenolic compound, transcript level MYB10 transcript levels activities key enzymes involved anthocyanin synthesis. Compared green 'Anjou', shaded peel red 'Anjou' higher anthocyanin concentrations, higher transcript levels MYB10 higher activity UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT), suggesting MYB10 regulates UFGT control anthocyanin synthesis red 'Anjou' peel. sun-exposed peel, activities phenylalanine ammonia lyase, dihydroflavonol reductase, flavonol synthase anthocyanidin synthase well UFGT higher red 'Anjou' green 'Anjou'. peel red 'Anjou' higher activities sorbitol dehydrogenase, raffinose synthase sucrose synthase higher levels raffinose, myo-inositol starch, indicating sorbitol metabolism, raffinose synthesis starch synthesis upregulated red 'Anjou'. flesh red 'Anjou' higher concentrations glucose, lower activities ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase lower dark respiration. peel red 'Anjou' higher activities glutaminase, asparagine synthetase asparaginase, higher concentrations asparagine, aspartate, alanine, valine, threonine isoleucine. effects anthocyanin synthesis primary metabolism fruit peel discussed.
