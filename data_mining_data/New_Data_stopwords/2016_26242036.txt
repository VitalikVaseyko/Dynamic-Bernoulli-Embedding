 OBJECTIVE: investigate effects prostate stromal cells different zones normal prostate tissue growth prostate cancer cells action mechanisms. METHODS: extracted stromal cells fresh normal prostatic tissue derived peripheral zone (PZ) transitional zone (TZ), amplified vitro, used supernatants cells conditioned media culture hormone-resistant prostate cancer DU145 cells. measured growth curve tumor cells using CCK8 method, determined number viability cells trypan blue staining, evaluated invasiveness scratch test, detected effects stromal cells key enzymes glycolysis tumor cells Western blot. RESULTS: conditioned medium PZ-derived stromal cells promoted, TZ-derived stromal cells inhibited growth tumor cells. former significantly increased, latter markedly decreased expressions key enzymes hexokinase 2 (HK-2), pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM-2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) glycolysis tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Prostate stromal cells different zones exert different influences growth tumor cells, may associated different effects glycolysis tumor cells.
