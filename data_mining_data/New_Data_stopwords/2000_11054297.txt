 provide statistically reliable sequence evidence indicating least 12 23 SCOP (betaalpha)(8) (TIM) barrel superfamilies share common origin. includes one known predicted TIM barrels found central metabolism. statistical evidence complemented examination details protein structure, certain structural locations favouring catalytic residues even though nature molecular function may change. combined analysis sequence, structure function also enables us propose phylogeny TIM barrels. Based data, able examine differing theories pathway enzyme evolution, mapping known TIM barrel folds pathways central metabolism. results favour widespread recruitment enzymes pathways, rather "backwards evolution" model, support idea modern proteins may arisen common ancestors bound key metabolites.
