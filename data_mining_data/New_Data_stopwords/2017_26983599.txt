 Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) target gliptins, recent class oral antidiabetics. DPP4 (also called CD26) previously characterized immune cells also important metabolic functions yet fully understood. Thus, investigated function DPP4 human white preadipocytes adipocytes. found cell types express DPP4 high amounts; DPP4 release markedly increased differentiation. preadipocytes, lentiviral DPP4 knockdown caused significant changes gene expression determined whole-genome DNA-array analysis. Metabolic genes increased, e.g. PDK4 18-fold PPARgammaC1alpha (=PGC1alpha) 6-fold, proliferation-related genes decreased (e.g. FGF7 5-fold). effects, contributing differentiation, inhibited PPARgamma antagonist T0070907. Vice versa, PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone induced different set genes (mainly FABP4). DPP4 knockdown also affected growth factor signaling and, accordingly, retarded preadipocyte proliferation. particular, basal insulin-induced ERK activation (but Akt activation) markedly diminished (by around 60%). indicates DPP4 knockdown contributes adipocyte maturation mimicking growth factor withdrawal, early step fat cell differentiation. mature adipocytes, DPP4 becomes liberated adipose tissue may constitute relevant source circulating DPP4.
