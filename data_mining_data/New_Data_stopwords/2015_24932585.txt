 effective integrated organization processes cardiac cells achieved, part, functional compartmentation energy transfer processes. Earlier, using permeabilized cardiomyocytes, demonstrated existence tight coupling cardiomyocyte ATPases glycolysis rat. work, studied contribution two membrane ATPases whether coupled glycolysis--sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) plasmalemma Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA). SERCA activity minor preparation absence calcium, major role NKA revealed accounting approximately 30% total ATPase activity demonstrates permeabilized cell preparation used study pump. elucidate contribution NKA pool ATPases, series kinetic measurements performed cells NKA inhibited 2 mM ouabain. cells, recorded: ADP- ATP-kinetics respiration, competition ADP mitochondria pyruvate kinase (PK), ADP-kinetics endogenous PK, ATP-kinetics total ATPases. experimental data analyzed using series mathematical models varying compartmentation levels. results show NKA tightly coupled glycolysis undetectable flux ATP mitochondria NKA. tight coupling NKA PK line increased importance pathological states heart substrate preference shifts glucose.
