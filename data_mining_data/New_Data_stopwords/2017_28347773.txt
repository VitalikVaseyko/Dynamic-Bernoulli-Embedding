 cancer cells exhibit high rate glycolysis reduced capacity mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) found increased many cancer cells. Inhibition PDKs increases oxidative phosphorylation glucose, may disrupt balance demand supply oxygen cancer cell, thus leading cell death. Several reports suggested compounds containing (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide group could inhibit PDKs pyruvate dehydrogenase primary enzymatic assay. However, none capable reducing growth cancer cells. Herein, report synthesis biological evaluation novel PDK1 inhibitors containing (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide warhead. Excitingly, novel PDK1 inhibitors exhibited good potency reduce growth cancer cells. demonstrated compounds could physically associate PDK1 activate pyruvate dehydrogenase low micromolar levels.
