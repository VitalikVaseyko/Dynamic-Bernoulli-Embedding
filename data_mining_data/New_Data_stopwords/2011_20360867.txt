 BACKGROUND: type 1 diabetes (T1D) vascular complications accelerated atherosclerosis diffused macro-/microangiopathy linked chronic hyperglycemia mechanism yet well understood. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) worsens diabetic complications, particularly, risk morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease increased several fold. METHODS FINDINGS: evaluated protein regulation expression skin biopsies obtained T1D patients without ESRD, identify pathways persistent cellular changes linked diabetic vascular disease. therefore examined pathways may normalized restoration normoglycemia kidney-pancreas (KP) transplantation. Using proteomic ultrastructural approaches, multiple alterations expression proteins involved oxidative stress (catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, Hsp27, Hsp60, ATP synthase delta chain, flavin reductase), aerobic anaerobic glycolysis (ACBP, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme, phosphoglycerate kinase 1), intracellular signaling (stratifin-14-3-3, S100-calcyclin, cathepsin, PPI rotamase) well endothelial vascular abnormalities identified T1D T1D+ESRD patients. abnormalities reversed KP transplant. Increased plasma levels malondialdehyde observed T1D T1D+ESRD patients, confirming increased oxidative stress normalized KP transplant. CONCLUSIONS: data suggests persistent cellular changes anti-oxidative machinery aerobic/anaerobic glycolysis present T1D T1D+ESRD patients, abnormalities may play key role pathogenesis hyperglycemia-related vascular complications. Restoration normoglycemia removal uremia KP transplant correct abnormalities. identified pathways may become potential therapeutic targets new generation drugs.
