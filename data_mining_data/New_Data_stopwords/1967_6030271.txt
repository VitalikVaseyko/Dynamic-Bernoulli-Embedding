 1. administration cortisol glucocorticoid steroids starved mice produced increase liver glycogen content, elevation glycogen-synthetase activity predominantly particulate localization phosphorylase glycogen-synthetase enzymes. 2. Three daily doses actinomycin caused marked glycogen depletion, significant decrease glycogen-synthetase activity, solubilization phosphorylase glycogen synthetase following effects activities various enzymes: decrease UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase phosphoglucomutase, increase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase change glucose 6-phosphatase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. 3. Glucose ingestion, cortisol administration, reversed effects actinomycin liver glycogen content activities phosphorylase glycogen synthetase.
