 Bacillus globisporus Bacillus psychrophilus one among many pairs ecologically distinct taxa distinguished nucleotide differences 16S rRNA gene sequence. study investigated whether lack divergence 16S rRNA species stems unusually slow rate evolution molecule, whether factors might preventing neutral sequence divergence 16S rRNA well every gene. B. globisporus B. psychrophilus surveyed restriction-site variation two protein-coding genes. species easily distinguished separate DNA sequence clusters gene. limited ability 16S rRNA distinguish species therefore consequence extremely slow rate 16S rRNA evolution. present results, previous results involving two Mycobacterium species, demonstrate exist closely related species diverged long enough formed clearly separate sequence clusters protein-coding genes, 16S rRNA. results support earlier argument sequence clustering protein-coding genes could primary criterion discovering identifying ecologically distinct groups, classifying separate species.
