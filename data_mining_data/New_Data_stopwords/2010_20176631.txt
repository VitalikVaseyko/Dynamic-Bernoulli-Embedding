 recently provided evidence suggesting role cytokine-mediated inhibition Akt/Forkhead box 1 (FOXO1) signalling induction muscle atrophy impairment muscle carbohydrate oxidation lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxaemia rats. hypothesized low-dose dexamethasone (Dex; anti-inflammatory agent) infusion endotoxaemia would prevent LPS-induced impairment Akt/FOXO1 signalling, therefore prevent muscle atrophy impairment carbohydrate oxidation. Chronically instrumented Sprague-Dawley rats received continuous intravenous infusion LPS (15 microg kg(-1) h(-1)), Dex (12.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1)), Dex+LPS saline 24 h 0.4 ml h(-1). LPS infusion caused haemodynamic changes consistent hyperdynamic circulation induced increases muscle tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 10-fold, P < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6; 14-fold, P < 0.001) metallothionein-1A (MT-1A; 187-fold, P < 0.001) mRNA expression. Dex co-administration abolished haemodynamic effects LPS reduced increase muscle TNF-alpha, IL-6 MT-1A 51% (P < 0.01), 85% (P < 0.001) 58% (P < 0.01), respectively. Dex infusion endotoxaemia also prevented LPS-induced 40% reduction muscle protein:DNA ratio decrease Akt phosphorylation, partially prevented reduction FOXO1 phosphorylation. However, Dex prevent LPS-mediated increase muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) mRNA expression, significantly reduce LPS-mediated increase cathepsin-L mRNA expression enzyme activity 43% (P < 0.001) 53% (P < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, Dex suppressed LPS-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA upregulation approximately 50% (P < 0.01), prevented LPS-mediated muscle glycogen breakdown lactate accumulation. Thus, low-dose Dex infusion endotoxaemia prevented muscle atrophy impairment carbohydrate oxidation, potentially suppression cytokine-mediated Akt/FOXO inhibition, blunting cathepsin-L-mediated lysosomal protein breakdown.
