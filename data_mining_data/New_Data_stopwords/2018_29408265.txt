 Cancer cells encounter metabolic stresses hypoxia nutrient limitations grow divide quickly normal counterparts. response glucose restriction, found nuclear translocation glycolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), helped cancer cells survive metabolic stress. Restriction glucose stimulated AMPK activation resulted co-translocation AMPK PKM2 Ran-mediated nuclear transport. Nuclear PKM2 subsequently bound Oct4 promoted expression cancer stemness-related genes, might enrich cancer stem cell population metabolic stress. Nuclear PKM2 also capable promoting cancer metastasis orthotopic xenograft model. summary, found cytosolic AMPK helped PKM2 carry nonmetabolic functions nucleus glucose restriction nuclear PKM2 promoted cancer stemness metastasis. findings suggested potential new targeting pathway cancer therapy future.
