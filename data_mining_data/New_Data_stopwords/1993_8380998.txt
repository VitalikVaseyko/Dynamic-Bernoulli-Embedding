 actions phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) glucose metabolism, amino acid transport enzyme inductions studied primary cultures adult-rat hepatocytes compared effects insulin. PMA insulin stimulated glycolysis 5- 7-fold respectively. half-maximal effective dose PMA 60 nM. Stimulation glycolysis accompanied insulin- PMA-dependent okadaic acid-sensitive activation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pyruvate kinase, well increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Glucose production glycogen decreased 50% PMA 15% insulin, whereas glycogen synthesis stimulated 2- 7-fold respectively. PMA also increased aminoisobutyrate uptake, induced ornithine decarboxylase counteracted glucagon-dependent induction phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. PMA strongly antagonized hormonal activation glycogen synthesis, insulin actions assayed decreased phorbol ester. Whereas additive effects PMA insulin detected, PMA simultaneous increase glucose concentration additive effects glycolysis glycogen metabolism. Cell exposure insulin resulted receptor autophosphorylation 10-fold activation receptor tyrosine kinase. PMA alter effects, also effect receptor phosphorylation status absence insulin. Long-term (15 h) pretreatment cells PMA abolished PMA effects, insulin effects. concluded PMA generally antagonize action insulin differentiated adult hepatocytes, insulin PMA may use related signal-transduction pathways.
