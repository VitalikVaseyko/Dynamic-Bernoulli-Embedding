 Human red cell contain soluble adenosine-3',5'-phosphate-dependent protein kinases, able phosphorylate L' subunits erythrocyte pyruvate kinase. Efficiency maximum level phosphorylation comparable human liver red cells. Phosphorylation red cell pyruvate kinase results kinetic modifications liver enzyme, namely shift towards 'T' allosteric state characterized decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate increased inhibition allosteric inhibitors ATP alanine. course red cell aging small amount partially proteolysed pyruvate kinase, devoid phosphorylatable site, appears; resembles subtilisin-treated L'4 enzyme accounts less 20% total pyruvate kinase subunits. Endogenous phosphorylation pyruvate kinase erythrocytes incubated presence cyclic nucleotides produces kinetic modifications phosphorylation partially purified extract; this, however, change glucose consumption, lactate production glycolytic intermediate concentrations incubated cells.
