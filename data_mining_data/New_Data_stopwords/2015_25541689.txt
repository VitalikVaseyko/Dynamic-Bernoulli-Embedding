 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) aggressive tumor, high mortality rate due late symptom presentation frequent tumor recurrences metastasis. also rapidly growing tumor supported different metabolic mechanisms; nevertheless, biological molecular mechanisms involved metabolic reprogramming HCC unclear. study, found pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) frequently over-expressed human HCCs over-expression associated aggressive clinicopathological features poor prognosis HCC patients. Furthermore, knockdown PKM2 suppressed aerobic glycolysis cell proliferation HCC cell lines vitro. Importantly, knockdown PKM2 hampered HCC growth subcutaneous injection orthotopic liver implantation models, reduced lung metastasis vivo. significance, PKM2 over-expression human HCCs associated down-regulation liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. showed miR-122 interacted 3UTR PKM2 gene. Re-expression miR-122 HCC cell lines reduced PKM2 expression, decreased glucose uptake vitro, suppressed HCC tumor growth vivo. clinical data functional studies revealed novel biological mechanism involved HCC metabolic reprogramming.
