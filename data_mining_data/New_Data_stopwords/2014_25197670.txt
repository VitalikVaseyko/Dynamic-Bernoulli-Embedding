 Autophagy highly regulated-cell pathway degrading long-lived proteins well clearing cytoplasmic organelles. Autophagy key contributor cellular homeostasis metabolism. Warburg hypothesized cancer growth frequently associated deviation set energy generation mechanisms nonoxidative breakdown glucose. cellular phenomenon seems rely respiratory impairment, linked mitochondrial dysfunction. mitochondrial dysfunction results switch anaerobic glycolysis. recently suggested epithelial cancer cells may induce Warburg effect neighboring stromal fibroblasts autophagy activated. series observations drove proposal putative reverse Warburg effect pathophysiological relevance for, least, tumor phenotypes. review introduce autophagy process regulation selective pathways role cancer cell metabolism. define describe Warburg effect newly suggested "reverse" hypothesis. also discuss potential value modulating autophagy several pharmacological agents able modify Warburg effect. association Warburg effect cancer stromal cells tumor-related autophagy may relevance development experimental therapeutics well cancer prevention.
