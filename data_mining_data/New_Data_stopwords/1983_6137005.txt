 Work phosphorylation proteins dynamic process involved regulation biological processes started 1950s finding phosphorylase phosphorylase b phospho dephospho forms enzyme. field expanded sharply late 1960s discovery cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, clear phosphorylation-dephosphorylation constitutes major type regulation almost common allosteric control. protein kinases, catalyse phosphorylation step various phosphorylation-dephosphorylation systems, divided two main classes, serine-threonine protein kinases tyrosine protein kinases. class subdivided groups entities depending nature agent(s) regulate activity.
