Hydrogen ions increase affinity inhibitory binding sites phosphoenol pyruvate Mg2+ ions. Assuming partial conformational states high low affinity inhibitory binding sites, data presented good agreement predictions postulated two-state concerted-symmetry model Monod, Wyman, Changeux. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate L-alanine show opposite effects interactions phosphoenol pyruvate Mg2+ ions respective catalytic inhibitory binding sites. pH 6.0, regulation Phycomyces pyruvate kinase activity concentrations phosphoenol pyruvate Mg2+ ions controlled mainly L-alanine.
