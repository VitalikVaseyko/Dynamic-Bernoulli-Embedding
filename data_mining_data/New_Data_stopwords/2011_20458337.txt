 Professional antigen-presenting cells secrete major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) carrying exosomes unclear physiological function(s). Exosomes first generated intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) specific type multivesicular body, secreted fusion compartment plasma membrane. previously shown contrast sorting MHC II lysosomally targeted multivesicular bodies, sorting MHC II exosomes rely MHC II ubiquitination. search proteins drive incorporation MHC II exosomes functionally discriminate exosomal plasma membrane MHC II, first analyzed total proteome highly purified B cell-derived exosomes using sensitive accurate mass spectrometry (MS), identified 539 proteins, including known previously identified constituents. Using quantitative MS, identified small subset proteins specifically co-immunoprecipitated MHC II detergent-solubilized exosomes. include HSC71, HSP90, 14-3-3varepsilon, CD20 pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), speculate functionality interaction exosomal MHC II.
