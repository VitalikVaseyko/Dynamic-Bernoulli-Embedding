 binding modes series molecules, containing glucosamine (1-->6) myo-inositol structural motif, ATP binding site catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) analysed using molecular docking. calculations predict presence phosphate group non-reducing end pseudodisaccharide pseudotrisaccharide structures properly orientate molecule binding site pseudotrisaccharide structures present best shape complementarity. Therefore, pseudodisaccharides pseudotrisaccharides synthesised common intermediates using effective synthetic strategies. basis synthetic chemistry, feasibility constructing small pseudotrisaccharide libraries solid-phase using intermediates explored. results biological evaluation molecules provide additional support insulin-mediated signalling system involves intermediacy inositolphosphoglycans putative insulin mediators.
