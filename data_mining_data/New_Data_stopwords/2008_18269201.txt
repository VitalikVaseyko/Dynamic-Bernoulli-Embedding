 endurance training, exercising skeletal muscle experiences severe repetitive oxygen stress, muscle's ability cope improve function stress central role body. primary transcriptional response factor hypoxic adaptation hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), upregulates glycolysis angiogenesis response low levels tissue oxygenation. examine role HIF-1alpha endurance training, created mice specifically lacking skeletal muscle HIF-1alpha subjected endurance training protocol. found wild type mice improve oxidative capacity, measured respiratory exchange ratio; surprisingly, found HIF-1alpha null mice already upregulated parameter without training. Furthermore, untrained HIF-1alpha null mice increased capillary fiber ratio, elevated oxidative enzyme activities. changes correlate constitutively activated AMP-activated protein kinase HIF-1alpha null muscles. Additionally, HIF-1alpha null muscles decreased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase I, HIF-1alpha target inhibits oxidative metabolism. data demonstrates removal HIF-1alpha causes adaptive response skeletal muscle akin endurance training, provides evidence suppression mitochondrial biogenesis HIF-1alpha normal tissue.
