 Escherichia coli contains 30 two-component systems (TCSs), consisting histidine kinase response regulator. Whereas TCSs well characterized model organism, little known YpdA/YpdB system. identify YpdB-regulated genes, compared transcriptomes E. coli cells overproducing either YpdB control protein. Expression levels 15 genes differed 1.9-fold two strains. comprehensive evaluation genes identified yhjX sole target YpdB. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays purified YpdB confirmed interaction yhjX promoter. Specifically, YpdB binds two direct repeats motif GGCATTTCAT separated 11-bp spacer yhjX promoter. yhjX encodes cytoplasmic membrane protein unknown function belongs major facilitator superfamily transporters. Finally, characterized pattern yhjX expression identified extracellular pyruvate stimulus YpdA/YpdB system. suggested YpdA/YpdB contributes nutrient scavenging entry stationary phase.
