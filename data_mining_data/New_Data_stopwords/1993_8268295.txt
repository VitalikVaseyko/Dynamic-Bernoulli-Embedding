 shown phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pigeon breast muscle endogenous ATP-dependent protein kinase suppresses substrate conversion pyruvate: acceptor oxidoreductase reactions nonoxidative reactions monitored pyruvate decline absence CoA NAD. identify catalytic step blocked phosphorylation, CD spectroscopy used revealed appearance decay charge transfer complex component E1 thiamine pyrophosphate enzymatic reaction. Phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex lowering affinity thiamine pyrophosphate preclude formation holo-E1 inhibits interaction pyruvate. Phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase, like dephosphorylated enzyme, reacts 2-hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate half active sites. presence deacylating agents (CoA dithiothreitol) sites reactive. conclusion drawn alternating functioning active centers preserved reductive acetylation acceptor substrates phospho-E1.
