 Melatonin kills inhibits proliferation different cancer cell types, associated increase decrease reactive oxygen species, respectively. Intracellular oxidants originate mainly oxidative metabolism, cancer cells frequently show alterations metabolic pathway, Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). Thus, hypothesized melatonin could also regulate differentially oxidative metabolism cells cytotoxic (Ewing sarcoma cells) cells inhibits proliferation (chondrosarcoma cells). Ewing sarcoma cells chondrosarcoma cells showed metabolic profile consistent aerobic glycolysis, i.e. increased glucose uptake, LDH activity, lactate production HIF-1alpha activation. Melatonin reversed Ewing sarcoma metabolic profile effect associated cytotoxicity. differential regulation metabolism melatonin could explain hormone harmless wide spectrum normal tumoral cells, kills specific tumor cell types.
