 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase purified 2,700-fold apparent homogeneity extracts bovine kidney mitochondria. kinase consists two subunits (alpha beta) molecular weights 48,000 (alpha) 45,000 (beta) estimated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kinase activity resides alpha subunit. alpha subunit sensitive proteolysis chymotrypsin, whereas beta subunit selectively modified trypsin. observations, together results peptide mapping, indicate two subunits distinctly different proteins. proposed beta subunit regulatory subunit.
