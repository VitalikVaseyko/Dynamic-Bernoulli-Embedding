 previously observed stronger effect knockout Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) murine body weight glucose homeostasis. Two experiments conducted determine hepatic lipid profiles key metabolic regulators correlated difference. SOD1(-/-) GPX1(-/-) mice respective wild-type (WT) littermates (n=6 7/group, male) fed Se-adequate Torula yeast-sucrose diet killed 6 months age collect liver samples. Experiment 1, fasted SOD1(-/-) mice displayed pyruvate intolerance 61% decrease (P<0.05) liver glycogen compared WT littermates. former lower (P<0.05) activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, total protein phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A, higher (P<0.05) activity glucokinase liver latter. contrast, hepatic concentrations total cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids increased 11 100% (P<0.05) SOD1(-/-) mice. Meanwhile, mice elevated (P<0.05) hepatic protein levels sterol-regulatory element binding proteins 1 2, p53 MAPK, total phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase alpha1 protein, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein phosphatase 2B. Experiment 2, GPX1(-/-) mice WT littermates compared, showed difference measures. conclusion, knockout SOD1, GPX1, led decreased liver glycogen storage synchronized pyruvate intolerance elevated hepatic lipid profiles adult mice. striking comparison possibly due unique impacts two knockouts intracellular tone H(2)O(2) key regulators liver gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, lipogenesis.
