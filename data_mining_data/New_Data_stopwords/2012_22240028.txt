 Many solid tumors show large variability glycolytic activity lactate accumulation, correlated different metastatic spread, radioresistance patient survival. investigate potential differences protein profiles underlying metabolic variances, highly glycolytic human ovarian cancer cell line OC316 investigated compared less glycolytic line IGROV-1. Extracellular acidification oxygen consumption analyzed extracellular flux analyzer. Glycolysis-associated proteins, including specific membrane transporters, quantified in-cell western analyses. Metabolic properties corresponding tumor xenografts assessed via induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging. Extracellular flux analyses revealed elevated bioenergetics OC316 cells. Hexokinase II, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 beta subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, well glucose transporter 1 monocarboxylate transporter 4, overexpressed cells compared IGROV-1. generating tumor xenografts SCID mice, cells maintained glycolytic behavior, i.e. OC316 showed higher lactate concentrations IGROV-1 tumors. summary, congruency protein profiles metabolic properties demonstrated human ovarian cancer lines investigated. Also, perpetuation glycolytic characteristics transition vitro vivo situation documented. model system could useful systematic studies therapeutic intervention manipulation tumor glycolysis associated pathways.
