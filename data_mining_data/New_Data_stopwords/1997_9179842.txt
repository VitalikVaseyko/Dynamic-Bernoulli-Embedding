 report purification characterization enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) Mycobacterium smegmatis. N-terminus enzyme blocked internal sequence showed approx. 70% homology enzymes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Escherichia coli. immobilization mycobacterial nucleoside diphosphate kinase Sepharose 4 B matrix passing total cell extract revealed four proteins (P70, P65, P60, P50, respectively) M(r) 70 kDa, 65 kDa, 60 kDa 50 kDa retained column. proteins M(r) 70 kDa 50 kDa modulated activity Ndk directing towards GTP synthesis, 60 kDa protein channelled specificity Ndk entirely towards CTP synthesis. 65 kDa protein modulated specificity Ndk directing entirely towards UTP synthesis. specificity mycobacterial proteins towards NTP synthesis retained complexed P. aeruginosa Ndk. demonstrate P70 protein pyruvate kinase four proteins forms complex Ndk alters substrate specificity. Given ubiquitous nature Ndk living cell role maintaining correct ratios intracellular nucleoside triphosphates, implications occurrence complexes discussed relation precursor pool cell wall biosynthesis well RNA/DNA synthesis.
