 Phosphorylation activation loop AGC kinases typically mediated PDK1. precise mechanism in-trans phosphorylation unknown; however, docking hydrophobic (HF) motif C-tail substrate kinase onto N-lobe PDK1 likely essential step. Using peptide array PKA identify PDK1-interacting sites, discovered second AGC-conserved motif C-tail interacts PDK1. Since motif [FD(X)(1-2)Y/F] lies active site tether region PKA contributes ATP binding, call Adenosine binding (Ade) motif. Ade motif conserved PDK1-interacting site Akt PRK2, predict PDK1-interacting site AGC kinases. PKA, HF motif recognized turn motif Ser338 phosphorylated, possibly serving phosphorylation "switch" regulates Ade HF motifs interact PDK1. results demonstrate extended AGC C-tail serves polyvalent element trans-regulates PDK1 catalysis. Modeling PKA C-tail onto PDK1 structure creates two chimeric sites; ATP binding pocket, completed Ade motif, C-helix, positioned HF motif. Together, demonstrate substrate-assisted catalysis involving two kinases co-evolved symbiotic partners. highly regulated turn motifs variable part AGC C-tail. Elucidating highly regulated cis trans functions AGC tail significant future challenge.
