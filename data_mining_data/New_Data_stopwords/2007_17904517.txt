 H(+)-F(O)F(1)-ATP synthase couples proton flow membrane portion, F(O), synthesis ATP headpiece, F(1). Upon reversal reaction enzyme functions proton pumping ATPase. Even simplest bacterial enzyme ATPase activity regulated several mechanisms, involving inhibition MgADP, conformational transitions epsilon subunit, activation protonmotive force. report Met23Lys mutation gamma subunit Rhodobacter capsulatus ATP synthase significantly impaired activation ATP hydrolysis protonmotive force. impairment mutant due faster enzyme deactivation particularly evident low ATP/ADP ratio. suggest electrostatic interaction introduced gammaLys23 DELSEED region subunit beta stabilized ADP-inhibited state enzyme hindering rotation subunit gamma rotation necessary activation.
