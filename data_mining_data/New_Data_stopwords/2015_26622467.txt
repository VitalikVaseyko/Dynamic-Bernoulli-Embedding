 aim present study investigate effect Huaier proliferation apoptosis MKN45 SGC7901 gastric cancer cell lines. MTT assay used measure effects Huaier growth cells, cell cycle distribution apoptosis levels analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blotting used assess levels proteins associated apoptotic pathway. found cell survival decreased increase concentration Huaier, apoptosis rates increased dose-dependent manner MKN45 SGC7901 cells. number cells G2/M phase Huaier-treated groups increased dose-dependent manner compared control group. Huaier inhibited phosphorylated- (p-)AKT1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 1, p-phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase dual-specificity protein phosphatase B-cell lymphoma 2 expression upregulated cleaved-caspase-9 expression dose-dependent manner. conclusion, Huaier strongly inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation inhibiting cyclin B1 expression, promoting G2/M-phase arrest modulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, induce gastric cancer cell apoptosis modulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway dose-dependent manner.
