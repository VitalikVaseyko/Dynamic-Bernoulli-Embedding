 Combining endurance strength training (concurrent training) may change adaptation compared single mode training. However, site interaction mechanisms unclear. investigated hypothesis molecular signaling mitochondrial biogenesis endurance exercise impaired resistance exercise. Ten healthy subjects performed either endurance exercise (E; 1-h cycling approximately 65% maximal oxygen uptake), endurance exercise followed resistance exercise (ER; 1-h cycling + 6 sets leg press 70-80% 1 repetition maximum) randomized cross-over design. Muscle biopsies obtained exercise (1 3 h postcycling). mRNA genes related mitochondrial biogenesis [(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1)alpha, PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC)] related coactivator) substrate regulation (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4) increased E ER, mRNA levels twofold higher ER (P < 0.01). Phosphorylation proteins involved signaling cascade protein synthesis [mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal S6 kinase 1, eukaryotic elongation factor 2] altered ER E. Moreover, ER induced larger increase mRNA genes associated positive mTOR signaling (cMyc Rheb). Phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Akt increased similarly 1 h postcycling (P < 0.01) types exercise. Contrary hypothesis, results demonstrate ER, performed E, amplifies adaptive signaling response mitochondrial biogenesis compared single-mode endurance exercise. mechanism may relate cross talk signaling pathways mediated mTOR. results suggest concurrent training may beneficial adaptation muscle oxidative capacity.
