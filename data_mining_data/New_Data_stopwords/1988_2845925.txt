 Purified chicken liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase phosphorylated either fructose 2,6-bis[2-32P]phosphate fructose 2-phosphoro[35S]thioate 6-phosphate. turnover thiophosphorylated enzyme intermediate well overall phosphatase reaction four times faster authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2-phosphorothioate 6-phosphate 10-100-fold less potent authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulating 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase, 10 times potent inhibiting fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. analogue twice effective authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulating pyruvate kinase trypanosomes.
