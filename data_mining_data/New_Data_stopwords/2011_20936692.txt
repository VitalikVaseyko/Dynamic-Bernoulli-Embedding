 Increasing evidence supports notion increased oxidative stress fundamental cause aging process neurodegenerative diseases. result, decline cognitive function generally associated brain aging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) highly reactive intermediates, modify proteins, nucleic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading neuronal damage. proteins major components biological systems play key roles variety cellular functions, oxidative damage proteins represents primary event observed aging age-related neurodegenerative disorders. present study, redox proteomics approach, identified mitochondrial oxidatively modified proteins function brain aging, specifically brain regions, cortex hippocampus, commonly affected aging process. brain regions examined, many identified proteins energy-related, pyruvate kinase, ATP synthase, aldolase, creatine kinase, alpha-enolase. alterations associated significant changes cytosolic mitochondrial redox status brain regions analyzed. finding line current literature postulating free radical damage decreased energy production characteristic hallmarks aging process. additon, results contribute identifying common pathological pathways involved aging neurodegenerative disease development.
