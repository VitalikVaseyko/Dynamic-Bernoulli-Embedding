 dynamic behaviour open futile cycle composed phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase investigated homogeneous reconstituted enzyme system two enzymes cooperate pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. kinetic cooperation phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase various types dynamic patterns generated. absence fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase oscillations occur. experimentally demonstrated, definite region maximum activities fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase sustained oscillations originate higher concentrations enzyme damped oscillations appear. increasing concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase damping strengthened. Finally, high concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase metabolites relax monotonously stationary states. observed oscillatory phenomena mainly caused antagonistic effects AMP kinetics phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.
