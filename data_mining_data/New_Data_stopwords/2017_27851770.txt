 previously demonstrated islet depolarization 70 mM KCl opens Cx36 hemichannels allows diffusion small metabolites cofactors beta-cell plasma membrane. investigated islet "permeabilized" model whether glycolytic citric acid cycle intermediates stimulate insulin secretion correlates ATP production (islet content plus extracellular nucleotide accumulation). Glycolytic intermediates (10 mM) stimulated insulin secretion ATP production similarly. However, showed differential sensitivities respiratory chain enzyme inhibitors. Pyruvate showed lower secretory capacity less ATP production phosphoenolpyruvate, implicating important role glycolytic generation ATP. ATP production glucose-6-phosphate sensitive pyruvate kinase inhibitor effectively suppressed phosphoenolpyruvate-induced secretory response islet ATP rise. Strong suppression insulin secretion ATP production induced glucose-6-phosphate caused 10 muM antimycin A, implicating important role glycerophosphate shuttle transferring reducing equivalents mitochondria. Five citric acid cycle intermediates investigated secretory ATP production capacity (succinate, fumarate, malate, isocitrate alpha-ketoglutarate 5 mM, together ADP and/or NADP+ feed NADPH re-oxidation cycles). magnitude secretory response similar among different mitochondrial metabolites alpha-ketoglutarate showed sustained second phase secretion. Gabaculine (1 mM, GABA-transaminase inhibitor) suppressed second phase secretion ATP-production stimulated alpha-ketoglutarate, supporting role GABA shuttle control glucose-induced insulin secretion. None citric acid intermediates essayed showed suppression insulin secretion ATP-production presence gabaculine. propose endogenous GABA metabolism "GABA-shunt" facilitates ATP production citric acid cycle optimal insulin secretion.
