 INTRODUCTION: Screening programs colorectal cancer (CRC) mainly based first-line fecal immunochemical test hemoglobin (FIT). Fecal M2-type pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) evaluated clinical settings showing promising results early CRC detection. However, impact fecal M2-PK assessment performance first-round CRC screening programs known. investigated whether fecal M2-PK alone combination FIT may improve CRC screening efficacy general population. MATERIALS METHODS: total 1027 asymptomatic subjects (median age 66 [59-74] years; females 504 [49.1%]), identified general practitioners' rosters, invited collection 2 fecal samples FIT M2-PK evaluation. Participants least positive one fecal test referred colonoscopy. Quality indicators screening performance calculated analyzed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Overall, 572 subjects underwent FIT M2-PK assessment (participation rate 55.7%): 93 participants showed positive results least one test (positivity rate 16.3%). 10 patients positive tests. Attendance rate colonoscopy 86.0% total 65 adenomas 7 cancers detected. Combined use FIT fecal M2-PK permitted identification 18 neoplasm (25%) without improving colonoscopy workload, deduced comparable number needed scope (P = 0.402). CONCLUSION: addition M2-PK testing FIT offers potential detect additional neoplasms either bleed bleed intermittently without reducing participation rate without increasing endoscopy workload.
