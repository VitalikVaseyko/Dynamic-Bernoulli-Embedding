 OBJECTIVE: compare response chondrocytes cartilage matrix injurious mechanical compression treatment interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), characterizing proteins lost medium cartilage explant culture. METHODS: Cartilage explants young bovine stifle joints treated 10 ng/ml IL-1beta 100 ng/ml TNFalpha subjected uniaxial, radially-unconfined injurious compression (50% strain; 100%/second strain rate) cultured 5 days. Pooled media subjected gel-based separation (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, data analyzed Spectrum Mill proteomics software, focusing protein identification, expression levels, matrix protein proteolysis. RESULTS: 250 proteins detected, including extracellular matrix (ECM) structural proteins, pericellular matrix proteins important cell-cell interactions, novel cartilage proteins CD109, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like, angiopoietin-like 7, adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1. IL-1beta TNFalpha caused increased release chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), CHI3L2, complement factor B, matrix metalloproteinase 3, ECM-1, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A3, clusterin. Injurious compression caused release intracellular proteins, including Grp58, Grp78, alpha4-actinin, pyruvate kinase, vimentin. Injurious compression also caused increased release evidence proteolysis type VI collagen subunits, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, fibronectin. CONCLUSION: Overload compression injury caused loss cartilage integrity, including matrix damage cell membrane disruption, likely occurred strain-induced mechanical disruption cells matrix. IL-1beta TNFalpha caused release proteins associated innate immune stress response chondrocytes, may play role host defense pathogens may protect cells stress-induced damage.
