 regulation gene expression glucokinase (GK) L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) rat liver investigated compared previously reported regulation lipogenic enzymes. Experiments conducted time courses responses diet quantity mRNA concentrations enzyme activities refeeding carbohydrate/protein diet (CP) food-deprived rats measured. effects dietary nutrients gene expression investigated rats refed either CP diet, carbohydrate diet without protein (C), protein diet without carbohydrate (P), carbohydrate/protein/corn oil diet (CPF). effects CPF diet gene expression insulin treatment diabetic rats also investigated. refeeding CP diet, GK mRNA concentration enzyme activity reached maximum levels 2 h 16-24 h, respectively, whereas L-PK peaked 16 h 48 h, respectively, similar timecourse lipogenic enzymes. Moreover, GK mRNA concentrations maximal rats fed 20% ad libitum diet intake, L-PK mRNA concentrations, like lipogenic enzyme mRNA, maximal rats fed approximately 50% ad libitum intake. GK mRNA concentrations significantly increased parallel increase plasma insulin glucose concentrations. GK L-PK mRNA enzyme levels rats fed C diet comparably induced levels fed CP diet. L-PK mRNA induction CP diet significantly reduced dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (CPF diet), whereas GK mRNA induction significantly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
