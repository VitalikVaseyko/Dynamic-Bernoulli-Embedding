 Native mass spectrometry (MS) becoming important integral part structural proteomics system biology research. approach holds great promise elucidating higher levels protein structure: primary quaternary. requires efficient use tandem MS, cornerstone MS-based approaches. work, advance two-step fragmentation approach, (pseudo)-MS(3), native protein complexes set constituent fragment ions. Using efficient desolvation approach quadrupole selection extended mass-to-charge (m/z) range, accomplished sequential dissociation large protein complexes, phosporylase B (194 kDa), pyruvate kinase (232 kDa), GroEL (801 kDa), highly charged monomers dissociated set multiply charged fragmentation products. Fragment ion signals acquired high resolution, high mass accuracy Orbitrap instrument enabled highly confident identifications precursor monomer subunits. developed approach expected enable characterization stoichiometry composition endogenous native protein complexes unprecedented level detail.
