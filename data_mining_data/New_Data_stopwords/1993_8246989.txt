 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene expression modulated hormonal nutritional conditions. previously shown glucose/insulin response element (GlRE) L-PK gene built around two noncanonical E boxes (element L4) cooperate closely contiguous binding site (element L3). present report identification proteins interact elements. L3 site binds hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4)- COUP/TF-related proteins. fibroblasts, overexpression HNF4 transactivates L-PK promoter. contrary, COUP/TF strongly inhibits active promoter hepatocytes. L4 site binds major late transcription factor (MLTF) vitro ex vivo; mutations suppress binding activity also inactivated GlRE function. Mutations transforming one two noncanonical E boxes element L4 consensus MLTF/USF binding sites strongly increase affinity MLTF/USF impair glucose responsiveness. However, merely ability bind MLTF/USF seem sufficient confer GlRE activity: elements one E box destroyed transformed consensus MLTF/USF sequence bind MLTF/USF efficiently confer high glucose responsiveness L-PK gene promoter. Consequently, full activity L-PK GlRE seems require cooperation two putative MLTF/USF binding sites located vicinity HNF4 binding site.
