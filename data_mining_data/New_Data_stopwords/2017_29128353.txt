 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progressive disease poses high risk severe liver damage. However, pathogenesis NASH still unclear. Accumulation lipid droplets insulin resistance hallmark NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role glucose metabolism via regulating activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, demonstrated novel PDK4 NASH regulating hepatic steatosis insulin signaling pathway methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels highly induced human patients NASH MCD diet fed mice, well hepatocytes treated oleic acid. glucose lipid metabolism impaired Pdk4(-/-) mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated hepatic steatosis significantly NASH mice. Pdk4(-/-)-MCD mice reduced liver weights triglyceride (TG) levels. Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced expression genes related fatty acid uptake, synthesis gluconeogenesis. addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins observed. conclusion, data indicated PDK4 potentially contributes hepatic steatosis NASH via regulating several signaling pathway PDK4 may new therapeutic strategy NAFLD.
