 Two isoforms sphingosine kinase, SK1 SK2, catalyze formation bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) mammalian cells. previously shown treatment androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells non-selective SK isoform inhibitor, 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi), induces proteasomal degradation SK1. concomitant significant increase C22:0-ceramide sphingosine levels reduction S1P levels, resulting apoptosis LNCaP cells. contrast, show SK2-selective inhibitor, (R)-FTY720 methyl ether (ROME), increases sphingosine decreases S1P levels effect ceramide levels induce apoptosis LNCaP cells. also show several glycolytic metabolites (R)-S-lactoylglutathione increased upon treatment LNCaP cells SKi, induces proteasomal degradation c-Myc. changes reflect indirect antagonism Warburg effect. LNCaP cells also respond SKi diverting glucose 6-phosphate pentose phosphate pathway provide NADPH, serves antioxidant counter oxidative stress response. SKi also promotes formation novel pro-apoptotic molecule called diadenosine 5',5'''-P(1),P(3)-triphosphate (Ap3A), binds tumor suppressor fragile histidine triad protein (FHIT). contrast, SK2-selective inhibitor, ROME, induces reduction glycolytic metabolites affect oxidative stress. conclude SK1 functions increase stability c-Myc suppresses Ap3A formation, might maintain Warburg effect cell survival, SK2 exhibits non-overlapping function.
