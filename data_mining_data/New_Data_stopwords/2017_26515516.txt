 OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) associated decreased supply crucial substrates fetus affects growth development temporarily permanently modifying gene expression function. However, neonates born calorie restricted mothers IUGR reports regarding brain protein expression vis-a-vis IUGR siblings. Here, investigated expression key proteins regulate growth development brain non-IUGR newborn pups versus IUGR siblings control pups. METHODS: Rat brain proteins isolated group upon delivery separated two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). RESULTS: 14-3-3 Protein, calreticulin, elongation factor, alpha-enolase, fascin, heat-shock protein HSP90 pyruvate kinase isozymes significantly increased (p < 0.05) samples obtained IUGR newborn pups compared non-IUGR. Conversely, collapsin response mediator proteins, heat-shock70 peroxiredoxin2 decreased IUGR group compared non-IUGR. CONCLUSIONS: experimental study, IUGR pups showed altered proteomic profile compared non-IUGR siblings non-IUGR controls. Thus, offspring calorie-restricted mothers become IUGR accompanying alterations expression proteins. differentially expressed proteins could modulate alterations energy balance, plasticity maturation brain.
