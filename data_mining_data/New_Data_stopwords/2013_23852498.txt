 Cells solid tumors generate extracellular acidosis due Warburg effect tissue hypoxia. Acidosis affect functional behavior tumor cells, causing, e.g., multidrug resistance. process ERK1/2 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) seem play key role. However, underlying mechanism MAPK activation extracellular acidosis remains unclear. Experiments performed three tumor three normal tissue cell lines cells exposed extracellular pH 6.6 3 h. Intracellular pH (pHi), protein expression activation, acidosis-induced transactivation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation measured. Extracellular acidosis resulted rapid sustained decrease pHi leading reversal extra-/intracellular pH gradient. Extracellular acidosis led p38 phosphorylation cell types ERK1/2 phosphorylation three six cell lines. Furthermore, p38 phosphorylation also observed sole intracellular lactacidosis normal pHe. Acidosis-enhanced formation ROS, probably originating mitochondria, seems trigger MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, acidosis increased phosphorylation transcription factor CREB resulted increased transcriptional activity. Thus, acidic tumor microenvironment induce longer-lasting p38 CREB-mediated change transcriptional program.
