 K+ dependence assumed feature pyruvate kinases discovered enzymes express K+ -independent activity. Almost K+ -independent pyruvate kinases Lys position 117, instead Glu present K+ -dependent muscle enzyme. Mutagenesis studies show internal positive charge substitutes K+ requirement (Laughlin, L. T. & Reed, G. H. (1997) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 348, 262-267). work phylogenetic analysis pyruvate kinase performed ascertain abundance K+ -independent activities explore whether K+ activating effect related evolutionary history enzyme. 230 studied sequences, 46% Lys position 117, rest Glu. Pyruvate kinases Lys117 Glu117 separated two clusters. enzymes Glu117 cluster characterized K+ -dependent, whereas Lys117 cluster K+ -independent. Thus, strict correlation dichotomy tree dependence activity K+. 77% pyruvate kinases possess Lys117 Lys113/Gln114; also Ile, Val, Leu position 120. residues replaced Glu117 Thr113/Lys114/Thr120 80% K+ -dependent pyruvate kinases. Structural analysis indicates residues hinge region involved acquisition catalytic conformation enzyme. route conversion K+ -independent K+ -dependent pyruvate kinases described. plausible explanation enzymes developed K+ dependence put forth.
