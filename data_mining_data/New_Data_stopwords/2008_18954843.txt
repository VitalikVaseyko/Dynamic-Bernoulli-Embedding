 OBJECTIVE: study objective define muscle metabolic cardiovascular changes surgical intervention clinically severe obese patients. METHODS: Obesity state metabolic dysregulation lead maladaptive changes heart skeletal muscle, including insulin resistance heart failure. prospective longitudinal study, 43 consecutive patients underwent metabolic profiling, skeletal muscle biopsies, resting echocardiograms baseline 3 9 months bariatric surgery. RESULTS: Body mass index decreased (mean changes, 95% confidence interval [CI]): 7.7 kg/m(2) (95% CI, 6.70-8.89) 3 months 5.6 kg/m(2) (95% CI, 4.45-6.80; P<.0001) 9 months surgery, restoration insulin sensitivity decreases plasma leptin time points. Concurrent changes dramatic decreases skeletal muscle transcript levels stearoyl coenzyme-A desaturase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 3 9 months (P<.0001, both) significant decrease peroxisome proliferation activated receptor-alpha-regulated genes 9 months. Left ventricular relaxation impairment, assessed tissue Doppler imaging, normalized 9 months surgery. CONCLUSION: Weight loss results reversal systemic muscle metabolic derangements accompanied normalization left ventricular diastolic function.
