 Carbonic anhydrase (CAH) localized mitochondria-rich cells (MRC) 1-week-old salamander larvae gill epithelium, MRC pavement cells 6-week-old larvae, regenerated stems previously amputated gills. CAH activity MRC measured quantitatively using microscope densitometric technique. Changes CAH activity per cell changes numbers CAH-positive MRC followed different H+ Na+ concentrations two age groups. CAH activity per cell increased age, whereas numbers CAH-positive MRC dropped. CAH activity per cell 1-week-old age group reached maximal values pH 7.4 stayed relatively high alkaline media. Moderate increases Na+ concentrations small significant effects increasing CAH activity gill MRC. taking consideration changes cellular activity also changes number CAH-positive cells different acclimation media, activity index (ICAH) calculated. Thus, ICAH 1-week-old found dependent decline ambient H+ concentrations (expressed increasing pH), reaching maximal effect pH 8.0. hand, raising Na+ concentrations acclimation media 110 220 mOsm/liter caused maximal inhibition tissue CAH activity expressed ICAH. conclusion, suggested salamander larvae gill MRC take part adaptation larvae changing H+ concentrations milieu rather adaptation changes osmolality.
