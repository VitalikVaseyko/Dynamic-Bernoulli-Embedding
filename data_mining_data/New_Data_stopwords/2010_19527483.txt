 AIM: investigate effects globular adiponectin (gAd) gene expression whether effects mediated 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-activated protein kinase skeletal muscle myotubes obtained lean, obese obese diabetic individuals. METHODS: Rectus abdominus muscle biopsies obtained surgical patients establish primary skeletal muscle cell cultures. Three distinct primary cell culture groups established (lean, obese obese diabetic; n = 7 group). differentiated, cultures exposed gAd 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) 6 h. RESULTS: Stimulation gAd decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene expression obese diabetic samples (p < = 0.05) increased cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4 (COXIV) gene expression myotubes derived lean individuals (p < 0.05). AICAR treatment also decreased PDK4 gene expression obese- diabetic-derived myotubes (p < = 0.05) increased gene expression mitochondrial gene, COXIII, lean-derived samples (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: study demonstrated distinct disparity myotubes derived lean compared obese obese diabetic individuals following gAd AICAR treatment. understanding regulation PDK4 obese diabetic skeletal muscle interaction adiponectin signalling required appears important early molecular event disease states may improve blood glucose control metabolic flux.
