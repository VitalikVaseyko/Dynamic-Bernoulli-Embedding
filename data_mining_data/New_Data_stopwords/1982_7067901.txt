 1. Acute administration morphine foetuses neonates either directly via mother leads decrease total pyruvate kinase activity. 2. L-type isoenzyme selectively suppressed M-type isoenzyme altered significant extent consequent lowering L/M ratio. 3. decrease total pyruvate kinase activity L/M ratio prominent route administration morphine via mother. 4. possible explanation difference route administration morphine converted active metabolite greater biological potency adult animals.
