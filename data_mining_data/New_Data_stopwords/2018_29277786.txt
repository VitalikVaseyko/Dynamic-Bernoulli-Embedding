 BACKGROUND/AIM: shown many studies expression pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme plays key role cellular metabolism. evidence cancer cells manifesting dynamic proliferation may control division various mechanisms, i.a. expression PKM2 isoform. exact role PKM2 ovarian cancer (OC) cells cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) elucidated. MATERIALS METHODS: present study focused analysis PKM2 expression cancer cells CAFs 97 OC cases, mostly serous histological type. Moreover, relationships expression PKM2 proliferation (Ki-67; MCM-2, -3, -7; cyclin D1), vascular (CD31, D2-40) mesenchymal (Vim alphaSMA) markers well receptors (ER, PR, HER2, EGFR) examined. observations evaluated regard available clinicopathological data. RESULTS: expression PKM2 disclosed cytoplasm OC cells. statistically significant correlation PKM2 tested markers found. regard available clinicopathological data increasing trend PKM2 expression increasing grade histological malignancy G found (p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Due achieved results concerning expression PKM2 lack evidence diagnostic prognostic usage OC.
