 Gel filtration chromatography (GFC) separates molecules according size one widely used methods protein purification. Here, red fluorescent protein (RFP), green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), and/or fusion proteins prokaryotically expressed, purified, used laboratory exercise intuitively demonstrate GFC. Different bands, corresponding RFP, RFP-CFP (RC), YFP-RFP-YFP (YRY), pyruvate kinase II-GFP (PKG) well separated Superdex 200 column 0.5-mL sample. Increasing sample volume changing chromatographic resin Sephadex G-100 resulted lower resolution separation. Students enjoyed identifying combinations colored proteins found exercise helpful understanding factors affect GFC resolution.
