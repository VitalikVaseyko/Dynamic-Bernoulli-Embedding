 Exogenous endogenously generated reduced pyridine nucleotides caused marked stimulation O(2) uptake added treponemal cell-free extracts, indicated terminal electron transport coupled consumption O(2). Oxidation reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) shown correlate stoichiometrically O(2) reduction, suggesting NADH oxidized mainstream respiratory chain dehydrogenase. Oxygen evolution treponemal extracts observed completion O(2) uptake stimulated exogenous NADH endogenously generated reduced NAD phosphate. Oxygen evolution inhibited cyanide pyruvate, consistent O(2) release H(2)O(2) catalase. addition exogenous H(2)O(2) treponemal extracts caused rapid O(2) evolution characteristic catalase reaction. spectrophotometric assay used measure ATP formation T. pallidum cell-free extracts stimulated NADH. P/O ratios 0.5 1.1 calculated amounts ATP formed versus NADH oxidized. Phosphorylating activity dependent P(i) concentration sensitive cyanide, N, N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. Adenine nucleotide pools T. pallidum measured firefly luciferin-luciferase assay. Shifts adenine nucleotide levels upon addition NADH cell-free extracts impossible evaluate due presence NAD(+) nucleosidase. However, whole cells, previously incubated atmosphere 95% N(2)-5% CO(2), sparged air, ATP ADP levels increased, AMP levels decreased. shift attributed oxidative phosphorylation presence adenylate kinase activity. T. pallidum also found possess Mg(2+) - Ca(2+) -stimulated ATPase activity sensitive N, N' -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. data indicated capability oxidative phosphorylation T. pallidum.
