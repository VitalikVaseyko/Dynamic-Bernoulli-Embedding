 Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers derived proteolytic cleavage amyloid-beta protein precursor impair memory hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) vivo vitro. recognized primary neurotoxic agents Alzheimer's disease. Pyruvate protective effect Abeta-induced neuronal cell death hippocampal slice cultures. However, whether pyruvate also protective effect inhibition neuronal plasticity induced Abeta remains elucidated. study examined effect pyruvate Abeta-induced inhibition LTP rat hippocampus. found pyruvate prevented Abeta-induced inhibition LTP strong fostriecin, specific protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor. Pyruvate prevented Abeta block Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) autophosphorylation Abeta-induced PP2A activation. Pyruvate, lactate, decreased reactive oxygen species levels CA1 slices exposed Abeta. propose pyruvate could prevent Abeta-induced inhibition LTP re-autophosphorylation CaMK2 PP2A inactivation. reduction reactive oxygen species production considered upstream mechanism observed pyruvate protection.
