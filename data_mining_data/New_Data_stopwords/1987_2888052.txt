 DNA studies (restriction fragment length polymorphism linkage analysis deletion analysis pERT87) serum creatine kinase/pyruvate kinase (CK/PK) measurements done determine carrier status 59 mothers sisters isolated Duchenne dystrophy (DD) cases. results DNA studies modified carrier risks 34 59 (58%), derived risks often differ importantly risks calculated conventional methods. Elevated CK/PK provided strong evidence carrier state 24 59 (41%), CK/PK frequently provided data unavailable DNA studies. Serum enzyme determinations remain important means evaluating DD carrier suspects especially valuable isolated-case families. Enzyme testing combined DNA studies achieve best estimate carrier risk.
