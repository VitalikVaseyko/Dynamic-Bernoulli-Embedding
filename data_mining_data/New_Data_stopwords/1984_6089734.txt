 effect dietary hormonal variations specific activities hexokinase isoenzymes, N-acetylglucosamine kinase pyruvate kinase isoenzymes parenchymal non-parenchymal liver cells studied. Hexokinase markedly decreased hepatocytes animals fasted fed carbohydrate-free diet well diabetic rats, attaining constant low level 17% normal values. Pyruvate kinase L also diminished hepatocytes experimental conditions. contrast, three high-affinity hexokinase isoenzymes A, B C remained without variation total amount relative proportions hepatocytes non-parenchymal liver cells isolated animals various conditions studied. N-Acetylglucosamine kinase activities also change either parenchymal non-parenchymal liver cells conditions. results discussed relation significance N-acetylglucosamine kinase various hexokinase isoenzymes phosphorylation glucose dietary hormonal manipulations.
