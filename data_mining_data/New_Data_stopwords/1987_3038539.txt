 L-type pyruvate kinase enzyme glycolytic pathway whose activity mRNA levels fluctuate small intestine according dietary status. enzyme activity mRNA concentration decline fasting increase upon refeeding either glucose-rich fructose-rich diet. Using single-strand 13 phage complementary L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA probe, determined level mRNA small intestine normal, adrenalectomized, thyroidectomized, diabetic glucagon-treated cAMP-treated animals refed either glucose-rich fructose-rich diet. specific mRNA present small intestine normal fasted rats increases twofold threefold refeeding glucose fructose respectively. However, hormonal control gene expression differs according dietary carbohydrate. L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA increase, induced glucose feeding, hormone-dependent requires presence thyroid hormones insulin. fructose-fed rats certain level mRNA increase occurs regardless hormonal status animals, full induction mRNA fructose requires presence glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones insulin. Thus, hormonal regulation L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression small intestine largely similar described normal rat liver basal mRNA level stimulation mRNA increase fructose higher small intestine.
