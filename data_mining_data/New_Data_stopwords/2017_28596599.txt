 Warburg effect metabolic hallmark cancer. Tumor cells rapidly adjust energy source glycolysis order efficiently proliferate hypoxic environment, mechanism underlying switch remains incompletely understood. Here, show hypoxia potently induces down-regulation miR-125a expression hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells tumors. Furthermore, demonstrate miR-125a could decrease production lactate, uptake glucose, levels ATP reactive oxygen species (ROS) HCC cells. investigated molecular mechanism miR-125a inhibits HCC glycolysis identified hexokinase II (HK2) direct target gene miR-125a. Finally, revealed miR-125a/HK2 axis functionally important regulating glycolysis HCC cell progression cancer vitro vivo. summary, findings demonstrate first time hypoxia-down-regulated miR-125a regulated HCC glycolysis carcinogenesis targeting hexokinase HK2, key glycolytic enzyme Warburg effect, add new dimension hypoxia-mediated regulation cancer metabolism.
