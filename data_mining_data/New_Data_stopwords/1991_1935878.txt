 electrode configuration described allows fast isoelectric focusing (IEF) conventional IEF systems. equipment, fixed cooling plate conventional IEF system, consists base plate flappable electrode holders fastened. handling simple needs little time. Graphite rods used electrodes, thus avoiding use buffer strips. Samples applied special applicator strips--permitting analysis 19 samples 50 x 40 mm polyacrylamide gel 44 samples 100 x 70 mm gel. 30 min needed one IEF run.
