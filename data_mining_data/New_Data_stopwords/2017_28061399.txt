 Transcriptome sequencing annotation performed Haematococcus pluvialis mutant red cells induced high light 15% CO2 demonstrate astaxanthin yield mutant 1.7 times higher wild strain. found 56% 1947 differentially expressed genes upregulated mutant cells. significant differences found unigenes related photosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. pyruvate kinase increased 3.5-fold mutant cells. Thus, pyruvate, beneficial carotenoids fatty acid biosynthesis, generated. Phytoene synthase, zeta-carotene desaturase, lycopene beta-cyclase involved beta-carotene biosynthesis mutant cells upregulated 10.4-, 4.4-, 5.8-fold, respectively. Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase catalyzing conversion beta-carotene astaxanthin upregulated 18.4-fold. fatty acid biosynthesis promoted upregulation acetyl-CoA synthetase acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus increasing astaxanthin esterification accumulation mutant cells.
