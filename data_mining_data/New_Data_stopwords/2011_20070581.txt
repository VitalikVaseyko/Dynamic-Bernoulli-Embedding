 study carried evaluate usefulness pre-maturation step improving coordination cytoplasmic nuclear maturation horse compact cumulus oocytes addition roscovitine (ROSC). Oocytes collected scraping pre-cultured 18 h maturation medium TCM199 supplemented pyruvate, LH, FSH, insulin growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, transferrin selenium (IVM-ROSC) simple medium (M199-ROSC). pre-maturation, oocytes groups part denuded fixed-stained part vitro matured assess kinetic vitro maturation (IVM). nuclear progression cytoskeletal organization microfilaments cortical granules (CG) treated untreated oocytes assessed fluorescent probes. Oocytes immediately fixed recovery oocytes pre-cultured M199-ROSC 18 h show metaphase II (MII) plates, whereas IVM-ROSC group, 6/69 oocytes (8.7%) showed MII plates. inhibition, maturation kinetics 11, 18 29 h, maturation rate M199-ROSC group progressively increased 29 h IVM, reached maturation rate control group (13/66, 19.7% vs 31/125, 24.8%). statistically significant differences cytoplasmic maturation found. number MII plates 29 h IVM, significantly higher (p < 0.05) IVM-ROSC group (34/90) compared M199-ROSC (13/66) control groups (31/125) well number oocytes microfilaments CG distributed cortical region (25/34 vs 3/13 7/31 respectively). results showed pre-culturing presence Roscovitine fully supplemented maturation medium containing gonadotropins growth factors partially suppressed meiotic maturation, established suitable environment improving cytoplasmic maturation horse compact cumulus oocytes defined microfilaments CG configuration.
