 Antibodies Brassica napus cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) (EC 2.7.1.40) employed examine PKc subunit composition developmental profiles castor soybean seeds. 56-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide uniformly detected immunoblots clarified extracts developing castor endosperm soybean embryos. Maximal PKc activities occurred early castor oil seed (COS) soybean development (7.1 5.5 (micromol pyruvate produced/min) g(-1) FW, respectively) 25-fold greater fully mature seeds. Time-course studies revealed close correlation extractable PKc activity relative amount immunoreactive 56-kDa PKc polypeptide. PKc developing COS purified 1,874-fold homogeneity final specific activity 73.1 (micromol pyruvate produced/min) mg(-1) protein. Gel filtration SDS-PAGE indicated PKc exists 230-kDa homotetramer composed 56-kDa subunits. mass fingerprint tryptic peptides 56-kDa COS PKc subunit best matched three putative PK(c)s Arabidopsis thaliana. purified enzyme relatively heat-stable displayed broad pH optimum 6.4. However, efficient substrate utilization (in terms Vmax /Km phosphoenolpyruvate ADP) observed pH 7.4. Glutamate effective inhibitor, whereas aspartate functioned activator partially relieving glutamate inhibition. Together previous studies, results: (1) allow model formulated regarding coordinate allosteric control PKc phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase aspartate glutamate developing COS, (2) provide biochemical evidence castor plant PKc exists tissue-specific isozymes exhibit substantial differences respective physical regulatory properties.
