 C4 plants, pyruvate phosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP) regulates C4-pathway enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) response changes incident light-intensity. maize (Zea mays) leaves, two distinct isoforms PDRP expressed, ZmPDRP1 ZmPDRP2. properties C4-function ZmPDRP1 isoform well understood. However, PDRP2 isoform recently identified properties function(s) maize leaves unknown. therefore initiated investigation maize PDRP2 isoform performing side-by-side comparison enzyme properties cell-specific distribution PDRP1. terms enzyme functionality, PDRP2 found possess protein kinase specific-activity PDRP1. However, PDRP2 isoform found lack phosphotransferase activity bifunctional PDRP1 isoform except PDRP2 assays elevated 5- 10-fold. primarily immuno-based approach used show PDRP1 strictly expressed mesophyll-cells PDRP2 strictly expressed bundle-sheath strand cells (BSC). Additionally, using situ immunolocalization, establish regulatory target PDRP2 showing significant presence C4-PPDK BSC chloroplasts. However, metabolic role PPDK compartment obscure assuming PPDK accumulating compartment would irreversibly inactivated dark cycle monofunctional PDRP2.
