 studied metabolism xylose Candida tropicalis oxygen-limited chemostat. vitro enzyme assays indicated glycolytic gluconeogenetic enzymes expressed simultaneously facilitating substrate cycling. Enhancing redox imbalance cofeeding formate increased xylose oxygen consumption rates ethanol, xylitol, glycerol CO2 production rates steady state. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) indicated fructose 6-phosphate replenished pentose phosphate pathway sufficient amounts without contribution gluconeogenetic pathway. Substrate cycling pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase phospho-enol-pyruvate kinase increased ATP turnover. Cofeeding formate increased ATP yield. ATP yields xylose xylose-formate cultivation 6.9 8.7 mol ATP/C-mol CDW, respectively, calculated MFA.
