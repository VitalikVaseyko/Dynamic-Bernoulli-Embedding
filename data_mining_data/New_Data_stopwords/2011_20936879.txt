 Brown planthopper (BPH) notorious pest rice plants attacking leaf sheaths seriously affecting global rice production. However, rice plants respond BPH remains fully understood. understand systems metabolic responses rice plants BPH infestation, analyzed BPH-induced metabolic changes leaf sheaths BPH-susceptible resistant rice varieties using NMR-based metabonomics measured expression changes 10 relevant genes using quantitative real-time PCR. results showed rice metabonome dominated 30 metabolites including sugars, organic acids, amino acids, choline metabolites. BPH infestation caused profound metabolic changes BPH-susceptible resistant rice plants involving transamination, GABA shunt, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis/glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, secondary metabolisms. BPH infestation caused drastic overall metabolic changes BPH-susceptible variety marked up-regulations key genes regulating GABA shunt biosynthesis secondary metabolites BPH-resistant variety. observations indicated activation GABA shunt shikimate-mediated secondary metabolisms vital rice plants resist BPH infestation. findings filled gap understandings mechanistic aspects BPH resistance rice plants demonstrated combined metabonomic qRT-PCR analysis effective approach understanding plant-herbivore interactions.
