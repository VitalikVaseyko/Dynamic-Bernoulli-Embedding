 M2 form pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) purified human leucocytes new method involving succession two different Dyematrex agarose chromatographies. main step consisted orange dye affinity column elution fructose-1,6-diphosphate. purification procedure allowed us obtain M2-PK specific activity 433 I.U./mg protein, i.e. 188-fold purification overall yield 33%. homogeneity preparation verified sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis double immunodiffusion Ouchterlony plates. Anti-M2-PK antibodies obtained rabbit neutralized enzyme activity. specificity regard types PK showed anti-M2-PK also reacted M1-PK R-PK.
