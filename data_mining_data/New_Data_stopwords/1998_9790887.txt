 Earlier attempts purify characterize nonrecombinant pyruvate kinase Schizosaccharomyces pombe proved difficult due problems associated instability protein. enzyme overexpressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH22, permitting studies determine conditions required stabilize enzyme purification. Recombinant S. pombe pyruvate kinase purified combination ion-exchange chromatography gel filtration. purified enzyme showed sigmoidal kinetics respect PEP; presence FBP, kinetics restored Michaelis-Menten behavior. respect ADP, Hill coefficient affected FBP. Determination molecular mass purified enzyme ultracentrifugation showed behaved dimer-tetramer system Kd approximately 1 microM.
