 Genomic clones containing human pyruvate kinase (PKM) gene, encodes M1-type M2-type isozymes, isolated exon sequences determined. gene approximately 32 kb consists 12 exons 11 introns. Exons 9 10 contain sequences specific M1 M2 types, respectively, indicating human isozymes produced gene alternative splicing case rat gene. exon-intron structure human PKM gene identical rat gene, introns genes interrupt exons points. Introns 6 7 begin GC dinucleotide instead consensus GT, exon-intron boundaries consistent GT-AG rule. gene transcribed multiple start sites. 5'-flanking region gene contains putative Sp1-binding sites, TATA box CAAT box, shows high sequence similarity rat gene. Bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed upstream region positions -493 -51 contained cis-acting element(s) essential expression gene HeLa cells. Long stretches conserved regions found introns around M1-specific M2-specific exons, suggesting regions may involved alternative splicing machinery.
