 carbon storage regulator gene csrA shown previously dramatically affect biosynthesis intracellular glycogen Escherichia coli negative control expression two glycogen biosynthetic operons gluconeogenic gene pckA (Romeo, T., Gong, M., Liu, M. Y., Brun-Zinkernagel, A. M. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 4744-4755). Examination effects csrA several enzymes, genes, metabolites central carbohydrate metabolism establishes extensive role csrA directing intracellular carbon flux. Phosphoglucomutase gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase found negative control csrA, enzyme activities maximal early stationary phase growth. enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triose-phosphate isomerase, enolase positively regulated csrA. Thus, csrA exerts reciprocal effects glycolysis versus gluconeogenesis glycogen biosynthesis. glycolytic isozymes pyruvate kinase F (encoded pykF pykA, respectively) phosphofructokinase II (pfkA pfkB, respectively) exhibited differential regulation via csrA. Since individual members isozyme pairs allosterically regulated different cellular metabolites, csrA also capable fine-tuning allosteric regulation glycolysis. contrast, expression genes pentose phosphate pathway weakly negligibly affected csrA.
