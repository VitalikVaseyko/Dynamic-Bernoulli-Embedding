 BACKGROUND: High-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) implicated tumorigenesis various cancers. However, clinical significance HMGB2 signaling human breast cancer progression remains unknown. METHODS: investigated HMGB2 expression 185 cases primary breast cancer matched normal breast tissue specimens, explored underlying mechanisms altered HMGB2 expression well impact altered expression breast cancer growth aerobic glycolysis using vitro animal models breast cancer. RESULTS: HMGB2 highly expressed tumor-cell nuclei breast cancer cells adjacent normal breast tissues (P < 0.05). Higher HMGB2 expression correlated larger tumor size (P = 0.003) advanced tumor stage (P = 0.033). Cox proportional hazards model revealed HMGB2 expression independent prognostic factor breast cancer radical resection (P < 0.05). Experimentally, knockdown HMGB2 expression stable transfected shRNA significantly decreased growth glycolysis breast cancer cells vitro mouse models. Mechanically, promotion breast cancer progression HMGB2 directly significantly correlated activation LDHB expression inactivation FBP1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: results disclose novel role HMGB2 reprogramming metabolic process breast cancer cells targeting LDHB FBP1 provide potential prognostic predictors breast cancer patients.
