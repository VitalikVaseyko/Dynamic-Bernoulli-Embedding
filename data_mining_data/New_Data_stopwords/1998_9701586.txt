 investigate short-term effect elevated temperatures carbon metabolism growing potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers, developing tubers exposed range temperatures 19 degreesC 37 degreesC. Incorporation [14C]glucose (Glc) starch showed temperature optimum 25 degreesC. Increasing temperature 23 degreesC 25 degreesC 37 degreesC led decreased labeling starch, increased labeling sucrose (Suc) intermediates respiratory pathway, increased respiration rates. elevated temperatures, hexose-phosphate levels increased, whereas levels glycerate-3-phosphate (3PGA) phosphoenolpyruvate decreased. increase pyruvate malate, decrease isocitrate. amount adenine diphosphoglucose (ADPGlc) decreased tubers exposed elevated temperatures. strong correlation vivo levels 3PGA ADPGlc tubers incubated different temperatures, decrease ADPGlc correlated well decrease labeling starch. tubers incubated temperatures 30 degreesC, overall activities Suc synthase ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase declined slightly, whereas soluble starch synthase pyruvate kinase remained unchanged. Elevated temperatures led activation Suc phosphate synthase involving change kinetic properties. strong correlation Suc phosphate synthase activation vivo level Glc-6-phosphate. proposed elevated temperatures lead increased rates respiration, resulting decline 3PGA inhibits ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase starch synthesis.
