 PKCdelta emerged novel regulatory molecule oxidative phosphorylation targeting pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). showed activation PKCdelta leads dephosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), thereby decreasing PDK2 activity increasing PDH activity, accelerating oxygen consumption, augmenting ATP synthesis. However, molecular components mediate PKCdelta signaling mitochondria remained elusive far. Here, identify first time functional complex, includes cytochrome c upstream driver PKCdelta, uses adapter protein p66Shc platform vitamin (retinol) fourth partner. four components necessary activation PKCdelta signal chain. Genetic ablation one three proteins, retinol depletion, silences signaling. Furthermore, mutations disrupt interaction cytochrome c p66Shc, p66Shc PKCdelta, deletion retinol-binding pocket PKCdelta, attenuate signaling. cytochrome c-deficient cells, reintroduction cytochrome c Fe(3+) protein restores PKCdelta signaling. Taken together, results indicate oxidation PKCdelta key activation pathway. PKCdelta/p66Shc/cytochrome c signalosome might evolved effect site-directed oxidation zinc-finger structures PKCdelta, harbor activation centers vitamin binding sites. findings define molecular mechanisms underlying signaling function PKCdelta mitochondria.
