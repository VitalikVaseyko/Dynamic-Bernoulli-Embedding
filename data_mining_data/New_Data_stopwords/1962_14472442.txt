 Meloche, H. P., Jr. (Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Ill.). Enzymatic utilization glucose basidiomycete. J. Bacteriol. 83:766-774. 1962.-Cell-free extracts acetone-dried Lactarius torminosus NRRL 2900 prepared. extracts contained hexokinase. also contained triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN)-specific glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzed reduction TPN presence d-fructose-6-phosphate, 6-phospho-d-gluconic acid (6PG), d-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P). Aged preparations oxidized d-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) 6PG, whereas fresh preparations oxidized G6P pentose uptake 1 mumole O(2) evolution 1 mumole CO(2) per mumole G6P. Evidence action transketolase metabolism R5P cell-free extracts obtained.Cell-free preparations lacked hexosediphosphate enzymes. Triosephosphate isomerase F6P kinase could demonstrated; however, aldolase activity present. Evidence presented conversion d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate pyruvate. addition, phosphohexoisomerase demonstrated. appears hexosemonophosphate pathway operates L. torminosus extracts may major mechanism glucose dissimilation organism.
