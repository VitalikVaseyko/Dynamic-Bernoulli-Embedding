 Escherichia coli K-12 mutants lacking adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated pyruvate kinase isolated accidentally used prepare mutants additionally devoid fructose bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase. double mutants totally devoid pyruvate kinase activity still grow well aerobic conditions sugars catabolized phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):sugar phosphotransferase system, grow poorly non-phosphotransferase system sugars. suggests although pyruvate kinase plays major role formation pyruvate PEP growth non-phosphotransferase system sugars, operation PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system contribute significantly pyruvate production PEP. absence pyruvate kinase active PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system methylglyoxal glycolytic bypass may also function extent formation pyruvate catabolism simple hexose sugars. unique physiological role yet ascribed adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated pyruvate kinase result studies.
