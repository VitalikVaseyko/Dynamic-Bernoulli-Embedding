 peripartal transition period dairy cattle often characterized inflammatory state that, controlled, could detrimental production, health, fertility. Approaches control postpartal degree inflammation include treatments nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) postcalving, improved cow production health. date, research NSAID conducted confinement cows reach milk production levels substantially greater pasture. Furthermore, little data available effect NSAID mRNA expression inflammation metabolism-related genes. Transcription regulation important mechanism inflammation metabolic control. present study conducted examine hepatic adipose tissue gene expression response injections NSAID, carprofen, 1, 3, 5 calving. Grazing Holstein-Friesian cows control group 1 treated carprofen first 5 postcalving used. Liver subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies harvested -1, 1, 2 wk relative parturition. 30 genes associated fatty acid oxidation, growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, hepatokines, lipoprotein metabolism, gluconeogenesis, inflammation analyzed. calving, data suggest tissues respond inflammation signals onset lactation. Administration NSAID led greater hepatic expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), helps regulate gluconeogenesis, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), important assembly secretion low-density lipoproteins. adipose tissue, NSAID administration resulted greater expression inflammation-related genes interleukin-1, beta (IL1B), interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5). data support role inflammation normal component homeorhetic adaptations lactation reveal possible mechanism action carprofen transition dairy cows, reflect effect NSAID extent peripartum inflammation.
