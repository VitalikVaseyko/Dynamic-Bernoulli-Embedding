 fermentative growth, Escherichia coli degrades carbohydrates via glycolytic route two pyruvate molecules. Pyruvate reduced lactate nonoxidatively cleaved pyruvate formate lyase acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) formate. Acetyl-CoA utilized energy conservation phosphotransacetylase (PTA) acetate kinase (ACK) reaction sequence serve acceptor reducing equivalents gathered pyruvate formation, action alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE). Formic acid strongly acidic redox potential -420 mV standard conditions therefore classified high-energy compound. disproportionation CO2 molecular hydrogen (Em,7 -420 mV) via formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) system therefore high selective value. FHL reaction involves participation least seven proteins, metalloenzymes, requirements iron, molybdenum, nickel, selenium. Complex auxiliary systems incorporate metals. Reutilization hydrogen evolved required evolution H2 oxidation systems, couple oxidation process appropriate energy-conserving terminal reductase. E. coli two hydrogen-oxidizing enzyme systems. Finally, fermentation "last resort" energy metabolism, since gives minimal energy yield compared respiratory processes. Consequently, fermentation used external electron acceptors absent. necessitated establishment regulatory cascades, ensure metabolic capability appropriately adjusted physiological condition. review genetics, biochemistry, regulation hydrogen metabolism hydrogenase maturation system.
