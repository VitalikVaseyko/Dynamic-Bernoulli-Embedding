 uptake 32P exogenous 32Pi membrane proteins sickle erythrocytes analyzed. phosphorylation spectrin normal sickle cells. is, however, substantial increase 32P sialoproteins membrane, demonstrated fractionation selective proteolysis. Normal sickle erythrocytes separated Stractan gradients average cell age determined using remaining pyruvate kinase activity marker. altered phosphorylation sickle cells seen young normal cells, suggesting related cell age. altered phosphorylation also correlated level reticulocytes fractions. result evidence abnormalities sialoproteins sickle erythrocytes first demonstration altered sialoprotein phosphorylation red cell.
