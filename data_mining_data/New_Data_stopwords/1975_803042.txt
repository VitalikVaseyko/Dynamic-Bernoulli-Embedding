 Seven enzymes Embden-Myerhof pathway glycolysis assayed hypotonically treated epididymal sperm mature rabbits. were: fructose-biphosphate aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. enzymes firmly enough bound cell structure resist removal washing hypotonic treatment maximal activities comparable to, greater than, rate mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, rapid oxygen uptake observed intermediates glycolytic pathway. activity lactate dehydrogenase typical preparation hypotonically treated cells 5.3 mumoles/minute x 10(9) cells 25 degrees C pyruvate reduction hypotonically treated cells 4.8 mumoles/minute x 10(9) cells thrice-washed hypotonically treated cells. Km pyruvate 1.4 mM lactate 4.4 mM. contrast, maximal activity pyruvate oxidation mitochondria 0.10 microgram atom oxygen/minute x 10(9) cells, corresponding 0.020 mumole pyruvate/minute x 10(9) cells, Km pyruvate 5 microM. enzyme parameters favor high lactate production glucose aerobic glycolysis.
