 Malignant gliomas (astrocytomas) lethal tumors invade brain. Invasive cell migration initiated extension pseudopodia interstitial spaces. study, U87 glioma cells formed pseudopodia vitro cells pushed 3 microm pores polycarbonate membranes. Harvesting pseudopodia novel two-step method provided material proteomic analysis. Differences protein profiles pseudopodia whole cells found using differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) immunoblotting. Proteins two-dimensional (2D) gels M(R)'s 20-100 kDa pI's 3.0-10.0 identified peptide mass fingerprinting analysis using mass spectrometry. DIGE, lysates pseudopodia whole cells labeled electrophilic forms fluorescent dyes, Cy3 Cy5, analyzed mixtures. Analysis repeated reciprocal labeling. Differences protein distributions detected manual inspection computer analysis. Topographical digital maps scanned gels used algorithmic spot matching, normalization background, quantifying spot differences, elimination artifacts. Pseudopodial proteins Coomassie-stained 2D gels included isoforms glycolytic enzymes largest group, seven 24 proteins. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis DIGE gels demonstrated increased isoforms annexin (Anx) I, AnxII, enolase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase, decreased mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase transketolase pseudopodia. Specific antibodies showed restricted immunoreactivity hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) alpha chain pseudopodia, indicating localization active form. Met (the HGF receptor), actin, total AnxI increased pseudopodial lysates immunoblots. Increased constituents pseudopodial proteome glioma cells, identified study actin, HGF, Met, isoforms AnxI, AnxII, several glycolytic enzymes, represent therapeutic targets consider suppression tumor invasion.
