 OBJECTIVE: Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) serves metabolic switch glucose fatty acid utilization. PDC activity inhibited PDC kinase (PDK). PDC shares substrate, i.e., pyruvate, glyceroneogenesis, pathway controlling fatty acid release white adipose tissue (WAT). Thiazolidinediones activate glyceroneogenesis. studied regulation rosiglitazone PDK2 PDK4 isoforms tested hypothesis glyceroneogenesis could controlled PDK. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: Rosiglitazone administered Zucker fa/fa rats, PDK4 PDK2 mRNAs examined subcutaneous, periepididymal, retroperitoneal WAT, liver, muscle real-time RT-PCR. Cultured WAT explants humans rats 3T3-F442A adipocytes rosiglitazone-treated analyses PDK2 PDK4 mRNA protein. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfected electroporation. Glyceroneogenesis determined using [1-(14)C]pyruvate incorporation lipids. RESULTS: Rosiglitazone increased PDK4 mRNA WAT depots liver muscle. PDK2 transcript affected. isoform selectivity also found ex vivo-treated explants. 3T3-F442A adipocytes, Pdk4 expression strongly selectively induced rosiglitazone direct transcriptional manner, concentration required half-maximal effect 1 nmol/l. use dichloroacetic acid leelamine, two PDK inhibitors, specific PDK4 siRNA demonstrated PDK4 participated glyceroneogenesis, therefore altering nonesterified fatty acid release basal rosiglitazone-activated conditions. CONCLUSIONS: data show PDK4 upregulation adipocytes participates hypolipidemic effect thiazolidinediones modulation glyceroneogenesis.
