 activity amount glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) muscle young dystrophic hamsters reduced approximately half level found control animals. changes brain liver enzyme activity found. Several glycolytic enzyme activities creatine kinase activity muscle unchanged, except modest decreases aldolase pyruvate kinase. assess synthesis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, poly(A)+ RNA isolated muscle polysomes dystrophic control animals activity assessed mRNA-dependent translation system. translatability mRNA GAPDH found dystrophic muscle preparations also half found control muscle preparations. Decreases also found translatability mRNA tropomyosin.
