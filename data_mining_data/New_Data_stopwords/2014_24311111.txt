 practice, usually multiple biomarkers measured subject disease diagnosis. Combining biomarkers single score could improve diagnostic accuracy. Many researchers addressed problem finding optimal linear combination based maximizing area ROC curve (AUC). Actually, combined score might less optimal property diagnostic threshold. paper, propose idea using Youden index objective function searching optimal linear combination. combined score directly achieves maximum overall correct classification rate diagnostic threshold corresponding Youden index; words, optimal linear combination score making disease diagnosis. present empirical numerical searching methods optimal linear combination. carry extensive simulation study investigate performance proposed methods. Additionally, empirically compare optimal overall classification rates proposed combination based Youden index traditional one based AUC demonstrate significant gain diagnostic accuracy proposed combination. end, apply proposed methods real data set.
