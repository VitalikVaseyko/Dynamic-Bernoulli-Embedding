 Biopsies 15 human gliomas, five meningiomas, four Schwannomas, one medulloblastoma, four normal brain areas analyzed 12 enzymes energy metabolism 12 related metabolites cofactors. Samples, 0.01-0.25 microgram dry weight, dissected freeze-dried microtome sections permit assays given specimen made, far possible, nonnecrotic pure tumor tissue region. Great diversity found regard enzyme activities metabolite levels among individual tumors, following generalities made. Activities hexokinase, phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase levels usually lower brain; glycogen synthase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase usually higher; averages pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase greatly different brain. Levels eight 12 enzymes distinctly lower among Schwannomas two groups. Average levels glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, uridine diphosphoglucose twice brain; 6-phosphogluconate citrate 70% higher brain; glucose, glycogen, glycerol-1-phosphate, malate averages ranged 104% 127% brain; fructose-1,6-bisphosphate glucose-1,6-bisphosphate levels average 50% 70% brain, respectively.
