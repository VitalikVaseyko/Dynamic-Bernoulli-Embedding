 Physical activity affect many aspects metabolism unclear extent relies manipulation energy balance. Twenty-six active men age 25 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD) randomly assigned either consume 50% energy normal over-consuming habitual diet 7 days whilst simultaneously restricting physical activity 4000 steps day(-1) induce energy surplus (SUR group; n = 14) regimen 45 min daily treadmill running 70% maximum oxygen uptake (SUR+EX group; n = 12). Critically, SUR+EX group received additional dietary energy intake account energy expended exercise, thus maintaining matched energy surplus. baseline follow-up, fasted blood samples abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies obtained oral glucose tolerance tests conducted. Insulinaemic responses standard glucose load increased 2-fold baseline follow-up SUR group (17 +/- 16 nmol (120 min) l(-1); P = 0.002) whereas change SUR+EX group (1 +/- 6 nmol (120 min) l(-1)). Seven 17 genes within adipose tissue differentially expressed SUR group; expression SREBP-1c, FAS GLUT4 significantly up-regulated expression PDK4, IRS2, HSL visfatin significantly down-regulated (P </= 0.05). pAMPK/AMPK protein ratio adipose tissue significantly down-regulated SUR group (P = 0.005). Vigorous-intensity exercise counteracted effects short-term overfeeding under-activity whole-body level adipose tissue, even face standardised energy surplus.
