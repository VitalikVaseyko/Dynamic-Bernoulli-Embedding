 dynamics fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cycle investigated open homogeneous system reconstituted purified enzymes. addition phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerases involved. time evolution metabolite concentrations governed set differential equations take account flow processes enzymic conversions metabolites. Depending experimental parameters stable attractors, multiple states sustained oscillations occur. main source nonlinear dynamics reciprocal effect AMP activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. States characterized net flow rates substrates rate futile substrate cycling. efficient glycolytic states high ratios influx rates fructose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate maximum activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase must maintained, efficient gluconeogenic mode reverse must hold. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate exerts reciprocal effects activities phosphofructokinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. dependence experimental conditions fructose 2,6-bisphosphate found either generate extinguish oscillations.
