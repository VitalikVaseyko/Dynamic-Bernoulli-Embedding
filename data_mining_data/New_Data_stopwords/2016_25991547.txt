 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) modulate energy homeostasis multiple tissues cell types, various nutrient conditions, phosphorylation alpha subunit (PDHE1alpha, also known PDHA1) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. However, roles PDKs meiotic maturation currently unknown. Here, undertaking knockdown overexpression analysis PDK paralogs (PDK1-PDK4) mouse oocytes, established site-specificity PDKs towards phosphorylation three serine residues (Ser232, Ser293 Ser300) PDHE1alpha. found PDK3-mediated phosphorylation Ser293-PDHE1alpha results disruption meiotic spindle morphology chromosome alignment decreased total ATP levels, probably inhibition PDH activity. Unexpectedly, discovered PDK1 PDK2 promote meiotic maturation, knockdown disturbs assembly meiotic apparatus, without significantly altering ATP content. Moreover, phosphorylation Ser232-PDHE1alpha demonstrated mediate PDK1 PDK2 action meiotic maturation, possibly mechanism distinct PDH inactivation. findings reveal divergent roles PDKs oocyte maturation indicate new mechanism controlling meiotic structure.
