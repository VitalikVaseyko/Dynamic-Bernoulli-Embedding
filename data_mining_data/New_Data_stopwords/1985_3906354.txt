 Peripheral hyperinsulinemia may associated metabolic consequences could contribute high incidence macrovascular disease patients diabetes mellitus. Arterial wall striated muscle cells studied dogs examine effect hyperinsulinemia lipid content lipogenic glycolytic enzyme activity. Eight pancreatectomized dogs received segmental pancreatic autografts venous drainage iliac vein. Glucose disappearance rates (K values) normal four years transplantation, fasting serum insulin levels (48.9 +/- 4.8 v 11.8 +/- 1.9 microU/mL) total area glucose-insulin response curve (1797 +/- 196 v 1110 +/- 158 microU X min/mL) significantly greater control animals (P less 0.05). hyperinsulinemic dogs marked triglyceride elevation arterial smooth muscle (20.6 +/- 8.0 v 0.5 +/- 0.4 mumol/g) striated muscle (171.4 +/- 46.6 v 41.2 +/- 7.7 mumol/g) (P less 0.001). Moreover, key enzymes lipid synthesis (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA DH) significantly increased (P less 0.01) hyperinsulinemic animals, glycolytic enzymes, (phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, alpha-glycerophosphate DH) significantly different. data demonstrate substantial enhancement lipid synthesis arterial wall striated muscle hyperinsulinemic dogs. Altered substrate metabolism arterial walls, association hyperinsulinemia, may important implications regard macrovascular disease diabetes, particularly insulin-treated patients. addition, studies may serve stimulate longer term assessments macroangiopathy increasing number patients functioning pancreatic allografts draining systemic circulation.
