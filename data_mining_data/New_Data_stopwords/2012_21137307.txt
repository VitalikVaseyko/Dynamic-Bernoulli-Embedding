 OBJECTIVE: inhibit expression pyruvate kinase (PK) mRNA Giardia lamblia specific hammerhead ribozyme. METHODS: constructed hammerhead-GCV vector (pGCV-PKH) aims PK mRNA electroporated G. lamnblia trophozoites (group A). Electroporated trophozoites (group B) normal trophozoites (group C) served control Trophozoites group collected 24, 48, 72 96 h post-electroporation, respectively. concentrations trophozoites calculated growth curves constructed. 24, 48, 72 96 h post-electroporation, mRNA group detected RT-PCR real-time PCR, respectively. PK activity tested ultraviolet spectrophotometry. RESULTS: growth curve showed growth trophozoites considerably depressed 96 h post-electroporation. RT-PCR result displayed specific ribozyme mRNA detected group 24 h 96 h post-electroporation. 24 48 h transfection, PK mRNA level group decreased 5% (5 +/- 0.17) 8% (8 +/- 0.19) level group C, respectively; PK activity group decreased 32% (32 +/- 0.64) 38% (38 +/- 0.65) level group C. CONCLUSION: PK mRNA expression G. lamblia inhibited specific hammerhead ribozyme.
