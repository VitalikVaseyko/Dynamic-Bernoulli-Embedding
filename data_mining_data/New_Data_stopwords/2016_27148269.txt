 Immunometabolism, study relationship bioenergetic pathways specific functions immune cells, recently gained increasing appreciation. response infection, activation host innate adaptive immune cells accompanied switch bioenergetic pathway oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, metabolic remodeling known Warburg effect, required production antimicrobial pro-inflammatory effector molecules. review, summarize current understanding Warburg effect discuss association expression host immune responses tuberculosis (TB), infectious disease caused Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). also discuss potential mechanisms underlying Warburg effect focus expression regulation hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), regulatory subunit HIF-1, major transcription regulator involved cellular stress adaptation processes, including energy metabolism antimicrobial responses. also propose novel hypothesis Mtb perturbs Warburg effect immune cells facilitate survival persistence host. better understanding dynamics metabolic states immune cells specific functions TB pathogenesis lead development immunotherapies capable promoting Mtb clearance reducing Mtb persistence emergence drug resistant strains.
