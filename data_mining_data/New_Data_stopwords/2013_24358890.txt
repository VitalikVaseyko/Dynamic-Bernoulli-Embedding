 Despite universality metabolic pathways, malignant cells found metabolism reprogrammed generate energy glycolysis even normal oxygen concentrations (the Warburg effect). Therefore, pathway energetically 18 times less efficient oxidative phosphorylation implicated match increased energy requirements growing tumors. paradox explained abnormally high rate glucose uptake, assuming unlimited availability substrates tumor growth vivo. However, ultrastructural analysis tumor vasculature morphogenesis showed growing tissue regions continuous blood supply intermittently depended autophagy survival. Erythrogenic autophagy, resulting ATP generation glycolysis, appeared critical initiating vasculature formation missing. study focused ultrastructural features reflected metabolic switch aerobic anaerobic. Morphological differences within different types cells evident tissue sections. cells undergoing nucleo-cytoplasmic conversion erythrosomes (erythrogenesis), gradual changes led replacing mitochondria peroxisomes, intermediate form connected endoplasmic reticulum. findings related issue peroxisome biogenesis phenomenon hemogenic endothelium. Mitochondria compacted also mitosis. vivo, cells lost others retained capability use oxygen coexisted side-by-side; types important vasculature morphogenesis tissue growth. passable, new vasculature segment could deliver external oxygen nutrients. Nutritional redox status microenvironment similar effect metabolism malignant non-malignant cells demonstrating necessity maintain structure-energy equivalence living cells. role glycolysis initiating vasculature formation, progression cell cycle mitosis, indicated Warburg effect fundamental biological significance extending non-malignant tissues. approach used could facilitate integration accumulated cyber knowledge cancer metabolism predictive science.
