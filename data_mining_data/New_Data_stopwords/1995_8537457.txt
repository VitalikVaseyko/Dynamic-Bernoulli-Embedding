 new bioluminescent detection system combined sandwich DNA hybridisation reaction microwells developed detection human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) provirus DNA amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR). First, fragment HIV-1 gag gene amplified. amplified DNA fragments denatured hybridised capture probe immobilised microwells biotinylated detection probe. streptavidin-pyruvate kinase conjugate could react biotinylated probe kinase activity detected means luciferin-luciferase system, production bioluminescent signal. sandwich assay followed bioluminescent reaction detected little 7 amol target DNA. bioluminescent assay detected 5 HIV copies generated one round PCR, even band seen agarose gel. assay applied detection HIV-proviral DNA peripheral blood mononuclear cells one round PCR allowed clearly identify positive sample compared nested PCR.
