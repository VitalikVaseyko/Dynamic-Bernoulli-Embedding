 Using recently established ICSH recommended methods, red cell pyruvate kinases (PK) 20 patients PK deficiency characterized 7 new PK variants found. Analysis partially purified red cell pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) patient P5N deficiency provided evidence structural alteration enzyme protein. Red cell adenosine deaminase (ADA) patient 40-fold increase ADA activity associated hemolytic anemia purified compared normal subjects. conceivable increased ADA activity represents increased amount structurally normal enzyme.
