 Acetate accumulation common problem observed aerobic high cell density cultures Escherichia coli. hypothesized previous reports glyoxylate shunt active E. coli BL21, low acetate producer, inactive E. coli JM109, high acetate producer. hypothesis strengthened incorporating 13C uniformly labeled glucose TCA cycle intermediates. Using northern blot analyses, current report demonstrates reason inactivity glyoxylate pathway E. coli JM109 apparent transcription isocitrate lyase (aceA) malate synthase (aceB), transcription isocitrate lyase repressor (iclR). reverse seen E. coli BL21 glyoxylate pathway active due constitutive transcription aceA aceB transcription iclR. addition, difference two strains transcription acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs), phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (pta-ackA) pathway, pyruvate oxidase (poxB), pathway. transcript acs higher E. coli BL21 lower E. coli JM109, reverse true poxB transcription.
