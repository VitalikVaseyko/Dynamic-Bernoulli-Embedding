 Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase activity cytosol E. pancreaticum approximately 10 times higher pyruvate kinase activity. Malate dehydrogenase converts oxaloacetate malate 27 times actively malate oxaloacetate. main end product glycolysis presented succinate. Probably, important glycolytic pathway trematode investigated fixation CO2 phosphoenol pyruvate produce oxaloacetate.
