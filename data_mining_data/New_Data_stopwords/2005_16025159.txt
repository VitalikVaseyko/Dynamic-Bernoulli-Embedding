 Recently, shown PFKFB4 gene encodes testis isoenzyme PFKFB also expressed prostate hepatoma cancer cell lines. studied expression hypoxic regulation testis isoenzyme PFKFB4 several malignant cell lines female organ--the mammary gland. studies clearly demonstrated PFKFB4 mRNA also expressed mammary gland malignant cells (MCF-7 T47D cell lines) normoxic conditions hypoxia strongly induces expression. better understand mechanism hypoxic regulation PFKFB4 gene expression, used dimethyloxalylglycine, specific inhibitor HIF-1alpha hydroxylase enzymes, strongly increases HIF-1alpha levels mimics effect hypoxia. observed PFKFB4 expression MCF7 T47D cell lines highly responsive dimethyloxalylglycine, suggesting hypoxia responsiveness PFKFB4 gene cell lines regulated HIF-1 proteins. Moreover, desferrioxamine cobalt chloride, mimic effect hypoxia chelating substituting iron, similar stimulatory effect expression PFKFB mRNA. mammary gland malignant cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-468, SKBR-3) hypoxia hypoxia mimics also induced PFKFB4 mRNA, variable degrees. hypoxic induction PFKFB4 mRNA equivalent expression PFKFB3, Glut1, VEGF, known HIF-1-dependent genes. Hypoxia dimethyloxalylglycine increased PFKFB4 protein levels cell lines studied except MDA-MB-468. site-specific mutagenesis 5'-flanking region PFKFB4 gene hypoxia response could limited. Thus, study provides evidence PFKFB4 gene also expressed mammary gland cancer cells strongly responds hypoxia via HIF-1alpha dependent mechanism. Moreover, PFKFB4 PFKFB3 gene expression mammary gland cancer cells also significant role Warburg effect found malignant cells.
