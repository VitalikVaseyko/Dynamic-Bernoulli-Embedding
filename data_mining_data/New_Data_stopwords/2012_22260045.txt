 OBJECTIVE: order optimize precursor supply L-arginine biosynthesis, constructed Corynebacterium crenatum 8-193 mutant gamma-glutamyl kinase gene (proB) in-frame deletion. effects proB knock-out physiological characteristics mutant investigated. METHODS: upstream downstream fragments proB cloned C. crenatum 8-193 chromosome ligated integration vector. mutant C. crenatum 8-193-deltaproB obtained homologous recombination. mutant phenotype reversed complementation proB gene expression vector. physiological characteristics mutant investigated measurement activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCx) pyruvate carboxylase (PYC). RESULTS: proB gene in-frame deletion screened confirmed PCR, gamma-glutamyl kinase determination complementation. mutant lost ability growth minimal medium without proline addition. proB knock-out mutant resulted decrease cell mass 9.6% increase L-arginine accumulation 13.6% compared parent strain. analysis by-products fermentation broth showed concentrations glutamate-related aspartate-related amino acids increased, concentrations alpha-ketoglutaric acid, PEP succinic acid decreased. specific activities PEPCx PYC increased 8-193-deltaproB. CONCLUSION: proB gene knock-out strain 8-193 blocked branch catabolism L-glutamate improved efficiency glucose utilization L-arginine accumulation.
