 investigated whether substrate availability influences type energy metabolism procyclic Trypanosoma brucei. show absence glycolytic substrates (glucose glycerol) induce shift fermentative metabolism complete oxidation substrates. also show glucose (and even glycolysis) essential normal functioning proliferation pleomorphic procyclic T. brucei cells. Furthermore, absence glucose result increased degradation amino acids. Variations availability glucose glycerol result, however, adaptations metabolism way glycosome always redox balance. argue likely that, procyclic cells, phosphoglycerate kinase located cytosol, also inside glycosomes, otherwise ATP deficit would occur organelle. demonstrate procyclic T. brucei uses parts Krebs cycle purposes complete degradation mitochondrial substrates. suggest citrate synthase plus pyruvate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase used transport acetyl-CoA units mitochondrion cytosol biosynthesis fatty acids, process show occur proliferating procyclic cells. part Krebs cycle consisting alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase succinyl-CoA synthetase used degradation proline glutamate succinate. also demonstrate subsequent enzymes Krebs cycle, succinate dehydrogenase fumarase, likely used conversion succinate malate, used gluconeogenesis.
