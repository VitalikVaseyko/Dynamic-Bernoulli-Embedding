 Methamphetamine (METH) abuse reached epidemic proportions, become increasingly recognized abusers suffer wide range neurocognitive deficits. Much previous work focused deleterious effects METH mature neurons, little known effects METH neural progenitor cells (NPCs). well established new neurons continuously generated NPCs adult hippocampus, accumulating evidence suggests important roles neurons hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. rat hippocampal NPC culture system, find METH results dose-dependent reduction NPC proliferation, higher concentrations METH impair NPC survival. NPC differentiation, however, affected METH, suggesting cell-stage specificity effects METH. demonstrate effects METH NPCs are, part, mediated oxidative nitrosative stress. Further, identify seventeen NPC proteins post-translationally modified via 3-nitrotyrosination response METH, using mass spectrometric approaches. One protein pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), important mediator cellular energetics proliferation. identify sites PKM2 undergo nitrotyrosination, demonstrate nitration protein impairs activity. Thus, METH abuse may result impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis, effects NPCs may mediated protein nitration. study implications development novel therapeutic approaches METH-abusing individuals neurologic dysfunction may applicable neurodegenerative diseases hippocampal neurogenesis impaired.
