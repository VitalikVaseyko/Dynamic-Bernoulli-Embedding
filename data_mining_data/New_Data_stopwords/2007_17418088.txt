 report initial studies phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism coupled mitochondria isolated Jerusalem artichoke tubers. found that: (1) phosphoenolpyruvate metabolized Jerusalem artichoke mitochondria virtue presence mitochondrial pyruvate kinase, shown immunologically functionally, located inner mitochondrial compartments distinct cytosolic pyruvate kinase shown different pH inhibition profiles. (2) Jerusalem artichoke mitochondria take externally added phosphoenolpyruvate proton compensated manner, carrier-mediated process investigated measuring fluorimetrically oxidation intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotide occurs result phosphoenolpyruvate uptake alternative oxidase activation. (3) addition phosphoenolpyruvate causes pyruvate ATP production, monitored via HPLC, efflux extramitochondrial phase investigated fluorimetrically. efflux occurs via putative phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate/ATP antiporters, differ pyruvate adenine nucleotide carriers, light different sensitivity non-penetrant compounds. carriers shown regulate rate efflux pyruvate ATP. appearance citrate oxaloacetate outside mitochondria also found result phosphoenolpyruvate addition.
