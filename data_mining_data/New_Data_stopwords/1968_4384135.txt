 1. activities enzymes involved utilization glucose (pyruvate kinase, ATP citrate lyase, NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase, present supernatant fraction liver homogenates) formation glucose gluconeogenesis (glucose 6-phosphatase whole homogenate fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, NAD-specific malate dehydrogenase fumarase supernatant fraction) determined rat liver around birth postnatal period end weaning. 2. activities enzymes involved conversion glucose lipid low neonatal period increase weaning. NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase first appears develops beginning weaning period. 3. marked increase cytoplasmic phosphopyruvate carboxylase activity birth probably major factor initiating gluconeogenesis time. 4. results discussed known changes dietary supplies known metabolic patterns period development.
