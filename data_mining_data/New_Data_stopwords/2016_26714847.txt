 Biomarkers muscle protein synthesis rate could provide early data demonstrating anabolic efficacy treating muscle-wasting conditions. Androgenic therapies shown increase muscle mass primarily increasing rate muscle protein synthesis. hypothesized synthesis rate large numbers individual muscle proteins could serve early response biomarkers potentially treatment-specific signaling predicting effect anabolic treatments muscle mass. Utilizing selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) treatment ovariectomized (OVX) rat, applied unbiased, dynamic proteomics approach measure fractional synthesis rates (FSR) 167-201 individual skeletal muscle proteins triceps, EDL, soleus. OVX rats treated SARM molecule (GSK212A 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg) 10 28 days showed significant, dose-related increases body weight, lean body mass, individual triceps EDL soleus weights. Thirty-four 94 proteins measured triceps rats exhibited significant, dose-related increase FSR 10 days SARM treatment. several cytoplasmic proteins, including carbonic anhydrase 3, creatine kinase M-type (CK-M), pyruvate kinase, aldolase-A, change 10-day FSR strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.90-0.99) 28-day change lean body mass triceps weight gains, suggesting noninvasive measurement SARM effects. summary, FSR multiple muscle proteins measured dynamics moderate- high-abundance proteins provides early biomarkers anabolic response skeletal muscle SARM.
