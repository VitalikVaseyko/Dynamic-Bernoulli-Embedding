 vivo studies demonstrated hepatic glucose production poorly responsive insulin genetically obese Zucker rats. work, investigated modulation insulin basal gluconeogenesis, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase activities hepatocytes isolated fed obese (fa/fa) lean (Fa/-) rats. Gluconeogenesis estimated conversion mixture [14C]lactate-pyruvate [14C]glucose. Basal gluconeogenesis significantly reduced hepatocytes isolated obese rats compared measured hepatocytes lean animals (0.63 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.47 +/- 0.05 mumol lactate converted glucose/g cells.20 min; n = 3-4; P < 0.001). hepatocytes isolated lean rats, insulin, without affecting cellular cAMP concentration, caused dose-dependent inhibition rate gluconeogenesis, accompanied significant increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels activation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase. contrast, hepatocytes isolated obese (fa/fa) rats, neither basal gluconeogenesis metabolic parameters mentioned significantly modified insulin, even assayed high hormonal concentrations (10 nM). results demonstrate lack responsiveness hepatic gluconeogenesis short term insulin action genetically obese (fa/fa) rats.
