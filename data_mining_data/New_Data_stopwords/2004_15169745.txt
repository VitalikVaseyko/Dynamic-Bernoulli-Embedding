 Prolonged moderate-intensity exercise characterized progressive reduction carbohydrate oxidation concomitant increase fat oxidation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) controls entry pyruvate oxidative pathways rate-limiting enzyme carbohydrate metabolism. PDH controlled activities kinase (PDK, inhibitory) phosphatase (stimulatory). test hypothesis increased PDK activity associated decreased PDH activity carbohydrate oxidation acute exercise bout, seven recreationally active men completed 4 h cycle exercise 55% peak oxygen consumption. Muscle samples obtained 10 min 4 h exercise measurement PDH activity extraction intact mitochondria measurements PDK activity PDK-2 PDK-4 protein expression. Carbohydrate oxidation reduced (P < 0.05) exercise duration. Muscle glycogen content lower (P < = 0.05) 4 h compared rest change muscle pyruvate content 10 240 min exercise (10 min: 0.28 +/- 0.05; 240 min: 0.35 +/- 0.09 mmol/kg dry muscle). PDH activity increased (P < 0.05) resting values 10 min (2.86 +/- 0.26 mmol.min(-1).kg wet muscle(-1)), lower 10 min 4 h (2.23 +/- 0.24 mmol.min(-1).kg wet muscle(-1)) exercise. PDK-2 PDK-4 protein expression different rest 10 min 4 h exercise. PDK activity rest averaged 0.081 +/- 0.016 min(-1), similar 10 min, increased (P < 0.05) 0.189 +/- 0.013 min(-1) 4 h. Although reduced glycolytic flux may played role decreasing carbohydrate oxidation, results suggest increased PDK activity contributed reduction PDH activity carbohydrate oxidation late prolonged exercise. increased PDK activity independent changes intra-mitochondrial effectors, PDK-2 PDK-4 protein content, suggesting caused change specific activity existing kinases.
