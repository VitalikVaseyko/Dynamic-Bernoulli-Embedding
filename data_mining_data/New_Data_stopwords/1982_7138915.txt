 cytosolic phosphate potential estimated isolated rat liver parenchymal cells incubated various gluconeogenic substrates. value cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] ratio either estimated directly measurements ATP, ADP Pi digitonin fractionation cells, calculated metabolite indicator method. cells incubated lactate, pyruvate alanine net flux indicator enzymes gluconeogenic direction, excellent agreement values obtained two methods wide range fluxes. However, cells incubated substrates could converted glucose lactate net flux indicator enzymes glycolytic direction, large difference values cytosolic [ATP]/([ATP][Pi]) ratio derived two methods observed. concluded reaction catalyzed glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase plus 3-phosphoglycerate kinase equilibrium flux reaction glycolytic direction, use metabolite indicator method calculation cytosolic phosphate potential conditions leads erroneous values.
