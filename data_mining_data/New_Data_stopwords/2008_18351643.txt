 hypoxia-responsiveness glycolytic machinery may allow pretreatment identification hypoxic tumors HIF-1 targets (e.g., Glut-1) [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography results mixed. hypothesized discrepancy inevitable consequence elevated aerobic glycolysis tumors (Warburg effect) energetics predominantly glycolytic cells little affected hypoxia. Accordingly, characterized glycolytic mitochondrial ATP generation normoxic anoxic cell lines. Measurements demonstrated cancer cells rely largely aerobic glycolysis accounts 56-63% ATP budget, cervical carcinoma SiHa, ATP synthesis mainly mitochondrial. Moreover, stimulatory effect anoxia glycolytic flux inversely correlated relative reliance aerobic glycolysis. Next, tumor cells representing Warburg nonglycolytic phenotype grown mice spatial patterns hypoxia (pimonidazole-stained), Glut-1 expression (18)F-FDG uptake analysed sectioned tumors. SiHa tumors foci elevated glucose metabolism consistently colocalize regions hypoxia elevated Glut-1 expression. contrast, spatial patterns Glut-1 pimonidazole staining correlated reasonably well tumors. conclusion, Glut-1's value hypoxia marker severely restricted aerobic glycolysis. contrast, specificity (18)F-FDG uptake Glut-1 expression markers regional hypoxia glucose metabolism, respectively, scales inversely intensity Warburg effect. linkage suggests multi-tracer imaging combining FDG hypoxia-specific markers may provide therapeutically relevant information tumor energetic phenotypes.
