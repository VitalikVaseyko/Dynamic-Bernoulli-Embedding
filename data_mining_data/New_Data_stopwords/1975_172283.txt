 means microdissection technique applied kidney tissue, following results obtained: Hexokinase, enzyme glycolysis, revealed low activity proximal high activity distal tubule. distribution pattern consistent finding glucose main fuel distal tubule. Glucose-6-phosphatase, enzyme gluconeogenesis, demonstrates significant activity distal tubule glomerulus. structures are, however, glucose producers. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, key enzyme gluconeogenesis, found segments proximal tubule. distal tubule lacks activity. also case starvation metabolic acidosis gluconeogenesis stimulated. Glutamic dehydrogenase, -an enzyme possibly connected ammoniagenesis-, malate- lactate dehydrogenase-, enzymes involved hydrogen transfer mitochondrial membrane-, showed close parallelism phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase distribution along proximal tubule. bidirectional function glyceraldehyde-P dehydrogenase well documented close correlation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (gluconeogenesis) proximal tubule pyruvic kinase (glycolysis) distal tubule.
