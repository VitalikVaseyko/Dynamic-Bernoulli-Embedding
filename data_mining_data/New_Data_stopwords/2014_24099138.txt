 Cancer cells reprogram metabolism maintain rapid proliferation often stressful conditions. Glycolysis glutaminolysis two central pathways fuel cancer metabolism. Allosteric regulation metabolite driven post-translational modifications key metabolic enzymes allow cancer cells glycolysis glutaminolysis respond changes nutrient availability tumor microenvironment. increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) noted part cancer metabolism 80 years, recent work shown elevated levels glycolytic intermediates critical cancer growth metabolism due ability feed anabolic pathways branching glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway serine biosynthesis pathway. key glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), pyruvate kinase (PKM2) phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) regulated upstream downstream metabolites balance glycolytic flux flux anabolic pathways. Glutamine regulation tightly controlled metabolic intermediates allosterically inhibit activate glutamate dehydrogenase, fuels tricarboxylic acid cycle converting glutamine derived glutamate alpha-ketoglutarate. elucidation key allosteric regulatory hubs cancer metabolism essential understanding predicting cancer cells respond drugs target metabolism. Additionally, identification structures involved allosteric regulation inform design anti-metabolism drugs bypass off-target effects substrate mimics. Hence, review aims provide overview allosteric control glycolysis glutaminolysis.
