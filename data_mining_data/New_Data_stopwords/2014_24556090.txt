 Activated cells undergo metabolic reprogramming promotes glycolytic flux lactate production well elevated production lipids, proteins, nucleic acids carbohydrates (i.e. induction biomass) even presence oxygen. Activated cells show induced expression of, among things, Glucose Transporter 1 several glycolytic enzymes, including ADP-Dependent Glucokinase low affinity isoform Pyruvate Kinase-M2 (which promote glycolytic flux), well Glutamine Transporters Glycerol-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase 2 make available glutamate glycerol-3-phosphate mitochondrial energy sources. Intracellular leucine concentrations critically regulate mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling promote Th1, Th2, Th17 CD4(+) effector cell differentiation. contrast, regulatory (Treg) cells generated AMP-Activating Protein Kinase signaling activated mTOR activation suppressed. Unlike effector CD4(+) CD8(+) cells, Tregs memory cells oxidize fatty acids fuel. Effector memory cells perform different functions thus show distinct metabolic profiles exquisitely controlled cellular signaling. Upon activation, cells express insulin leptin receptors surface become sensitive insulin signaling nutrient availability show changes differentiation. Thus, metabolism nutrient availability influence cell activation function.
