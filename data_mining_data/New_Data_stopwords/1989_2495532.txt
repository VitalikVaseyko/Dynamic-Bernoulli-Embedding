 Using vitro amplification cDNA polymerase chain reaction, detected spliced transcripts various tissue-specific genes (genes anti-Mullerian hormone, beta-globin, aldolase A, factor VIIIc) human nonspecific cells, fibroblasts, hepatoma cells, lymphoblasts. rats, erythroid- liver-type pyruvate kinase transcripts also detected brain, lung, muscle. abundance "illegitimate" transcripts low; yet, existence possibility amplifying cDNA polymerase chain reaction provide powerful tool analyze pathological transcripts tissue-specific gene using accessible cell.
