 alkalization intracellular pH (pHin) advances together enhancement aerobic glycolysis within tumor cells (the Warburg effect), responsible progression tumor malignancy together hypoxia angiogenesis. correlate tumor growth poorly understood, partly due lack suitable imaging methods. present study, propose novel method visually determine pHin tumor xenograft model fluorescent image ratios. utilized tandemly-linked two fluorescent proteins pH indicator; yellow fluorescent protein (YFP, pH sensitive) indicator, red fluorescent protein (RFP, pH insensitive) reference. method eliminate influence optical factors tissue well diverse expression level pH indicator grafted cells. addition, operated filter-based fluorescent imagers generally used small animal study. efficacy pH indicator, RFP-YFP, confirmed studies using recombinant protein vitro HeLa cells expressing RFP-YFP vivo. Furthermore, prepared nude mice subcutaneously xenografted HeLa cells expressing RFP-YFP cells tumor model. image ratios (YFP/RFP) tumor day 5 surgery clearly showed heterogeneous distribution diverse pHin cells tumor tissue. Concomitantly acquired angiography using near-infrared fluorescence (680 nm emission) also indicated relative alkaline pHin cells located region far tumor vessels tumor aerobic glycolysis would facilitated progression hypoxia nutrient starvation. Applying present method multi-wavelength imaging concerning pO2 and/or nutrient starvation states addition pHin angiogenesis would provide valuable information complicated alteration tumoral cell states tumorigenesis.
