 malignant tumors exhibit Warburg effect, consists increased glycolysis rates production lactate, even presence oxygen. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), maintain glycolytic rates, mediating influx and/or efflux lactate overexpressed several cancer cell types. lactate pyruvate analogue 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) inhibitor energy metabolism, proposed specific antitumor agent. present study, aimed determining effect 3-BP breast cancer cells evaluated putative role MCTs effect. results showed three breast cancer cell lines used presented different sensitivities 3-BP: ZR-75-1 ER (+)>MCF-7 ER (+)>SK-BR-3 ER (-). also demonstrated 3-BP reduced lactate production, induced cell morphological alterations increased apoptosis. effect 3-BP appears cytotoxic rather cytostatic, continued decrease cell viability observed removal 3-BP. showed pre-incubation butyrate enhanced significantly 3-BP cytotoxicity, especially resistant breast cancer cell line, SK-BR-3. observed butyrate treatment induced localization MCT1 plasma membrane well overexpression MCT4 chaperone CD147. results thus indicate butyrate pre-treatment potentiates effect 3-BP, probably increasing rates 3-BP transport MCT1/4. study supports potential use butyrate adjuvant 3-BP treatment breast cancer resistant cells, namely ER (-).
