 phosphorylation pig liver pyruvate kinase cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase studied. comparison, mixed histone synthetic heptapeptide also used substrates. Protein kinase purified chromatography DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, Sephadex G-200. enzyme stimulated cyclic AMP apparent Ka values 2.5 0.8 x 10-7 pyruvate kinase histone substrates, respectively. Divalent cations essential activity protein kinase. Variation concentration ATP resulted approximately straight lines Lineweaver-Burk plots phosphorylation pyruvate kinase mixed histone. apparent Km values ATP 21 11 muM, respectively. phosphorylation rate increased concentration pyruvate kinase even concentration 2 muM pyruvate kinase. high ionic strength, phosphorylation rate pyruvate kinase histone decreased. phosphorylation rate varied markedly pH imidazole/HC1 Tris/HC1 buffers. slightly alkaline pH values, pyruvate kinase phosphorylated much higher rate pH7, case histone. pH 8.5, phosphorylation rate pyruvate kinase 3.5 times rate pH 7, corresponding increase histone phosphorylation 50 per cent. potassium phosphate buffers, phosphorylation rate substrates change significantly pH range studied. Arrhenius' plots protein kinase reaction resulted break 10 degrees pyruvate kinase used substrate, whereas straight line obtained using histone. negative allosteric effectors pyruvate kinase, alanine, phenylalanine, increased phosphorylation rate pyruvate kinase pH 8 50 120 per cent, respectively. effectors influence phosphorylation rate mixed histone synthetic heptapeptide. concluded conformations adopted pyruvate kinase presence allosteric inhibitors make better substrate protein kinase.
