 purified aurochs heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) saturated approximation 60% endogenous thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), slowly incompletely inactivated kinase presence ATP. Exogenous TPP ADP, pyruvate, strongly inhibited kinase activity. kinetic properties aurochs heart PDC kinase suggested occurrence two active sites different affinities ATP (K'm - 1.7 microM, K''m = 48 microM).
