 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) one major energy sensor both: cellular whole body level. exists heterotrimer containing three subunits: catalytic alpha subunit, beta regulatory gamma. AMPK localized cytoplasm nucleus. activated increasing concentrations AMP energy shortage, causing activation catabolic pathways inhibition energy consuming processes. AMPK activity regulated allosterically: binding AMP regulatory gamma subunit, well phosphorylation Thr172 catalytic alpha subunit kinases. Activated AMPK effectively inhibit mTOR pathway hyperactive many types cancer. hand AMPK inactivation associates type II diabetes, diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance development metabolic disorders. AMPK dysfunction also observed inflammation. discovered last years abnormalities AMPK function induce metabolic reprogramming cancer cells known Warburg effect. Additionally, AMPK activated irradiation. activation leads inhibition growth. hand, active AMPK enables cells survive difficult conditions hypoxia, glucose deprivation. crucial role maintaining energy homeostasis AMPK excellent therapeutic target. However, still remains unknown better: activate inhibit AMPK function.
