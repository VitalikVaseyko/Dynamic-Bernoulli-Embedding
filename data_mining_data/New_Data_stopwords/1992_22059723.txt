 Twenty-four pigs assigned one four ad libitum water treatments: control, sodium bicarbonate (12.6 g/litre), low ammonium chloride (4 g/litre) high ammonium chloride (8 g/litre) 5 days, study influence oral acid base load post-mortem changes longissimus dorsi muscle ultimate pork quality. Physiological changes slaughter monitored measuring blood pH, pCO(2) HCO(3)(-). influence dietary treatments post-mortem changes ultimate meat quality determined measuring glycolytic enzymes intermediates, muscle pH, color water-holding capacity (WHC). expected, sodium bicarbonate generated metabolic alkalosis, whereas ammonium chloride resulted metabolic acidosis. Pre-slaughter acid-base status positively correlated muscle WHC (P < 0.05). However, significant dietary treatment effect observed muscle quality traits color (a, b, L) WHC. Muscle pH(45) significantly (P < 0.05) higher bicarbonate control high ammonium chloride treatments. activity Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase significantly (P < 0.05) higher 45 min post-mortem pyruvate kinase significantly lower 2 4 h post mortem bicarbonate-treated pigs. 45 min post mortem, activity fructose-1,6-diphosphatase control pigs significantly higher (P < 0.05) treatments. concentration glycogen significantly (P < 0.05) higher bicarbonate high ammonium chloride pigs; bicarbonate-treated pigs also significantly higher adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) pH values treatment groups (P < 0.05) early post-mortem. concluded pre-slaughter oral loading acid base could induce changes muscle metabolism post-mortem muscle pH. research required confirm altering diet acidogenicity alkalinogenicity may means enhancing ultimate pork quality.
