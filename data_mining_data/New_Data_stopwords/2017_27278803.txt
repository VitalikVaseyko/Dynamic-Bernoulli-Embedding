 study aims evaluate effect regular post-exercise cold water immersion (CWI) intramuscular markers cellular stress response signaling molecules related mitochondria biogenesis exercise performance 4 weeks high intensity interval training (HIIT). Seventeen healthy subjects allocated two groups: control (CON, n = 9) CWI (n = 8). HIIT session consisted 8-12 cycling exercise stimuli (90-110 % peak power) 60 followed 75 active recovery three times per week, 4 weeks (12 HIIT sessions). HIIT session, CWI lower limbs immersed cold water (10 degrees C) 15 min CON recovered room temperature. Exercise performance evaluated HIIT 15-km cycling time trial. Vastus lateralis biopsies obtained pre 72 h post training. Samples analyzed heat shock protein 72 kDa (Hsp72), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) assessed western blot. addition, mRNA expression heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), nuclear respiratory factor 1 2 (NRF1 2), mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam), calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2) enzymes citrate synthase (CS), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) assessed real-time PCR. Time complete 15-km cycling time trial reduced training (p < 0.001), different groups (p = 0.33). Hsp72 (p = 0.01), p38 MAPK, AMPK (p = 0.04) contents increased training, different groups (p > 0.05). differences observed training condition mRNA expression PGC-1alpha (p = 0.31), CPT1 (p = 0.14), CS (p = 0.44), NRF-2 (p = 0.82). However, HFS-1 (p = 0.007), PDK4 (p = 0.03), Tfam (p = 0.03) mRNA higher CWI. NRF-1 decrease groups training (p = 0.006). CaMK2 decreased HIIT (p = 0.003) affected CWI (p = 0.99). Cold water immersion alter HIIT-induced Hsp72, AMPK, p38 MAPK, exercise performance able increase markers cellular stress response signaling molecules related mitochondria biogenesis.
