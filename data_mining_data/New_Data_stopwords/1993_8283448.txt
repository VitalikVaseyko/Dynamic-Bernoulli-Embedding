 method developed measure activities enzymes extracts single human preimplantation embryos. method permits analysis two enzymes plus appropriate controls extract single embryo, used investigate control energy metabolism development human embryos two-cell blastocyst stage. Hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (ALD), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODH) detectable, whereas glycogen phosphorylase (GP) not. enzyme activities ODH, PFK, LDH, PK, GPI G6PDH, averaged stages development two-cell blastocyst stage (days 2-6 insemination), 3.5, 6.6, 15, 69, 73 87 times greater HK, respectively. activity ALD similar HK. activities ALD, GPI, PFK, PK LDH showed significant variation stage development, although activity GPI fell significantly four-eight cell eight-sixteen cell stage (P < 0.05). HK activity decreased two-eight cell eight-sixteen cell (P < 0.05), increased significantly eight-sixteen cell blastocyst stage (P < 0.01). overall relationship hexokinase activity stage approached significance (P = 0.059, one-way analysis variance). activity G6PDH decreased significantly development (P < 0.001, one way analysis variance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
