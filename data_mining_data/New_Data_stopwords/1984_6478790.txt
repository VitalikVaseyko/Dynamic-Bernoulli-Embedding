 Pyruvate kinase activity Trypanosoma brucei brucei stimulated presence L-carnitine inhibited acetyl CoA, ATP ATP-Mg2+ complex. Increased pyruvate kinase activity associated stimulation ATP synthesis presence L-carnitine. evidence carnitine stimulates pyruvate kinase activity indirectly removing inhibitory modulator acetyl CoA result carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) also present trypanosomes.
