 KEY POINTS: study aimed provide molecular insight differential effects age physical inactivity regulation substrate metabolism moderate-intensity exercise. Using arteriovenous balance technique, studied effect immobilization one leg 2 weeks leg substrate utilization young older men two-legged dynamic knee-extensor moderate-intensity exercise, well changes key proteins muscle metabolism exercise. Age immobilization affect relative carbohydrate fat utilization exercise, older men higher uptake exogenous fatty acids, whereas young men relied endogenous fatty acids exercise. Using combined whole-leg molecular approach, provide evidence age physical inactivity result intramuscular lipid accumulation, occurs part mechanisms. ABSTRACT: Age inactivity associated intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) accumulation. Here, attempt disentangle factors studying effect 2 weeks unilateral leg immobilization substrate utilization across legs moderate-intensity exercise young (n = 17; 23 +/- 1 years old) older men (n = 15; 68 +/- 1 years old), contralateral leg served control. immobilization, participants performed two-legged isolated knee-extensor exercise 20 +/- 1 W ( approximately 50% maximal work capacity) 45 min catheters inserted brachial artery femoral veins. Biopsy samples obtained vastus lateralis muscles legs exercise used analysis substrates, protein content enzyme activities. exercise, leg substrate utilization (respiratory quotient) differ groups legs. Leg fatty acid uptake greater older young men, although young men demonstrated net leg glycerol release exercise, older men showed net glycerol uptake. baseline, IMTG, muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity protein content adipose triglyceride lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)gamma3 higher young older men. Furthermore, adipose triglyceride lipase, plasma membrane-associated fatty acid binding protein AMPKgamma3 subunit protein contents lower IMTG higher immobilized contralateral leg young older men. Thus, immobilization age affect substrate choice (respiratory quotient) moderate exercise, whole-leg molecular differences fatty acid mobilization could explain age- immobilization-induced IMTG accumulation.
