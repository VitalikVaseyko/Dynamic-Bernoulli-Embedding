 Hypoxia recognized play role promoting invasive metastatic behaviour cancer cells. Largely via transcription factor, hypoxia-induced factor 1, hypoxia exerts significant effects cellular metabolism, numerous downstream consequences. Energetically significant shift away oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria towards glycolysis, state also involved 'Warburg effect'. proteins involved mediating altered metabolic pathways seen tumour cells thus represent new targets potential therapeutic intervention. Hypoxia associated development aggressive phenotypes cancer cells, accompanied changes carbohydrate lipid metabolism impact tumour cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis. Herein, examine glycolytic less investigated metabolic pathways relation cancer hypoxia, focus emerging tools large-scale metabolite profiling ('metabolomics'). Metabolomic technologies permit measurement wide range metabolites untargeted manner, however, date, technology relatively utilized studying cellular responses hypoxia. detail common experimental approaches employed metabolomics experiments, including nuclear magnetic resonance new mass spectrometry-based methods analysis. Selected examples application technologies study metabolic alterations brought hypoxia provided, particularly relate energy, carbohydrate, lipid metabolism. Finally, potential therapeutic targeting metabolic processes activated hypoxia presented.
