 Methotrexate use anti-cancer agent 60 years. Though inhibition dihydrofolate reductase best known mechanisms action, non-dihydrofolate reductase dependent mechanisms disrupt metabolic pathways resulting depletion NAD(P)H increasing oxidative stress. mechanisms highlight novel dependence cancer cells metabolic abnormalities buffer oxidative stress chemotherapeutic agents interfere cellular abilities. Mitochondria appear play significant role maintaining cancer cell viability alterations metabolism seen cancer cells aid mitochondrial ability. research needed understand effects chemotherapeutic agents pathways.
