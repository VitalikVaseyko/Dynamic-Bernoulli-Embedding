 marked reduction granulocyte chemotactic function accompanies storage granulocyte concentrates. Since chemotaxis energy dependent, studied energy metabolism stored neutrophils. others reported stored neutrophils defect energy metabolism. found defective adenosine triphosphate maintenance stored neutrophils occult resting cells, unmasked energy-intensive stimulus, phagocytosis. studies reported here, sought determine defective adenosine triphosphate maintenance granulocyte storage related altered glycolytic enzyme activity. studied activity glycolytic enzymes fresh stored, resting stimulated (opsonized zymosan) neutrophils. following enzyme activities showed major changes storage, resting stimulated neutrophils: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glucose phosphate isomerase, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase. contrast, pyruvate kinase activity consistently increased storage. 6 units, pyruvate kinase activity increased 75 percent 24 hours storage room temperature 198 percent 48 hours. storage-associated increase pyruvate kinase activity inhibited cycloheximide. Stimulation neutrophils phagocytosis opsonized zymosan also produced striking increases pyruvate kinase activity fresh stored cells. Additional studies indicated increases pyruvate kinase activity observed storage phagocytosis associated increase availability pyruvate kinase activity supernatant fraction neutrophil sonicates. Total pyruvate kinase activity sonicates neutrophils unchanged storage particle ingestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
