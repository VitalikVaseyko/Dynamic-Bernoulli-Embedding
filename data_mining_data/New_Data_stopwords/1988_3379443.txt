 determine whether respiratory muscles undergo alterations enzyme activities energy metabolism result increased mechanical activity, adult male Wistar rats subjected prolonged endurance training program. Analysis maximal enzyme activity patterns diaphragm following 15 weeks extreme training (final running duration: 210 min per day, 27 m.min-1 15 degrees grade, indicated significant reductions marker enzymes citric acid cycle (citrate synthase), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), ketone body utilization (3-keto acid: CoA transferase) transamination (glutamate pyruvate transaminase, GPT). changes found enzymes glycogenolysis (phosphorylase, PHOSPH), glycolysis (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase, HK) beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl: CoA dehydrogenase, HAD) following training. contrast, external intercostal muscle, increases range 57-77% noted enzymes CS HAD, whereas internal intercostal muscles training induced alteration evident enzymes. intercostal muscles, consistent trend noted towards reduction glycolytic enzymes investigated, however, significantly lower values recorded PK LDH internal intercostals. GPT increased internal intercostal muscles. findings indicate response pattern observed enzyme activities studied following training degree specific respiratory muscle investigated.
