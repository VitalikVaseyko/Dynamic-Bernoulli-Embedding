 Effect carnitine synthetic analogue 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate (THP) studied rats experimental infarction myocardium following occlusion left anterior descending coronary artery. Morphological biochemical changes determined within 24 hrs occlusion. infarcted area diminished 29.8% 18.7% 10.9%, rats treated THP carnitine, respectively. drugs studied affected favourably activities malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes well aminotransferase activities blood plasma. Administration carnitine caused increase content lactate pyruvate blood plasma, ratio decreased. Thus, modulation fatty acids metabolism using betaine derivatives caused cardioprotective effect.
