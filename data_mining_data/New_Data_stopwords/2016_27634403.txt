 Peroxiredoxin abundant peroxidase, non-peroxidase function also important. study, discovered Tsa1, major peroxiredoxin budding yeast cells, required efficient flux gluconeogenesis. found suppression pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) via interaction Tsa1 contributes part gluconeogenic enhancement. physical interactions Pyk1 Tsa1 augmented shift glycolysis gluconeogenesis. Intriguingly, peroxidatic cysteine catalytic center Tsa1 played important role physical Tsa1-Pyk1 interactions. interactions enhanced exogenous H2O2 endogenous reactive oxygen species, increased gluconeogenesis. peroxidatic cysteine, catalytic cysteine Tsa1, required efficient growth metabolic shift obtain maximum yeast growth (biomass). Tsa1 function separable peroxidase function antioxidant. first report demonstrate peroxiredoxin novel nonperoxidase function redox-dependent target modulator pyruvate kinase modulated via alternative mechanism.
