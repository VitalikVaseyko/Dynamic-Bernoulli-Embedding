 Hypoxia pervasive microenvironmental factor affects normal development well tumor progression. normal cells, hypoxia stabilizes hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), particularly HIF-1, activates genes involved anaerobic metabolism angiogenesis. hypoxia signals cellular deprivation state, HIF-1 also reported counter activity MYC, encodes transcription factor drives cell growth proliferation. Since many human cancers express dysregulated MYC, sought determine whether HIF-1 would fact collaborate dysregulated MYC rather countering function. Here, using P493-6 Burkitt's lymphoma model inducible MYC, demonstrate HIF-1 cooperates dysregulated c-Myc promote glycolysis induction hexokinase 2, catalyzes first step glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase diminishes mitochondrial respiration. also found collaborative induction vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) HIF-1 dysregulated c-Myc. study reports previously unsuspected collaboration HIF-1 dysregulated MYC thereby provides additional insights regulation VEGF Warburg effect, describes propensity cancer cells convert glucose lactate.
