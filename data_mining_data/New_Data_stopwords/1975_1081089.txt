 Whole-body gamma-irradiation (1200 R) female rats significantly increased liver glycogen incorporation glucose (U-14C) liver fatty acids. Administration cystamine irradiation protected enhanced lipogenesis glucose (U-14C), afforded partial protection liver glycogen levels. Irradiation significantly decreased activities liver pyruvate kinase isocitrate dehydrogenase, decrease prevented administration cystamine irradiation. significant increase activity liver malate dehydrogenase (dehydrogenating) noted irradiated rats, prevented administration cystamine irradiation. Irradiation affect activities combined hexose monophosphate pathway dehydrogenases malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating).
