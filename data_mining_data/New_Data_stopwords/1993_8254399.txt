 Japanese white rabbits transplanted VX2 liver tumors considered suitable experimental model evaluation therapeutic modalities. However, adequate method assessing changes tumor metabolism treatment. present study, 15 rabbits VX2 liver tumors examined PET using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG). intravenous injection 18F-FDG, serial arterial blood sampling performed. One hour tracer injection, small pieces normal liver tissue tumor tissue excised determine radioactivity. Dynamic PET images obtained 11 tumor-bearing rabbits, tumor enzyme activities determined six rabbits. Fluorine-18-FDG uptake VX2 liver tumors 3.5 +/- 0.9 times higher normal liver tissue; good contrast tumor normal liver tissue achieved PET scans. enzyme activity study showed VX2 tumors increased levels hexokinase pyruvate kinase activity, suggesting increase glycolysis. conclude transplanted VX2 liver tumors could appropriately evaluated 18F-FDG PET.
