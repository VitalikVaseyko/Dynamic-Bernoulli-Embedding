 Cancer biologists seem overlooked tumor metabolism research endeavors last 80 years last century, "rediscovered Warburg" (Warburg et al. 1930; Warburg, Science 123(3191):309-314, 1956) within first decade twenty-first century, well suggest importance other, non-glucose-dependent, metabolic pathways fatty acid de novo synthesis catabolism (beta-oxidation) (Mashima et al., Br J Cancer 100:1369-1372, 2009) glutamine catabolism (glutaminolysis) (DeBerardinis et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci 104(49):19345-19350, 2007). non-glucose metabolic pathways seem important Warburg effect, potentially human cancer. purpose review highlight importance fatty acid metabolism cancer cells and, necessary, identify gaps current knowledge postulate hypothesis based upon findings cellular physiology metabolic diseases normal cells.
