 Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase catalyses reversible metal-dependent formation oxaloacetate ATP PEP, ADP, CO2 plays key role gluconeogenesis. enzyme also oxaloacetate decarboxylase pyruvate kinase-like activities. Mutations PEP carboxykinase constructed residues Lys213 His233, two residues putative Mn2+ binding site enzyme, altered. Replacement residues Arg Gln, respectively, generated enzymes 1.9 2.8 kcal/mol lower Mn2+ binding affinity. Lower PEP binding affinity inferred mutated enzymes protection effect PEP urea denaturation. Kinetic studies altered enzymes show least 5000-fold reduction V(max) primary reaction relative wild-type enzyme. V(max) values oxaloacetate decarboxylase pyruvate kinase-like activities PEP carboxykinase affected much lesser extent mutated enzymes. mutated enzymes show decreased steady-state affinity Mn2+ PEP. results consistent Lys213 His233 Mn2+ binding site S. cerevisiae PEP carboxykinase Mn2+ affecting PEP interaction. different effects mutations V(max) main reaction secondary activities suggest different rate-limiting steps reactions.
