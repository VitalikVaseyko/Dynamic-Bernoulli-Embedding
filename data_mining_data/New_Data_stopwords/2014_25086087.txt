 last decade, field cancer metabolism mainly focused studying role tumorigenic metabolic rewiring supporting cancer proliferation. Here, perform first genome-scale computational study metabolic underpinnings cancer migration. build genome-scale metabolic models NCI-60 cell lines capture Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) typically occurring cancer cells. extent Warburg effect cell line models quantified ratio glycolytic oxidative ATP flux (AFR), found highly positively associated cancer cell migration. hence predicted targeting genes mitigate Warburg effect reducing AFR may specifically inhibit cancer migration. testing anti-migratory effects silencing 17 top predicted genes four breast lung cancer cell lines, find 13 novel predictions significantly attenuate cell migration either one cell line only, almost effect cell proliferation. Furthermore, accordance predictions, significant reduction observed ratio experimentally measured ECAR OCR levels following perturbations. Inhibiting anti-migratory targets promising future avenue treating cancer since may decrease cytotoxic-related side effects plague current anti-proliferative treatments. Furthermore, may reduce cytotoxic-related clonal selection aggressive cancer cells likelihood emerging resistance.
