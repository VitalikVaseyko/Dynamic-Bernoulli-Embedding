 human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) comprises four multidomain components, E1, E3, E2 E3-binding protein (E3BP), latter two forming core E2.E3BP sub-complex. Pyruvate flux PDC regulated via phosphorylation (inactivation) E1 four PDC kinases (PDKs), reactivation two PDC phosphatases. Up-regulation PDK isoform gene expression reported several forms cancer, PDKs may activated PDC binding E2.E3BP core. Hence, PDK: E2.E3BP interaction provides new therapeutic targets. carried functional kinetic thermodynamic studies demonstrate significant differences activation PDK isoforms binding E2.E3BP core: (i) PDK2 needs activation E2.E3BP efficient functioning, PDK4 least effective four isoforms, could activated E2.E3BP. Hence, development inhibitors interaction PDK2 PDK4 E2.E3BP promising; (ii) Design inhibitors interfere interaction E2.E3BP PDK1 PDK3 promising. PDK3 needs E2.E3BP core activation, activation best achieved synergistic combination E2-derived catalytic domain tridomain.
