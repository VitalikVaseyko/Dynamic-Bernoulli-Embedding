 important prevent improve diabetes mellitus complications safe low-cost manner. S-Allyl cysteine, aged garlic extract antioxidant activity, investigated determine whether S-allyl cysteine improve type 2 diabetes Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats age-matched Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats used divided two groups 29 weeks age. S-Allyl cysteine (0.45% diet) administered rats 13 weeks. Rats killed 43 weeks age, detailed analyses performed. S-Allyl cysteine improved hemoglobinA1c, blood glucose, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Furthermore, S-allyl cysteine normalized plasma insulin levels. S-Allyl cysteine activated mRNA protein expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha gamma, well inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rat liver. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c forkhead box O1 proteins normalized S-allyl cysteine Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rat liver. conclusions, findings support hypothesis S-allyl cysteine diabetic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease therapeutic potential potent regulating agent lipogenesis glucose metabolism.
