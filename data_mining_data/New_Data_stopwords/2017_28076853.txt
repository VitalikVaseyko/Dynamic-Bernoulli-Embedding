 Cells generate adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP), major currency energy-consuming reactions, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis. One remarkable features cancer cells aerobic glycolysis, also known "Warburg Effect", cancer cells rely preferentially glycolysis instead mitochondrial OXPHOS main energy source even presence high oxygen tension. One main players controlling OXPHOS mitochondrial gatekeeperpyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) major subunit E1alpha (PDHA1). analyze function PDHA1 cancer cells, knock (KO) human prostate cancer cell line LnCap stable KO cell line established. demonstrated PDHA1 gene KO significantly decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS promoted anaerobic glycolysis, accompanied higher stemness phenotype including resistance chemotherapy, enhanced migration ability increased expression cancer stem cell markers. also examined PDHA1 protein expression prostate cancer tissues immunohistochemistry observed reduced PDHA1 protein expression clinical prostate carcinomas significantly correlated poor prognosis. Collectively, results show negative PDHA1 gene expressionis associated significantly higher cell stemness prostate cancer cells reduced protein expression gene associated shorter clinical outcome prostate cancers.
