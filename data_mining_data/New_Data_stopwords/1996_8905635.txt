 Kinetic behaviour rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK alpha) studied multi-enzyme complex (PDC) contained two preparations: mitochondria (mPDC) high speed pellet Triton-extracted tissue (hPDC). Two parameters evaluated: Vav, related Vmax, Fractional Pyruvate Inhibition (FPI). Starvation rats 48 h led rise Vav fall FPI. Injection starved rats agents reduce beta-oxidation fatty acids restored, succession, FPI Vav, hPDC, levels found hPDC fed animals. vitro incubation 30 degrees C hPDC starved animals restored FPI, Vav 'fed' values; restored vitro incubation mPDC starved animals within time frame vivo experiments. sharp increase FPI, Vav, hPDC fed starved rats observed later experiments. could due differential selection two genes isoenzymes PDHK alpha proposed workers.
