 beginning twentieth century, discoveries cancer research began elucidate idiosyncratic metabolic proclivities tumor cells (1). Investigators postulated revealing distinct nutritional requirements cells unchecked growth potential would reveal targetable metabolic vulnerabilities survival could selectively curtailed. Soon thereafter, researchers field immunology began drawing parallels metabolic characteristics highly proliferative cancer cells immune cells respond perceived threats host physiology invading tissues, clonally expanding, generating vast amounts pro-inflammatory effector molecules provide host protection. Throughout past decade, increasing effort gone elucidating biosynthetic bioenergetic requirements immune cells inflammatory responses. well established that, like tumor cells, immune cells must undergo metabolic adaptations fulfill effector functions (2, 3). Unraveling metabolic adaptations license inflammatory immune responses may lead development novel classes therapeutics pathologies prominent inflammatory components (e.g., autoimmunity). However, translational potential discoveries made toward end currently limited ubiquitous nature "pathologic" process targeted: metabolism. Recent works started unravel unexpected non-metabolic functions metabolic enzymes context inflammation, including signaling gene regulation. One way information gained study immunometabolism may leveraged therapeutic benefit exploiting non-canonical features metabolic machinery, modulating contribution immune response without impacting basal metabolic functions. focus review discuss metabolically independent functions glycolytic enzymes could impact cells, agents immune system commonly considered orchestrators auto-inflammatory processes.
