 congenital erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency found 72-year old female patient chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Erythrocyte PK deficiency associated increase activity hexokinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase glutathione peroxidase erythrocytes well decrease acetylcholinesterase, glutathione reductase glucosephosphate isomerase activities. enzymatic abnormalities accompanied alterations hemoglobin antigen content erythrocyte membrane. addition, bone marrow ultrastructural studies showed dyshemopoietic changes blood cell lines especially erythroblasts. present findings confirm close relationship CMML acquired dyserythropoietic syndromes constitute new observation infrequent association hereditary erythrocyte enzymopathies leukemia. survey literature presented.
