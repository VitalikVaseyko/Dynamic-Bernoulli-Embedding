 mechanism acetate assimilation purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, lacks glyoxylate shortcut, studied. previous work, proceeding data acetate assimilation Rba. sphaeroides cell suspensions, suggestion made regarding operation, bacterium, citramalate cycle. cycle earlier found Rhodospirillum rubrum form anaplerotic reaction sequence operates growth acetate instead glyoxylate shortcut, present latter bacterium. present work considers enzymes responsible acetate assimilation Rba. sphaeroides. shown bacterium possesses key enzymes citramalate cycle: citramalate synthase, catalyzes condensation acetyl-CoA pyruvate and, result, forms citramalate, 3-methylmalyl-CoA lyase, catalyzes cleavage 3-methylmalyl-CoA glyoxylate propionyl-CoA. regeneration pyruvate, acetyl-CoA acceptor citramalate cycle, involves propionyl-CoA occurs via following reaction sequence: propionyl-CoA (+ CO2) --> methylmalonyl-CoA --> succinyl-CoA --> succinate --> fumarate --> malate --> oxalacetate (- CO2) --> phosphoenolpyruvate --> pyruvate. independence cell growth acetate assimilation CO2 due accumulation CO2/HCO3- (released acetate assimilation) cells level sufficient effective operation propionyl-CoA carboxylase.
