 Pyruvate kinase Trypanosoma brucei labile enzyme, losing activity within several hours. mixtures containing 50 mM triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, 25% glycerol 0.5 mM inorganic phosphate enzyme remained active could purified homogeneity specific activity 417 units mg-1 yield 65%. enzyme activation energy 31.9 kJ mol-1. Magnesium potassium ions essential activity. Cobalt manganese ions replace Mg2+ leads decrease maximal velocity. Potassium ions substituted ammonium ions, sodium ions behave competitive inhibitor respect K+ NH4+. metal ions studied displayed sigmoidal kinetics. enzyme activated, decreasing efficiency fructose 2-phosphorothioate 6-phosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. display hyperbolic kinetics. Glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, CoASAc, oxalate, AMP, ADP, ATP inhibit enzyme. substrate saturation PK activated Pi concentration 0.8 mM. higher Pi concentrations enzyme inhibited. enzyme unaffected amino acids, phenylalanine stimulates tyrosine inhibits.
