 UNLABELLED: introduction combined PET/MR spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, possible directly indirectly image Warburg effect hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate (18)F-FDG PET imaging, respectively, via technique named hyperPET. main purpose present study establish practical workflow performing (18)F-FDG PET hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate MRS imaging simultaneously tumor tissue characterization larger scale test feasibility. addition, evaluated correlation (18)F-FDG uptake (13)C-lactate production. METHODS: Ten dogs biopsy-verified spontaneous malignant tumors included imaging. dogs underwent protocol simultaneous (18)F-FDG PET, anatomic MR, hyperpolarized dynamic nuclear polarization (13)C-pyruvate imaging. data acquired using combined clinical PET/MR imaging scanner. RESULTS: found combined (18)F-FDG PET (13)C-pyruvate MRS imaging possible single session approximately 2 h. continuous workflow obtained injection (18)F-FDG dogs placed PET/MR scanner. (13)C-MRS dynamic acquisition demonstrated axial slab increased (13)C-lactate production 9 10 dogs. 9 dogs, (13)C-lactate detected mean 25 (range, 17-33 s), mean peak (13)C-lactate 49 (range, 40-62 s). (13)C-pyruvate could detected average 13 (range, 5-26 s) peaked average 25 (range, 13-42 s). noticed concordance (18)F-FDG uptake production (13)C-lactate most, all, axial slices. CONCLUSION: study, shown series dogs cancer hyperPET easily performed within 2 h. showed mostly correspondence (13)C-lactate production (18)F-FDG uptake expect combined modalities reveal additional metabolic information improve prognostic value improve response monitoring.
