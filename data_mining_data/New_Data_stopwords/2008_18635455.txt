 objective study determine whether patients chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) display differences organization metabolic pathways segments involved energy supply compared healthy control subjects. Metabolic pathway potential, based measurement maximal activity (V(max)) representative enzymes, assessed tissue extracted vastus lateralis seven patients COPD (age 67 +/- 4 yr; FEV(1)/FVC = 44 +/- 3%, FEV(1) forced expiratory volume 1 FVC forced vital capacity; means +/- SE) nine healthy age-matched controls (age 68 +/- 2 yr; FEV(1)/FVC = 75 +/- 2%). Compared control, COPD patients displayed lower (P < 0.05) V(max) (mol.kg protein(-1).h(-1)) cytochrome c oxidase (COX; 21.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 28.7 +/- 2.2) 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH; 2.54 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.74 +/- 0.12) citrate synthase (CS; 2.20 +/- 0.16 vs. 3.19 +/- 0.5). differences groups observed V(max) creatine phosphokinase, phosphorylase (PHOSPH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase (HEX) elevated COPD (P < 0.05). Enzyme activity ratios higher (P < 0.05) HEX/CS, HEX/COX, PHOSPH/HADH PFK/HADH COPD compared control. concluded COPD patients exhibit reduced potential electron transport system fat oxidation increased potential glucose phosphorylation potential glycogenolysis glycolysis remains normal. comparison enzyme ratios indicated greater potentials glucose phosphorylation relative citric acid cycle electron transport chain glycogenolysis glycolysis relative beta-oxidation.
