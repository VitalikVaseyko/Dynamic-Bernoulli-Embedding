 Even though aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, arguably common trait metabolic reprogramming cancer, unobserved certain tumor types. Systems biology advocates global view metabolism dissect traits consistently reprogrammed cancer, hence likely constitute obligate step evolution cancer cells. refer traits symmetric. Here, review early systems biology studies attempted reveal symmetric traits metabolic reprogramming cancer, discuss symmetry reprogramming nucleotide metabolism, outline current limitations that, unlocked, could elucidate whether symmetries cancer metabolism may claimed.
