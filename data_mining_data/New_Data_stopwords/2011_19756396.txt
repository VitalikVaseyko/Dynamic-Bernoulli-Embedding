 Genistein reported potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Inhibitory activity tyrosine kinase activation protein kinase (PKA) shown play role genistein-induced potentiation effect GSIS. aim present study elucidate mechanism genistein-induced potentiation insulin secretion. Genistein augmented insulin secretion INS-1 cells stimulated various energy-generating nutrients glucose, pyruvate, leucine/glutamine (Leu/Gln), secretion stimulated depolarizing agents KCl tolbutamide, Ca(2+) channel opener Bay K8644. Genistein concentration 50 muM showed maximum potentiation effect Leu/Gln-stimulated insulin secretion, sufficient inhibit activity tyrosine kinase. Inhibitor studies well immunoblotting analysis demonstrated activation PKA little involved genistein-induced potentiation Leu/Gln-stimulated insulin secretion. hand, inhibitors Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II tested, significantly diminished genistein-induced potentiation. Genistein also elevated levels [Ca(2+)]i phospho-CaMK II. Furthermore, genistein augmented Leu/Gln-stimulated insulin secretion CaMK II-overexpressing INS-1 cells. data suggest activation CaMK II played role genistein-induced potentiation insulin secretion.
