 1. Red cell pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) high low potassium (K) dogs shown exist multiple forms separable electrophoresis ion-exchange chromatography. R2-type pyruvate kinase, determined young type enzyme canine red cells, shown predominant form pyruvate kinase high K cells. 2. M2-type pyruvate kinase, prototype isozyme erythroid cells, existed high K dog erythrocytes well high K low K dog reticulocytes. 3. Isozyme analysis high K red cell hexokinase also showed profile similar obtained low K reticulocytes. 4. results seem reflect immaturity high K erythrocytes, suggest abnormal cell differentiation maturation may occur early stage erythroid cell proliferation high K dogs.
