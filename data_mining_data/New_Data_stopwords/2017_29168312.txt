 Erlotinib potent, selective, orally active inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor, development erlotinib resistance chemotherapy lead treatment failure. shed light erlotinib-resistant pathway, study investigated effect combination therapy using curcumin- erlotinib-loaded nanoparticles expression alphav beta3 integrin pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) erlotinib-resistant SW480 colon cancer cell line. erlotinib-resistant SW480 colon cancer cell line produced long-term exposure erlotinib. Curcumin-loaded Methoxy poly ethylene glycol Poly caprolactone (cur/mPEG-PCL) erlotinib-loaded mPEG-PCL (erl/mPEG-PCL) micelles provided using single step nanoprecipitation method used combination therapy resistant SW480 cancer cells. that, gene expression levels PDK4, alphav, beta3 mRNA determined semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels whole alphav beta3 integrin evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. SW480 cell line, IC50 nonresistant resistant cells 87.6 +/- 1.2 nM 19.1 +/- 0.14 muM, erlotinib 21.8 30 muM curcumin, respectively. Although PDK4 expression significantly different resistant nonresistant cells, expression regulated (1.4 fold) resistant cells combination therapy cur/mPEG-PCL dose 3 muM erl/mPEG-PCL dose 5 muM. beta3 mRNA protein level whole alphav beta3 integrin significantly higher resistant SW480 cells compared nonresistant cells. terms treatment, combination 6-muM cur/mPEG-PCL 5-muM erl/mPEG-PCL regulated beta3 gene expression 6.6-fold resistant cells compared nonresistant cells. protein level, combination 3-muM-cur/mPEG-PCL 10-muM erl/mPEG-PCL reduced alphav beta3 protein resistant cells. results indicated combination therapy using cur/mPEG-PCL erl/mPEG-PCL could decrease alphav beta3 integrin expression increase PDK4 gene expression resistant colon cancer cells, may effects drug resistance signaling pathways.
