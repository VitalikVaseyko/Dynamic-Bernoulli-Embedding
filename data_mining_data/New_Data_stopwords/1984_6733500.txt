 Tetanic stimulation fibers hippocampal slice preparation produces long-term potentiation (LTP) also decreases vitro incorporation phosphate alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (alpha PDH). paper describes 6 experiments undertaken replicate observation. Hippocampal slices incubated specially designed chamber stimulated tungsten wire electrode stratum radiatum 1 100 Hz. Two minutes tetanus, stimulated slices removed alternately control (not tetanized) slices group pooled subcellular fractionation labeling fractions [32P]ATP. Proteins separated electrophoresis relative 32P contents 41K 50K protein bands studied. Tetanic stimulation stratum radiatum affect subsequent phosphorylation 50K Mr protein reported altered perforant path activation. Stimulation also effect pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity ratio active (dephosphorylated) inactive enzyme. cases tetanic stimulation produced significant change vitro phosphorylation enzyme. one set conditions, labeling 250 microM [gamma-32P]ATP 10 s, decrease vitro labeling alpha PDH shown statistically significant. findings suggest LTP necessarily accompanied initial change PDH phosphorylation level activity may associated decrease kinase activity directed toward protein.
