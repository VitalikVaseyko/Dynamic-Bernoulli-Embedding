 Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis N-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis, demonstrate mutant global regulatory protein ArcA fails decrease synthesis TCA cycle enzymes malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase E3 succinate dehydrogenase response stasis, increased production glycolysis enzymes phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase unaffected. Microcalorimetric respiratory measurements show continued production TCA cycle enzymes (delta)arcA mutant manifested elevated rate respiration total metabolic activity starvation. (delta)arcA mutant severely impaired surviving prolonged periods exogenous carbon starvation, phenotype alleviated overproducing superoxide dismutase SodA. addition, flow cytometry demonstrates starving (delta)arcA mutant cells, contrast wild-type cells, fail perform reductive division, remain large contain multiple chromosomal copies. suggest ArcA-dependent reduced production electron donors decreased level activity aerobic respiratory apparatus growth arrest integral part defense system aimed avoiding damaging effects oxygen radicals controlling rate utilization endogenous reserves.
