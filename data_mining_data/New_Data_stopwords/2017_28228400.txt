 Chronic kidney diseases generally lead renal fibrosis. Despite great progress made identifying molecular mediators fibrosis, mechanism governs renal fibrosis remains unclear, far effective therapeutic antifibrosis strategy available. demonstrated switch metabolism oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) renal fibroblasts primary feature fibroblast activation renal fibrosis suppressing renal fibroblast aerobic glycolysis could significantly reduce renal fibrosis. gene protein assay showed expression glycolysis enzymes upregulated mouse kidneys unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) surgery transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-treated renal interstitial fibroblasts. Aerobic glycolysis flux, indicated glucose uptake lactate production, increased mouse kidney UUO nephropathy TGF-beta1-treated renal interstitial fibroblasts positively correlated fibrosis process. line this, found increasing aerobic glycolysis remarkably induce myofibroblast activation aerobic glycolysis inhibitors shikonin 2-deoxyglucose attenuate UUO-induced mouse renal fibrosis TGF-beta1-stimulated myofibroblast activation. Furthermore, mechanistic study indicated shikonin inhibits renal aerobic glycolysis via reducing phosphorylation pyruvate kinase type M2, rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme associated cell reliance aerobic glycolysis. conclusion, findings demonstrate critical role aerobic glycolysis renal fibrosis support treatment aerobic glycolysis inhibitors potential antifibrotic strategy.
