 Mass spectra native-like protein complexes often exhibit narrow charge-state distributions, broad peaks, contributions multiple, coexisting species. factors make challenging interpret spectra, particularly mixtures significant heterogeneity. demonstrate use ion/ion proton transfer reactions reduce charge states m/z-selected, native-like ions proteins protein complexes, technique refer cation anion proton transfer reactions (CAPTR). demonstrate CAPTR increase accuracy charge state assignments resolution interfering species native mass spectrometry. CAPTR product ion spectra pyruvate kinase exhibit ~30 peaks enable unambiguous determination charge state peak, whereas corresponding precursor spectra exhibit ~6 peaks assigned charge states uncertainty +/-3%. 15+ bovine serum albumin 21+ yeast enolase dimer appear near m/z 4450 completely unresolved mixture. single CAPTR event, resulting product ions baseline resolved. separation product ions increases dramatically subsequent CAPTR event; 12 events resulted 3000-fold improvement separation relative precursor ions. Finally, introduce framework interpreting predicting figures merit CAPTR experiments. generally, results suggest CAPTR strongly complements mass spectrometry tools analyzing proteins protein complexes, particularly mixtures.
