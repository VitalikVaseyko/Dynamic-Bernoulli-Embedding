 transcription factor FoxO1 contributes metabolic adaptation fasting suppressing muscle oxidation glucose, sparing glucose-dependent tissues. Previously, reported FoxO1 activation C(2)C(12) muscle cells recruits fatty acid translocase CD36 plasma membrane increases fatty acid uptake oxidation. This, together FoxO1 induction lipoprotein lipase, would promote reliance fatty acid utilization characteristic fasted muscle. Here, show CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake, turn, up-regulates protein levels activity FoxO1 well target PDK4, negative regulator glucose oxidation. Increased fatty acid flux enforced CD36 expression C(2)C(12) cells sufficient induce FoxO1 PDK4, whereas CD36 knockdown opposite effects. vivo, CD36 loss blunts fasting induction FoxO1 PDK4 associated suppression glucose oxidation. Importantly, CD36-dependent regulation FoxO1 mediated nuclear receptor PPARdelta/beta. Loss PPARdelta/beta phenocopies CD36 deficiency blunting fasting induction muscle FoxO1 PDK4 vivo. Expression PPARdelta/beta C(2)C(12) cells, like CD36, robustly induces FoxO1 suppresses glucose oxidation, whereas co-expression dominant negative PPARdelta/beta compromises FoxO1 induction. Finally, several PPRE sites identified FoxO1 promoter, responsive PPARdelta/beta. Agonists PPARdelta/beta sufficient confer responsiveness transactivate heterologous FoxO1 promoter presence dominant negative PPARdelta/beta. Taken together, findings suggest CD36-dependent FA activation PPARdelta/beta results transcriptional regulation FoxO1 well PDK4, recently shown direct PPARdelta/beta target. FoxO1 turn regulate CD36, lipoprotein lipase, PDK4, reinforcing action PPARdelta/beta increase muscle reliance FA. findings could implications chronic abnormalities fatty acid metabolism associated obesity diabetes.
