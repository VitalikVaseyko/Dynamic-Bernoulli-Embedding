 Tourniquet-imposed ischemia-reperfusion extremities generates reactive oxygen nitrogen species (RONS), disrupt intermediary metabolism ATP production. study tested hypothesis fluid resuscitation pyruvate, natural antioxidant metabolic fuel, ameliorates deleterious effects ischemia-reperfusion intermediary metabolism skeletal muscle. Anesthetized male goats ( approximately 25 kg) bled mean arterial pressure 48 +/- 1 mmHg subjected 90 min hindlimb ischemia tourniquet femoral crossclamp, followed 4-h reperfusion. Lactated Ringers (LR) pyruvate Ringers (PR) infused intravenous 90 min, 30 min ischemia 30 min reperfusion, deliver 0.05 mmol kg(-1) min(-1) lactate pyruvate. Time controls (TC) underwent neither hemorrhage hindlimb ischemia. Lipid peroxidation product 8-isoprostane, RONS-sensitive aconitase creatine kinase activities, antioxidant superoxide dismutase activity, phosphocreatine phosphorylation potential ([PCr]/[{Cr}{P(i)}]), index tissue energy state, measured reperfused gastrocnemius 90 min resuscitation (n = 6 groups) 3.5 h post-resuscitation (n = 8 TC, 9 LR, 10 PR). PR effectively LR suppressed 8-isoprostane formation, prevented inactivation aconitase creatine kinase, doubled superoxide dismutase activity, augmented [PCr]/([Cr][P(i)]). Pyruvate-enriched Ringer's metabolically superior Ringer's lactate fluid resuscitation tourniqueted muscle.
