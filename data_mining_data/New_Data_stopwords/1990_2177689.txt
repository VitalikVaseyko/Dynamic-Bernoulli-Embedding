 case mitochondrial encephalomyopathy partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency reported special reference electrophysiological studies. 56-year-old man readmitted Himeji Central Hospital due mental deterioration character change. age 44 attacked first epileptic seizure, admitted Himeji Central Hospital, EEG abnormalities cerebral atrophy found. Anticonvulsants helped relieve generalized convulsions EEG abnormalities persisted. age 46, second generalized seizure, quit job crane operator. family began notice deterioration intellectual function hyperaggressive behavior. daily activities, intellectual performance mental condition gradually deteriorated (WAIS FIQ less 60). clinical laboratory findings follows: bilateral impaired hearing, optic nerve atrophy, disturbance extra ocular muscle movements, mild wasting weakness extremities, normal coordination sensation, myoclonus involuntary movements, normal laboratory data serum creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase aldolase, increased amount lactate pyruvate serum cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), abnormal amino acids urine. biopsy specimen right biceps brachii muscle revealed numerous ragged-red fibers frozen sections stained Gomori trichrome method. fibers react cytochrome c oxidase staining. ATPase staining demonstrated atrophy type-2 fibers. electron micrograph showed many mitochondria sarcoplasm paracrystalline inclusions. biochemical analysis muscle biopsy also revealed significant decrease cytochrome c oxidase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
