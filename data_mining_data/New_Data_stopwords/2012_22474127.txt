 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expressed low levels skeletal muscle, protects adiposity insulin resistance via unclear mechanisms. test hypothesis PPARgamma directly modulates skeletal muscle metabolism, created two models isolate direct PPARgamma actions skeletal myocytes. PPARgamma overexpressed murine myotubes adenotransfection mouse skeletal muscle plasmid electroporation. cultured myotubes, PPARgamma action increased fatty acid uptake incorporation myocellular lipids, dependent upon 154 +/- 20-fold up-regulation CD36 expression. PPARgamma overexpression doubled insulin-stimulated thymoma viral proto-oncogene (AKT) phosphorylation low lipid availability. Furthermore, myotubes exposed palmitate levels inhibit insulin signaling, PPARgamma overexpression increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation glycogen synthesis 3-fold despite simultaneously increasing myocellular palmitate uptake. insulin signaling enhancement associated increase activating phosphorylation phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 normalized expression palmitate-induced genes antagonize AKT phosphorylation. vivo, PPARgamma overexpression doubled insulin-dependent AKT phosphorylation lipid-treated mice augment insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. conclude direct PPARgamma action promotes myocellular storage energy increasing fatty acid uptake esterification simultaneously enhancing insulin signaling glycogen formation. However, direct PPARgamma action skeletal muscle sufficient account hypoglycemic actions PPARgamma agonists lipotoxicity.
