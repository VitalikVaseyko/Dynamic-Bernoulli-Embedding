 advent recent molecular studies, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia caused red blood cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency considered caused structural mutation PK-LR gene. PK deficiency monogenic disorder, introduction normal PK gene patient's bone marrow stem cells cure disorder. study feasibility gene therapy PK deficiency, first constructed PK retrovirus pMNSM-hPK using human liver-type PK (LPK) cDNA obtained producer cell line E86/AmPK. using supernatant virus-producer cell, transduced NIH/3T3 cells, mouse leukemic cells (NFS60, FDCP-2), human leukemic cells (K562, HEL). expression human LPK enzyme activity ascertained retrovirally transduced NIH/3T3 cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated expression human LPK mRNA transduced cell line. Furthermore, bone marrow stem cells (c-kit+, Lin-, Thy-1lo) sorted fluorescence-activated cell sorting also transduced producer cells presence interleukin-3 interleukin-6, transplanted lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated expression human LPK mRNA peripheral blood hematopoietic organs day 30 day 135 bone marrow transplantation.
