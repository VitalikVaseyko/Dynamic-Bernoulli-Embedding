 Fatigue isolated gastrocnemius muscles R. pipiens leads marked increase proportion phosphofructokinase bound particulate fraction decrease binding lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine phosphokinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. proportion aldolase bound particulate fraction unaffected fatigue. pattern unchanged fatigued muscles extracted pH 6.5 rather 7.5. Thus, muscle fatigue leads opposite changes binding glycolytic enzymes.
