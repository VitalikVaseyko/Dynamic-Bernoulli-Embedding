 Ischemic injury heart associated death cardiomyocytes even decades research appropriate therapeutic intervention treat ischemic injury. microRNA miR-34a known induced cardiomyocytes following ischemic injury. Another hallmark ischemic injury impaired glycolysis. objective current study investigate effects short- long-term exposure hypoxia miR-34a expression apoptosis regulation key glycolysis metabolic enzymes. repeated short-term (30 min) burst hypoxia intermittent reoxygenation (30 min) well long-term (4 h) exposure hypoxia followed 6 h reoxygenation robustly induced miR-34a levels. Hypoxia induced changes cardiac permeability localization channel protein connexin 34 well induced apoptosis evident levels cleaved-caspase 3/7 impaired cell proliferation. Hypoxia also associated decreased expression key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase-1, hexokinase-2, glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Attenuation hypoxia-induced miR-34a anti-miR-34a antagomir, control antagomir, decreased miR-34a levels observed normoxia also inhibited apoptosis, potentially rescuing expression key glycolytic enzymes. Cumulatively, results establish therapeutic targeting miR-34a via antagomir might potent therapeutic mechanism treat ischemic injury heart.
