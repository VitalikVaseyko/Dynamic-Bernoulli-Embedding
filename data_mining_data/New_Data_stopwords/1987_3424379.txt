 Mechanical responses isolated atria (-)-isoproterenol activities myocardial pyruvate kinase citrate synthase, enzymes involved energy metabolism, assessed rats 7 days 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) treatment. Basal tension development electrically paced left atria significantly elevated doses TCDD (6.25, 25, 100 micrograms/kg) compared vehicle-treated rats unlimited access feed. basal rate spontaneously beating right atria significantly depressed rats receiving 100 micrograms/kg TCDD. left atria rats treated 100 micrograms/kg TCDD, maximal inotropic responses (-)-isoproterenol 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine enhanced degree. Right left atria rats receiving 100 micrograms/kg TCDD increased sensitivity chronotropic inotropic effects (-)-isoproterenol, respectively. augmented atrial effects caused TCDD secondary loss body weight pair-fed animals lost amount weight display responses. ratio heart ventricular mass body weight activities pyruvate kinase citrate synthase homogenates heart ventricular muscle affected TCDD treatment. Thus, overtly toxic doses TCDD rat depress mechanical function heart.
