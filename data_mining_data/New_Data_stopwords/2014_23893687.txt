 previous studies, constructed Bifidobacterium infantis thymidine kinase/nucleoside analogue ganciclovir (BI-TK/GCV) system, proven sustainable antitumor activity vivo bladder cancer rodent model. article, proteomic approach isobaric tags relative absolute quantification (iTRAQ) followed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry used understand molecular mechanisms system. iTRAQ identified 192 downregulated 210 upregulated proteins treatment BI-TK/GCV Sprague-Dawley rats. Downregulations proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (PKM2), hexokinase 1 (HXK-1), 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK-B), cell surface glycoprotein (CD146) bladder cancer treatment confirmed Western blot analysis validated immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, networks cancer proliferation associated PCNA, glycolysis associated PKM2, HXK-1, PFK-B, invasion associated CD146 illustrated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. study represents successful application iTRAQ technology reveal molecular mechanisms BI-TK/GCV treatment system provides theoretical support effectiveness successful treatment system.
