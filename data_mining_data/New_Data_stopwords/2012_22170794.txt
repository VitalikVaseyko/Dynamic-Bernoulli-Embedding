 OBJECTIVE: Fetuin associated insulin resistance metabolic syndrome. therefore explored role fetuin nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional intervention studies. METHODS: included 111 subjects histologically proven NAFLD 44 participated randomized, controlled trial metformin. One hundred thirty-one healthy subjects 13 subjects undergoing hepatic surgery metastatic cancer served controls. Main outcome variables circulating levels fetuin according presence NAFLD, hepatic gene expression fetuin key enzymes glucose lipid metabolism, effect metformin fetuin levels vivo vitro (HepG2 cells). RESULTS: Fetuin levels significantly higher NAFLD patients compared controls (324 +/- 98 vs 225 +/- 75 mg/l, P<0.001). NAFLD significant predictor elevated fetuin levels (beta=174 (95% confidence interval: 110-234)) independent body mass index, age, sex, fasting glucose, triglycerides. Hepatic fetuin mRNA levels correlated significantly hepatic mRNA levels key enzymes lipid (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) glucose (phosphoenol pyruvate kinase 1, glucose-6-phosphatase) metabolism. Plasma fetuin levels decreased significantly metformin treatment compared placebo (-40 +/- 47 vs 15 +/- 82 mg/l, P = 0.008). Metformin induced dose-dependent decrease fetuin secretion vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin levels elevated NAFLD. Hepatic expression fetuin correlated key enzymes glucose lipid metabolism. Metformin decreased fetuin levels vitro.
