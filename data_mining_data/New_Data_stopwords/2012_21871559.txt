 recent finding insulin increased expression glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLc) coincident increases GCL activity cellular glutathione (GSH) human brain microvascular endothelial cells (IHECs) suggests role insulin vascular GSH maintenance. Here, using IHECs stably transfected promoter-luciferase reporter vectors, found insulin increased GCLc promoter activity, required prerequisite increase decrease medium glucose. intact antioxidant response element-4 essential promoter activation, attenuated inhibitors PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling. Interestingly, low-glucose conditions promoter activation correlate increased GCLc expression GSH synthesis. Low tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBH) concentrations similarly mediated promoter activation, maximal activation dose decreased 10-fold insulin. Insulin-tBH coadministration abrogated low high glucose requirement promoter activation, suggesting possible ROS involvement. ROS production elevated low glucose without insulin; however, GSH increases inhibited tempol, suggesting ROS achieve threshold driving GCLc promoter activation de novo GSH synthesis. minor effect pyruvate also ruled major role hypoglycemia (+/-insulin)-induced metabolic stress GSH induction conditions.
