 Alterations hepatic glucose metabolism play key role development hyperglycemia observed type 2 diabetes. transcription factor c-Myc induces hepatic glucose uptake utilization blocks gluconeogenesis, examined whether hepatic overexpression c-myc counteracts insulin resistance induced high-fat diet. 3 months diet, control mice became obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, indicating developed insulin resistance. contrast, transgenic mice remained lean showed improved glucose disposal normal levels blood glucose insulin, indicating developed neither obesity insulin resistance. findings concomitant normalization hepatic glucokinase pyruvate kinase gene expression enzyme activity, led normalization intrahepatic glucose-6-phosphate glycogen content. liver control mice fed high-fat diet, expression genes encoding proteins control energy metabolism, sterol receptor element binding protein 1-c, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha, uncoupling protein-2, altered. contrast, liver transgenic mice fed high-fat diet, expression genes normal. results suggest c-myc overexpression counteracted obesity insulin resistance induced high-fat diet modulating expression genes regulate hepatic metabolism.
