 sustain increased growth, rapidly proliferating cells, tumour cells, undergo metabolic adaptations. recent years, mechanisms glycolysis activation key metabolic adaptation proliferating cells became topic intense research. Although phenomenon described 50 years ago Otto Warburg, molecular mechanisms remained elusive. recently, demonstrated expression specific glycolytic enzymes, namely PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) HK2 (hexokinase 2), occurs simultaneously glycolytic addiction cancer cells. PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/mTOR [mammalian (or mechanistic) target rapamycin] signalling pathway central signalling hub co-ordinating growth response growth factor signalling nutrient availability. surprisingly, found activated majority tumour cells. present article, discuss requirement different PI3K/mTOR downstream effectors metabolic adaptation liver cancer cells driven signalling pathway. provide evidence selective involvement mTOR target Akt2 tumoral growth. addition, PTEN (phosphatase tensin homologue deleted chromosome 10)-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines display up-regulation PKM2 expression Akt2-dependent manner, providing advantage cell proliferation anchorage-independent growth. data implications link metabolic action insulin signal transduction tumorigenesis, identifying Akt2 potential therapeutical target liver malignancies depending cancer genotype.
