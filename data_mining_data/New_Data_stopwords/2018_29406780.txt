 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity key component glucose/fatty acid cycle hypothesis regulation glucose uptake metabolism. investigated whether acute activation PDH muscle alleviate insulin resistance caused feeding animals high fat diet. importance PDH activity muscle glucose disposal insulin-stimulated conditions determined infusing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) high fat diet-fed (HFD) Wistar rats hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Acute DCA infusion alter glucose infusion rate, glucose disappearance hepatic glucose production decrease plasma lactate levels. DCA substantially increased muscle PDH activity however improve insulin-stimulated glucose uptake insulin resistant muscle high fat diet rats. DCA infusion increased flux pyruvate acetyl-CoA reduced glucose incorporation glycogen alanine muscle. Similarly, isolated muscle, DCA treatment increased glucose oxidation decreased glycogen synthesis without changing glucose uptake. results suggest although PDH activity controls conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA oxidation, little effect glucose uptake muscle insulin-stimulated conditions.
