 BACKGROUND: cancer cells partly mainly dependent glycolysis generate ATP (Warburg effect), inhibition glycolysis may slow proliferation kill them. MATERIALS METHODS: anti-tumor effect citrate, inhibitor phosphofructokinase, tested particularly chemoresistant MSTO-211H human mesothelioma cells. RESULTS: 3-day continuous exposure citrate led apoptotic cell death via mitochondrial pathway, associated reduction anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) Mcl-1 expression. However, citrate removed, remaining cells resumed proliferation. treatment cells non-cytotoxic dose cisplatin end citrate exposure led strong cytotoxicity, almost cells killed. CONCLUSION: Depletion ATP, diminution expression anti-apoptotic proteins inhibition hexokinase secondary inhibition phosphofructokinase citrate may explain cytotoxic activity molecule synergistic effect cisplatin.
