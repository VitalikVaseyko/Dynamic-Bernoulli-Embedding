 Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) known cardiac protective effects Akt activation. Akt acts 'central sensor' myocyte survival death; activity regulated multiple kinases including PI3K, mTORC2, PDK1 phosphatases including PTEN, PP2A PHLPPL. Based previous finding PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolishes H2S-induced Akt phosphorylation cardioprotection, accepted PI3K mediator H2S-induced Akt phosphorylation. However, LY294002 inhibits PI3K mTOR, PI3K recruits Akt membrane Akt phosphorylated Akt kinases. undertook series experiments evaluate role mTORC2, PDK1, PTEN, PP2A PHLPPL H2S-induced Akt phosphorylation cardioprotection, which, believe, investigated before. Hearts adult Sprague-Dawley rats isolated subjected (i) normoxia, (ii) global ischemia (iii) ischemia/reperfusion presence absence 50 microM H2S donor NaHS. Cardiac mechanical function lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assessed. hearts also Western analyzed end perfusion Akt panel appropriate Akt regulators targets. Hearts pretreated 50 microM NaHS improved function end reperfusion (Rate pressure product; 19+/-4x10(3) vs. 10+/-3x10(3) mmHg/min, p<0.05) reduced cell injury (LDH release 19+/-10 vs. 170+/-87 mU/ml p<0.05) compared untreated hearts. NaHS significantly increased phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, phospho-Bim Bcl-2 reperfused hearts (P<0.05). Furthermore using H9c2 cells demonstrate NaHS pretreatment reduces apoptosis following hypoxia/re-oxygenation. Importantly, PP242, specific mTOR inhibitor, abolished cardioprotection protein phosphorylation isolated heart reduced apoptotic effects H9c2 cells. Treating hearts NaHS reperfusion produced less cardioprotection similar mechanism. data suggest mTORC2 phosphorylation Akt key mediator H2S-induced cardioprotection I/R.
