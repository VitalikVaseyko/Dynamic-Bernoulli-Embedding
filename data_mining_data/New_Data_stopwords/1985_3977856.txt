 Branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex resolved component E1 E2-kinase subcomplex gel filtration presence 1 M-NaC1. Essentially original activity complex regained reconstitution component enzymes, reassociation rapid process. specific activities E1 E2 25.1 19.0 units/mg respectively. Non-phosphorylated active E1 approx. 6-fold higher affinity E2 phosphorylated E1. components branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex crossreact respective components pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. significance results tight association kinase E2 discussed.
