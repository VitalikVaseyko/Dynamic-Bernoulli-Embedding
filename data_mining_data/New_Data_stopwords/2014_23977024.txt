 Mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) central regulator cell proliferation cell growth; however, little known regulation mTOR expression transcriptional level. Here, provide evidences conserved human protein TBCK (TBC1 domain containing kinase) involved regulation mTOR signaling pathway. Depletion TBCK significantly inhibits cell proliferation, reduces cell size, disrupts organization actin, microtubule. Knockdown TBCK induces significant decrease protein levels components mTOR complex (mTORC), suppresses activity mTOR signaling, MAPK PDK1/Akt pathway. results show TBCK influences expression mTORC components transcriptional level. Thus, data suggest TBCK may play important role cell proliferation, cell growth actin organization possibly modulating mTOR pathway.
