 Pyruvate kinase acts allosteric enzyme, playing crucial role catalysis final step glycolytic pathway. study, site-specific mutagenesis tryptophan fluorescence quenching used probe catalytic allosteric mechanism rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Movement B domain found essential catalytic reaction. Rotation B domain opening cleft domains B induced binding activating cations allows substrates bind, whereas substrate binding shifts rotation B domain closure cleft. Trp-157 accounts differences tryptophan fluorescence signal without activating cations substrates. Trp-481 Trp-514 brought aqueous environment phenylalanine binding.
