 BACKGROUND: breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha(+)), harbor wt TP53, depend estrogen/ERK signalling proliferation, respond anti-estrogens. However, concomittant activation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/MEK pathway promotes resistance decreasing estrogen dependence. Previously, showed retroviral transduction mutant p53 R175H wt TP53 ERalpha(+) MCF-7 cells induces epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent proliferation, activation EGF receptor (p-EGFR) characteristics epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). PURPOSE: investigate whether p53 inactivation augments ERalpha(+) cell proliferation response restrictive estradiol, chemical MEK inhibition metabolic inhibitors. RESULTS: Introduction mutant p53 R175H lowered expression p53-dependent PUMA p21WAF1, decreased E-cadherin cytokeratin 18 associated EMT, increased % proliferating ERalpha(+)/Ki67 cells, diminishing estrogen dependence. cells also exhibited higher proliferation presence MEK-inhibitor UO126, reciprocally correlating preferential susceptibility pyruvate analog 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) without comparable response 2-deoxyglucose. p53 siRNA silencing electroporation wt TP53 MCF-7 cells also decreased estrogen dependence response MEK inhibition, also conferring susceptibility 3-BrPA. CONCLUSIONS: (a) ERalpha(+) breast cancer cells dysfunctional TP53 proliferate irrespective low estrogen chemical MEK inhibition likely increase metabolic consumption becoming increasingly susceptible 3-BrPA; (b) targeting pyruvate pathway may improve response endocrine therapy ERalpha(+) breast cancer p53 dysfunction.
