 biosynthesis enzyme pyruvate kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.40) Alcaligenes eutrophus (Hydrogenomonas eutropha) H 16 influenced carbon energy source. growth gluconate specific enzyme activity high acetate grown cells exhibited lower activities (340 55 mumoles/min-g protein, respectively). pyruvate kinase autotrophically grown cells purified 110-fold. enzyme characterized homotropic cooperative interactions substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, activators AMP, ribose 5-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate inhibitor ortho-phosphate. addition phosphate ATP caused inhibition case nonsigmoidal kinetics obtained. half maximal substrate saturation constant S0.5 phosphoenolpyruvate absence effectors 0.12 mM, presence 1 mM ribose-5-phosphate 0.07 mM, 9 mM phosphate 0.67 mM. corresponding Hill values 0.96, 1.1 2.75. ADP saturation curve hyperbolic even presence effectors, Km value 0.14 mM ADP. known intracellular metabolite concentrations A. eutrophus H 16 compared regulatory sensitivity enzyme, appeared conditions vivo inhibition ATP important regulation allosteric effectors.
