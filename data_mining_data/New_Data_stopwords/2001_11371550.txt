 Glucagon affects liver glucose metabolism mainly activating glycogen breakdown inhibiting pyruvate kinase, whereas possible effect glucose-6-phosphatase also suggested. Although target physiological importance liver glucose production never proven. using model liver cells, perifused dihydroxyacetone, show acute stimulation gluconeogenesis glucagon (10(-7) m) related significant inhibition pyruvate kinase dramatic activation hydrolysis glucose 6-phosphate. failed find acute change glucose-6-phosphatase activity glucagon, increase glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis abolished 21 degrees C; conversely effect pyruvate kinase affected temperature. activation glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis glucagon confirmed vivo, postabsorptive rats receiving constant infusion glucagon, combination 2-fold increase hepatic glucose production 60% decrease liver glucose 6-phosphate concentration. Besides description novel effect glucagon glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis temperature-sensitive mechanism, finding could represent important breakthrough understanding type II diabetes, glucose 6-phosphate proposed key molecule transcriptional effect glucose.
