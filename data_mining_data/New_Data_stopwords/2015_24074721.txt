 Metabolomics analysis used determine effect two well known, non-proprietary metabolic modulators, dichloroacetate allopurinol breast cancer cell lines. Dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor allopurinol, xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor, previously explored chemotherapeutics showing potential cancer subtypes time leading unexpected increase proliferation others. work, metabolic effects drugs, applied singly combination, explored three different breast cell lines including cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 MCF-7 normal control cell line, MCF-10A. metabolic changes induced drugs monitored (1)H NMR metabolic profiling. Analyses performed complete spectral data well quantified metabolic data intracellular fractions extracellular media leading determination significantly affected metabolites. effect dichloroacetate allopurinol apparent metabolic profile extracellular media. MCF-7 cells, dichloroacetate treatment dominant minor observed influence allopurinol combined treatment. MDA-MB-231 cells, allopurinol DCA lead metabolic shift allopurinol change dominating effect combined treatment. Results show power metabolomics tool fast molecular profiling drug effects cells. summary, treatments breast cancer cells DCA allopurinol result larger changes metabolites found extracellular medium intracellular pools.
