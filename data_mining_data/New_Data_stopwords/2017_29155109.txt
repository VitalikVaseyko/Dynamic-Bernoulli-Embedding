 Carbohydrate metabolism antioxidant defence system heart muscle Antarctic notothenioids Notothenia rossii Notothenia coriiceps evaluated response heat stress (8 degrees C) 144 h. N. rossii heart exhibited decreased glycolysis aerobic metabolism 12 h exposure 8 degrees C, anaerobiosis inhibited within 24 h. However, pathways stimulated 72 h 8 degrees C. consumption glucose-6-phosphate, derived hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) decreased N. rossii heart within 6 h 8 degrees C, subsequent increase 72 h. N. rossii muscle 8 degrees C, glycolysis stimulated within 2 h increase pyruvate kinase (PK), aerobic metabolism stimulated 144 h, together anaerobiosis. N. coriiceps heart 8 degrees C, glucose break HK decreased within 2 h subsequently increased 12 24 h. Increased glucose-6-phosphate consumption G6PDH occurred within 6 h 8 degrees C. N. coriiceps muscle 8 degrees C, glycolysis stimulated 2 6 h, subsequent inhibition within 24 h, indicated HK activity. Aerobic metabolism inhibited 72 144 h 8 degrees C inhibition citrate synthase (CS). Heat stress caused responses occasional transient antioxidant defence system species heart muscle, leading increased glutathione (GSH) decreased levels lipoperoxidation heart species. results obtained study heart muscles indicate heat stress 8 degrees C, N. rossii responsive N. coriiceps respect carbohydrate metabolism.
