 Several glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) radiolabelled [125I]iodination, conjugation 125I-labelled Bolton & Hunter reagent reductive [3H]methylation, degradative rates microinjection 3T3-L1 cells compared extracellular protein bovine serum albumin. Although albumin remains largely cytosolic recipient cells, glycolytic enzymes rapidly (less 30 min) become insoluble, measured detergent salt extractions. microinjected glycolytic enzymes appear form disulphide-linked aggregates, found cell fraction rich vimentin-containing intermediate filaments histones (nuclear-intermediate-filament fraction), degraded slowly lysosomal mechanism, judged effects inhibitors (NH4Cl, leupeptin, 3-methyladenine). 125I-labelled bovine serum albumin appears degraded rapidly non-lysosomally. Prolonged treatment (96 h) cultured cells leupeptin results accumulation pulse-labelled ([35S]methionine 24 h) endogenous cell proteins detergent-and salt-non-extractable residue, NH4Cl 3-methyladenine effect. findings terms interpretation experiments involving microinjection proteins study intracellular protein protein degradation autophagy.
