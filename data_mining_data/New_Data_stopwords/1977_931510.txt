 Pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.40) partially purified autotrophically heterotrophically grown Paracoccus denitrificans. organism grown heterotrophic conditions contains four times pyruvate kinase autotrophic conditions. enzyme isolated sources exhibited sigmoidal kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. apparent Km ADP PEP "autotrophic" enzyme 0.63 mM ADP 0.25 mM PEP. effect several low molecular weight metabolites pyruvate kinase activity investigated. Ribose-5-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate AMP stimulated reaction low ADP levels; stimulation brought alteration apparent Km ADP. pyruvate kinases differ response adenine nucleotides, preparations seem adenylate control. results discussed relation role pyruvate kinase regulatory enzyme P. denitrificans grown autotrophic heterotrophic conditions.
