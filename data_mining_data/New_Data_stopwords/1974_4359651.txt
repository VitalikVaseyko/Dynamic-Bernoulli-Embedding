 2-Keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG), intermediate hexuronate pathway Escherichia coli K-12, utilized sole carbon source strains derepressed specific KDG-uptake system. KDG metabolized pyruvate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate via inducible enzymes KDG-kinase 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphate-gluconate (KDPG) aldolase. However, another inducible pathway, KDG branch point, demonstrated. Genetic studies KDG degradative pathway reported paper led location KDG kinase-negative pleiotropic constitutive mutations. kdgK locus, presumably structural gene kinase, occurs min 69 co-transducible xyl. mutants, simultaneously constitutive uptake, kinase, aldolase, define kdgR locus min 36 co-transducible markers kdgA oldD. nature control exerted kdgR product, shown following. (i) Thermosensitive mutants kdgR locus inducible low temperature derepressed 42 C three operons-kdgT (transport system), kdgK, kdgA (KDPG aldolase). (ii) kdgR(+) allele dominant kdgR constitutive allele. (iii) deletion kdgA extending regulatory gene, kdgR, leads constitutive expression nondeleted operons-kdgT kdgK. properties demonstrate kdg regulon negatively controlled kdgR product. presumed differences operator promotor structures could explain strong decoordination, respectively, induction catabolic repression, three enzymes activities.
