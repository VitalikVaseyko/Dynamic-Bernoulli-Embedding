 Skeletal muscle fiber type composition one important factors influencing muscle growth meat quality. member myogenic transcription factors, myogenin (MyoG) required embryonic myoblast differentiation, expression MyoG continues mature muscle tissue adult animals, especially oxidative metabolic muscle, suggests MyoG may play extended role. Therefore, using MyoG gene transfer mice C2C12 myoblasts vivo vitro models, respectively, elected study role MyoG muscle fiber types oxidative metabolism using overexpression siRNA suppression strategies. overexpression MyoG DNA electroporation mouse gastrocnemius muscle significant effect fiber type composition upregulated mRNA expression (P<0.01) enzyme activity (P<0.05) oxidative succinic dehydrogenase (SDH). addition, downregulation activity glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, P<0.05) pyruvate kinase (PK, P<0.05) observed MyoG gene transfer mice. vitro experiments verified results obtained mice. Stable MyoG-transfected differentiating C2C12 cells showed higher mRNA expression levels myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform IIX (P<0.01) SDH (P<0.05), LDH mRNA attenuated. enzyme activities SDH (P<0.01) LDH (P<0.05) similarly altered mRNA level. MyoG knocked C2C12 cells, MyHC IIX expression (P<0.05) decreased, mRNA level (P<0.05) enzyme activity (P<0.05) SDH increased. Downregulating MyoG also increased activity glycolytic enzymes PK (P<0.05) hexokinase (HK, P<0.05). Based results, concluded MyoG barely changes MyHC isoforms, except MyHC IIX, differentiating myoblasts probably influences shift glycolytic metabolism towards oxidative metabolism vivo vitro. results contribute understand role MyoG skeletal muscle energy metabolism also help explore key genes regulate meat quality.
