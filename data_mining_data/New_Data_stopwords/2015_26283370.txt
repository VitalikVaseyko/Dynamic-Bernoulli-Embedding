 Aerobic glycolysis yeast cancer cells produces pyruvate beyond oxidative needs, paradox noted Warburg almost century ago. address question, reanalyzed extensive measurements (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy yeast glycolysis coupled pathways futile cycling glycogen trehalose synthesis (which refer glycogen shunt). yeast given large glucose load aerobic conditions, fluxes pathways adapt maintain homeostasis glycolytic intermediates ATP. glycogen shunt uses glycolytic ATP store glycolytic intermediates glycogen trehalose, generating pyruvate ethanol byproducts. conclusion supported studies yeast partial block glycogen shunt due cif mutation, found challenged glucose, yeast cells accumulate glycolytic intermediates ATP, ultimately leads cell death. control relative fluxes, critical maintain homeostasis, likely exerted enzymes pyruvate kinase fructose bisphosphatase. kinetic properties yeast PK mammalian PKM2, isoform found cancer, similar, suggesting mechanism may exist cancer cells, which, conditions, could explain excess lactate generation. general principle homeostasis metabolite ATP concentrations critical requirement metabolic function suggests enzymes pathways perform critical role could effective drug targets cancer diseases.
