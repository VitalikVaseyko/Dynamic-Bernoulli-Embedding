 Tumour cells secrete exosomes involved remodelling tumour-stromal environment promoting malignancy. mechanisms governing tumour exosome release, however, remain incompletely understood. show tumour cell exosomes secretion controlled pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), upregulated phosphorylated tumours. exosome secretion, phosphorylated PKM2 serves protein kinase phosphorylate synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP-23), turn enables formation SNARE complex allow exosomes release. Direct phosphorylation assay mass spectrometry confirm PKM2 phosphorylates SNAP-23 Ser95. Ectopic expression non-phosphorylated SNAP-23 mutant (Ser95-->Ala95) significantly reduces PKM2-mediated exosomes release whereas expression selective phosphomimetic SNAP-23 mutants (Ser95-->Glu95 Ser20-->Glu20) rescues impaired exosomes release induced PKM2 knockdown. findings reveal non-metabolic function PKM2, enzyme associated tumour cell reliance aerobic glycolysis, promoting tumour cell exosome release.
