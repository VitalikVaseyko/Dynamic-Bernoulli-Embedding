 Lung cancer leading cause cancer-related death men women. Protein biomarkers lung cancer investigated using expression proteins lung cancer cell line (A549) compared normal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis A549 MRC-5 cells carried followed protein identification using nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. proteins expressed A549 cells phosphoproteins lamin AC 70 kDa, aldehyde dehydrogenase, alpha-enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase peroxiredoxin. Moreover, proteins expressed A549 cells heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1, nuclear corepressor KAP1, transketolase cytokeratin 18. Furthermore, phosphoprotein chaperonin 60 highly expressed A549 cells. known function protein interactions protein conformation. expression protein cells may result abnormalities protein conformation lead early stage cancer. proteins may used biomarker lung cancer early detection clinical prognosis.
