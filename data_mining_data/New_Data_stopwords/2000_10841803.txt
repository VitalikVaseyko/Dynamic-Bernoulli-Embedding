 optimization series anilide derivatives (R)-3,3, 3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid inhibitors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) described started N-phenyl-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide 1 (IC(50) = 35 +/- 1.4 microM). found small electron-withdrawing groups ortho position anilide, i.e., chloro, acetyl, bromo, increased potency 20-40-fold. oral bioavailability compounds series optimal (as measured AUC) anilide substituted 4-position electron-withdrawing group (i.e., carboxyl, carboxyamide, sulfoxyamide). N-(2-Chloro-4-isobutylsulfamoylphenyl)-(R)-3,3, 3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionamide (10a) inhibits PDHK primary enzymatic assay IC(50) 13 +/- 1.5 nM, enhances oxidation [(14)C]lactate (14)CO(2) human fibroblasts, lowers blood lactate levels significantly 2.5 5 h oral doses low 30 micromol/kg, increases ex vivo activity PDH muscle, kidney, liver, heart tissues. However, contrast sodium dichloroacetate (DCA), PDHK inhibitors lower blood glucose levels. Nevertheless, effective increasing utilization disposal lactate could utility ameliorate conditions inappropriate blood lactate elevation.
