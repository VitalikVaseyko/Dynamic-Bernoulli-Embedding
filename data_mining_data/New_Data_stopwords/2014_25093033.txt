 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) autoimmune disease effective therapy pathology currently unavailable. previously reported oral administration Naja naja atra venom (NNAV) anti-inflammatory immune regulatory actions. speculated NNAV may therapeutic effects MRL/lpr SLE mice. Twelve-week-old MRL/lpr mice received oral administration NNAV (20, 40, 80 mug/kg) Tripterygium wilfordii polyglycosidium (10 mg/kg) daily 16 weeks. effects NNAV SLE manifestations, including skin erythema, proteinuria, anxiety-like behaviors, assessed visual inspection Multistix 8 SG strips open field test, respectively. pathology spleen kidney examined H&E staining. changes autoimmune antibodies cytokines determined ELISA kits. results showed NNAV protected manifestation SLE, including skin erythema proteinuria. addition, although apparent histological change found liver heart MRL/lpr SLE mice, NNAV reduced levels glutamate pyruvate transaminase creatine kinase. Furthermore, NNAV increased serum C3 reduced concentrations circulating globulin, anti-dsDNA antibody, inflammatory cytokines IL-6 TNF-alpha. NNAV also reduced lymphadenopathy renal injury. results suggest NNAV may therapeutic values treatment SLE inhibiting autoimmune responses.
