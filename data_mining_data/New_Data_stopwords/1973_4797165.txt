 1. improved purification procedure brain-type creatine kinase ox smooth muscle described. 2. Michaelis constants show characteristic dependence concentration second substrate: derived constants compared enzyme ox brain. 3. Inhibition iodoacetamide gives biphasic curve total extent reaction depends enzyme concentration. rate inhibition pH8.6 affected creatine plus MgADP range simple anions. Addition creatine plus MgADP plus either NO(3) (-) Cl(-) ions affords 71.5 44% protection respectively. ADP could replaced 2-deoxy-ADP alphabeta-methylene ADP, XDP, IDP, GDP CDP. Nucleotides protect would act substrates. 4. Difference-spectra measurements support interpretation addition NO(3) (-) ions enzyme-creatine-MgADP complex causes conformational changes enzyme accompanying formation stable quaternary enzyme-creatine-NO(3) (-)-MgADP complex simulates intermediate stage transphosphorylation reaction. However, enzyme structure partially destabilized quaternary-complex formation. IDP apparently fails act substrate cannot induce necessary conformational change. behaviour compared rabbit skeletal muscle creatine kinase. 5. pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle, anions activate absence activating cation either inhibit effect presence. 6. activation inhibition competitive respect substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, curved double-reciprocal plots obtained. results may interpreted terms co-operatively induced conformational changes, supported difference-spectra measurements. However, Hill coefficient 1 significantly altered. 7. Inhibition lactate plus pyruvate less additive, indicating bind site enzyme, whereas lactate plus NO(3) (-) additive, indicating binding separate sites. inferred quaternary enzyme-pyruvate-NO(3) (-)-MgADP complex could form, evidence obtained suggest possessed special properties comparable found creatine kinase. implications findings unidirectional nature mechanism pyruvate kinase discussed. 8. Lactate alpha-hydroxybutyrate could act instead pyruvate form stable quaternary complex, although activate K(+)-free enzyme. former inhibits K(+)-activated enzyme. activating cation lowers Michaelis constant phosphoenolpyruvate tightens specificity binding site.
