 Orexins hypothalamic neuropeptides regulate food intake, energy homeostasis, reward system sleep/wakefulness states. purpose study investigate effects orexin glucose metabolism human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Hep3B, determine possible mechanisms. Hep3B cells incubated different concentrations orexin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) vitro presence absence orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) inhibitor (SB334867), Akt inhibitor (PF-04691502) mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (temsirolimus). Subsequently, OX1R protein expression, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, glucose uptake, mRNA expression lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), lactate generation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity measured. activity phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling also determined. OX1R expressed hepatoma tissues Hep3B cells. Stimulation Hep3B cells orexin resulted dose-dependent increase GLUT1 expression glucose uptake, associated activation PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Further, orexin increased PDHB expression PDH enzyme activity, decreased LDHA, PDK1 mRNA levels lactate generation independent PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. results demonstrated orexin directed cellular metabolism towards mitochondrial glucose oxidation rather glycolysis. findings provide functional evidence metabolic actions orexin hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
