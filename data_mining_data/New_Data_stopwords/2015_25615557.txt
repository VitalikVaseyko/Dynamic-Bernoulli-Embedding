 Vibrational signatures human breast tissue (invasive ductal carcinoma invasive lobular carcinoma) used identify, characterize discriminate structures normal (noncancerous) cancerous tissues confocal Raman imaging, Raman spectroscopy IR spectroscopy. important differences normal cancerous tissues found regions characteristic vibrations carotenoids, fatty acids, proteins, interfacial water. Particular attention paid role played unsaturated fatty acids derivatives. K-means clustering basis analysis followed PCA PLSDA employed analyze Raman spectroscopic maps human breast tissue statistical analysis samples (82 patients, 164 samples). Raman maps successfully identify regions carotenoids, fatty acids, proteins. intensities, frequencies profiles average Raman spectra differentiate biochemical composition normal cancerous tissues. paper demonstrates Raman imaging reached clinically relevant level regard breast cancer diagnosis applications. sensitivity specificity obtained directly PLSLD cross validation equal 90.5% 84.8% calibration 84.7% 71.9% cross-validation respectively.
