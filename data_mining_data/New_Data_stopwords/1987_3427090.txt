Upon elimination glycolytic component, measured Pi----ATP rates displayed linear dependence MVO (micromoles consumption rate) slope 2.36 +/- 0.15 (N = 8, standard error mean). linear relationship expected rate determined CST net rate ATP synthesis oxidative phosphorylation process, case slope must equal P:O ratio. ATP----Pi rates rate:MVO ratios measured multiple-site saturation transfer method two MVO2 levels equal corresponding Pi----ATP rates rate:MVO ratios obtained absence glycolytic contribution. following conclusions drawn studies: (1) unless glycolytic contribution ATP equilibrium Pi exchange inhibited specifically shown exist, myocardial Pi equilibrium ATP exchange due oxidative phosphorylation cannot studied NMR; (2) moderate MVO2 levels, reaction catalyzed two glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-phosphoglycerate kinase near equilibrium; (3) ATP synthesis mitochondrial H+-ATPase occurs unidirectionally (i.e., reaction far equilibrium); (4) "operative" P:O ratio intact myocardium conditions significantly less canonically accepted value 3.
