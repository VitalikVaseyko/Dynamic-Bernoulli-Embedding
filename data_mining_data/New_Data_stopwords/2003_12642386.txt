 (1) study compared molecular signalling elicited rexinoids, selective retinoid X receptor (RXR)-activators, several organs (i.e. liver, kidney, heart) hepatocytes various species. (2) RXR plays pivotal role hetero-dimerization partner members class II subset nuclear receptors regulate transcription numerous target genes, following chemical activation. Several selective activators currently used treat hyperlipidaemia (fibrates), type II diabetes (glitazones), skin disorders (retinoic acid). Although therapeutic pathways fully elucidated, receptor activation considered pre-requisite efficacy. Therefore RXR, accepts numerous dimeric partners, considered worthwhile pharmacological target. (3) analysed number biochemical molecular responses rexinoids given orally mice. results showed prominent involvement peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha) majority observed hepatic renal regulations abolished PPARalpha-knockout animals. Therefore documented species-specificity rexinoid actions reproduced rat primary hepatocyte cultures cultures rabbit human origin. Conversely, established regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) gene heart, rexinoids, independent PPARalpha expression. (4) results support obligatory expression active, although quiescent, PPARalpha sustain subset relevant regulations attributable rexinoids liver kidney. cardiac molecular signalling unveiled alternate transduction pathway therefore opens new prospects therapeutic potential rexinoids.
