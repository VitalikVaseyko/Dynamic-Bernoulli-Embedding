 Using lyophilized cryostat sections liver activities alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase measured using Lowry technique first layer hepatocytes adjacent terminal hepatic venules residual parenchymal perivenous zone acinus normally fed adult male Wistar rats. Alanine aminotransferase homogeneously distributed two areas measured (ratio hepatocytes adjacent terminal hepatic venules/residual parenchyma perivenous zone: 1.05). Enzyme activities lactate dehydrogenase significantly lower hepatocytes adjacent terminal hepatic venules (ratio: 0.65) pyruvate kinase significantly higher (ratio: 1.12) residual parenchyma perivenous zone indicating liver cell heterogeneity zone liver acinus.
