 ADAR1 RNA-specific adenosine deaminase edits RNA sequences. demonstrated previously different ADAR1 isoforms induced acute inflammation. show mouse ADAR1 isoforms differentially localized cellular compartments localization controlled several independent signals. Nuclear import full-length ADAR1 predominantly regulated nuclear localization signal C terminus (NLS-c), consists bipartite basic amino acid motif plus last 39 residues ADAR1. Deletion NLS-c causes truncated ADAR1 protein retained cytoplasm. addition sequence pyruvate kinase causes cytoplasmic protein localized within nucleus. localization nuclear ADAR1 determined dynamic balance nucleolar binding activity nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) middle protein exporting activity nuclear exporter signal (NES) near N terminus. NoLS consists typical monopartite cluster basic residues followed third double-stranded RNA-binding domain. signals act independently; however, NES function completely silenced NLS-c regulatory motif within catalytic domain NoLS deleted. Thus, intracellular distribution various ADAR1 isoforms determined NLS-c, NES, NoLS, regulatory motif.
