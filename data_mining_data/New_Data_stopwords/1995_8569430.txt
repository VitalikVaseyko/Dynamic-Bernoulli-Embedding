 Three series experiments demonstrated sesame seed lignans cause significant elevation alpha-tocopherol content rats. Experiment 1, 20% sesame seed (with negligible amount alpha-tocopherol) supplementing 10 (low), 50 (normal), 250 (high) mg/kg alpha-tocopherol diets (protein fat concentrations diets adjusted 200 110 g/kg, respectively) caused significant increase alpha-tocopherol blood tissue rats. Experiment 2, groups rats fed five different diets: vitamin E-free control diet, low alpha-tocopherol diet, three low alpha-tocopherol diets supplemented 5, 10, 15% sesame seed. Changes lipid peroxides liver, red blood cell hemolysis, pyruvate kinase activity, indices vitamin E deficiency, examined. indices high low alpha-tocopherol diet, whereas supplementation even 5% sesame seed suppressed indices completely caused significant increase alpha-tocopherol content plasma liver. Experiment 3, two diets containing sesame lignan (sesaminol sesamin) low alpha-tocopherol tested. Results sesame lignan-fed groups comparable observed sesame seed-fed groups shown Experiment 2. experiments indicate sesame seed lignans enhance vitamin E activity rats fed low alpha-tocopherol diet cause marked increase alpha-tocopherol concentration blood tissue rats fed alpha-tocopherol-containing diet sesame seed lignans.
