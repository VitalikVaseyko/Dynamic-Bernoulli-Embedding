 Glucose modulate transcription many genes, particularly encoding enzymes liver metabolism. transcriptional effect glucose indirect, mediated vivo hormonal variations, especially increase insulin decrease glucagon secretion. Whereas transcription glucokinase gene, example, stimulated insulin without aid glucose, transcriptional activation glycolytic lipogenic genes hepatocytes requires presence glucose insulin. role insulin activation genes seems mainly stimulate glucokinase synthesis, thus permit glucose phosphorylation. cells hexokinase activity constitutive, glucose-dependent activation genes require insulin and, addition, produced nonmetabolisable analog, 2-deoxyglucose. hepatocytes, insulin effect glucose-dependent activation L-pyruvate kinase gene reproduced fructose low concentrations. Fructose probably acts fructose 1-phosphate dependent deinhibition glucokinase activity. glucose/carbohydrate element identified L-type pyruvate kinase spot 14 gene promoters. able bind, vitro, transcriptional factors MLTF/USF family could act cooperation tissue-specific contiguous elements, HNF4 binding site L-type pyruvate kinase gene.
