 Expression Aspergillus nigerbeta-glucosidase gene, BGL1, Nicotiana tabacum plants (cv. Xanthi) profound effect volatile emissions intact crushed leaves. BGL1 expressed control cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter targeted cytoplasm, cell wall, lytic vacuole (LV), chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subcellular localization confirmed gold immunolabelling, followed transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Significant beta-glucosidase activity observed transgenic plants expressing BGL1 cell wall, LV ER. Compared controls, intact transgenic leaves found emit increased levels 2-ethylhexanol, determined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis headspace volatiles. Plants expressing BGL1 cell wall (Tcw) emitted trans-caryophyllene non-transgenic controls, whereas plants expressing BGL1 ER (Ter) LV (Tvc) emitted cembrene non-transgenic controls. Volatiles released crushed transgenic leaves collected solid-phase microextraction (SPME) polydimethylsiloxane fibre distinctly enhanced. Significant increases linalool, nerol, furanoid cis-linalool oxide, 4-methyl-1-pentanol, 6-methyl-hept-5-en-2-ol 2-ethylhexanol detected transgenic plants compared wild-type controls. 3-Hydroxyl-beta-ionone levels increased crushed Tcw Ter leaves, undetectable Tvc leaves. addition glucoimidazole, beta-glucosidase inhibitor, abolished increased emission volatiles. results indicate expression fungal beta-glucosidase gene different subcellular compartments potential affect emission plant volatiles, thereby modify plant-environment communication aroma agricultural products.
