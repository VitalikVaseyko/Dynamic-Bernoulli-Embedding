 Self-rooted, 10-month-old, uniform tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Huangguanyin] plants supplied 17 weeks 0, 40, 80, 160, 400, 1000muM phosphorus (P) investigate effects P supply root citrate malate release, concentrations malate citrate activities acid-metabolizing enzymes leaves roots. Root malate release accumulation induced 0 40muM P, root citrate release accumulation induced 0muM P. Phosphorus-deficiency-induced malate citrate release coincided higher concentrations root malate citrate. higher concentrations malate citrate accompanied increased activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase (PEPP), citrate synthase (CS) NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) decreased activities pyruvate kinase (PK), NADP-ME NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH) roots. contrast roots, malate accumulated leaves response 0muM P, change observed citrate levels. P-deficiency-induced leaf malate accumulation coincided increased activities NADP-ME, NAD-ME PK. Overall, P-deficiency-induced changes organic acid (OA) metabolism differed roots leaves. high tolerance tea plants P-deficiency might involved two major processes: (a) increasing availability P inducing root release OA anions; (b) improving ability use P efficiently inducing bypass enzymes involved tissue P economy.
