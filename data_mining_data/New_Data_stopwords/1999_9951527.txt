 Modeling metabolic pathway dynamics requires detailed kinetic equations enzyme level. particular, kinetic equations must account metabolite effectors contribute significantly pathway regulation vivo. Unfortunately, kinetic rate laws available literature consider effectors simultaneously, much kinetic information exists qualitative semiquantitative form. article, present strategy incorporate information kinetic equation. strategy uses fuzzy logic-based factors modify algebraic rate laws account partial kinetic characteristics. parameters introduced fuzzy factors optimized use hybrid simplex genetic algorithms. resulting model provides flexible form simulate various kinetic behaviors. kinetic models suitable pathway modeling without complete enzyme mechanisms. Three enzymes Escherichia coli central metabolism used examples: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; pyruvate kinase I. Results show that, fuzzy logic-augmented models, kinetic data much better described. particular, complex behavior, allosteric inhibition, captured using fuzzy rules. resulting models, even though provide additional physical meaning enzyme mechanisms, allow model incorporate semiquantitative information metabolic pathway models.
