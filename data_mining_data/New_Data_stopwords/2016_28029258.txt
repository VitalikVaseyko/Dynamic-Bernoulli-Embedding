 describe potentiality new liposomal formulation enabling positron emission tomography (PET) magnetic resonance MR() imaging. bimodality achieved coupling (68)Ga-based radiotracer bilayer magnetic liposomes. order enhance targeting properties obtained permanent magnetic field, sugar moiety added lipid formulation. Two new phospholipids synthesized, one specific chelator (68)Ga (DSPE-PEG-NODAGA) one glucose moiety (DSPE-PEG-glucose). liposomes produced according fast safe process, high radiolabeling yield. MR PET imaging performed mice bearing human glioblastoma tumors (U87MG) iv injection. accumulation liposomes solid tumor evidenced MR imaging amount evaluated vivo ex vivo according PET imaging. efficient magnetic targeting achieved new magnetic liposomes.
