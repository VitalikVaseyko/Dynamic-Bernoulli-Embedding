 130 muscle biopsies taken gastrocnemius 82 patients different degrees peripheral vascular disease (PVD) 19 normal controls histochemical analysis, 30 patients 7 controls biochemical analysis "aerobic" "anaerobic" enzymes. results showed gastrocnemius patients PVD adapt increasing "aerobic" potential previously suggested. Histochemical studies showed cross-sectional area Type 1 Type 2 muscle fibres became smaller age-matched controls presence PVD, cases biopsies legs confirmed trend greater limbs increasing evidence PVD. also evidence suggest decrease absolute capillary numbers per muscle fibre. biochemical assays confirmed decreased levels aerobic enzymes increasing evidence PVD judged ankle systolic pressure, patients intermittent claudication showed evidence increased anaerobic enzyme levels comparison normal controls rest pain. Patients PVD adapt ischaemia/anoxia increasing aerobic capability, show signs muscle atrophy probably due reduced mobility. Training regimes may benefit patients intermittent claudication reversing changes.
