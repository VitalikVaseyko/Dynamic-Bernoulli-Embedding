 BACKGROUND: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common causes congenital hemolytic anemia. describe case HS defective PK activity initially misdiagnosed PK deficiency. METHODS: Hematologic investigation, SDS-PAGE analysis red cell membrane proteins sequencing PKLR gene performed. RESULTS: molecular characterization PKLR gene showed heterozygous mutation 994G > (Gly332Ser) associated promoter substitution -148C > T, whose role pathophysiology PK deficiency debated. investigations revealed spectrin deficiency; family study demonstrated hemolysis exclusively attributable HS. CONCLUSIONS: present case pinpoints need extensive family investigations correctly diagnose chronic hemolytic anemia, particular molecular characterization fully explain clinical phenotype.
