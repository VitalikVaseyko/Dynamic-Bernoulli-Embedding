 Thermoplasma acidophilum thermoacidophilic archaebacterium occupying paradoxical place phylogenetic trees (phenotypically thermoacidophile phylogenetically classifies methanogens). better understand phylogeny, pyruvate kinase organism investigated molecular marker. enzyme purified native M(r) 250,000. consists four, apparently identical subunits M(r) 60,000. remarkable kinetic differences found thermophilic enzyme mesophilic counterparts greater thermostability. amino acid composition determined partial sequencing done.
