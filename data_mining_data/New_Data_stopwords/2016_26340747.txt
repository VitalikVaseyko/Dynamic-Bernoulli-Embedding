 BACKGROUND: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) also called sleeping sickness infectious disease humans caused extracellular protozoan parasite. disease, left untreated, results 100% mortality. Currently available drugs full severe drawbacks fail escape fast development trypanosoma resistance. Due similarities cell metabolism cancerous tumors trypanosoma cells, current registered drugs HAT also tested cancer chemotherapy. demonstrate first time simple ester, ethyl pyruvate, comprises properties. RESULTS: current study covers efficacy corresponding target evaluation ethyl pyruvate T. brucei cell lines using combination biochemical techniques including cell proliferation assays, enzyme kinetics, phasecontrast microscopic video imaging ex vivo toxicity tests. shown ethyl pyruvate effectively kills trypanosomes probably net ATP depletion inhibition pyruvate kinase (Ki = 3.0+/-0.29 mM). potential ethyl pyruvate trypanocidal compound also strengthened fast acting property, killing cells within three hours post exposure. demonstrated using video imaging live cells well concentration time dependency experiments. importantly, ethyl pyruvate produces minimal side effects human red cells known easily cross blood-brain-barrier. makes promising candidate effective treatment two clinical stages sleeping sickness. Trypanosome drug-resistance tests indicate irreversible cell death low incidence resistance development experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: results present ethyl pyruvate safe fast acting trypanocidal compound show inhibits enzyme pyruvate kinase. Competitive inhibition enzyme found cause ATP depletion cell death. Due ability easily cross blood-brain-barrier, ethyl pyruvate could considered new candidate agent treat hemolymphatic well neurological stages sleeping sickness.
