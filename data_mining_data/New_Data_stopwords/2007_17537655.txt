 investigated effect copper liver key enzymes anaerobic glucose metabolism (hexokinase, HK; phosphofructokinase, PFK; pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) well pentose pathway (glycose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH) fish Prochilodus lineatus. fish acclimated either 20 degrees C 30 degrees C pH 7.0, transferred water pH 4.5 8.0, exposed 96 h-CL(50) copper concentrations. Copper accumulation liver higher fish acclimated 20 degrees C maintained water pH 8.0. Three-way analysis variance revealed significant effect temperature enzymes, significant effect pH enzymes except PK, significant effect copper PFK, LDH pH 4.5 20 degrees C and, 30 degrees C, PFK PK pH 4.5 8.0, HK pH 4.5 G6PDH pH 8.0. significant interactions treatments many enzymes. changes suggest activity enzymes question modified change ambient water. least 30 degrees C, overall reduction glycolytic enzyme activities copper-exposed fish seems reduce energy availability via glucose metabolism, thereby contributing enhance copper toxic effects.
