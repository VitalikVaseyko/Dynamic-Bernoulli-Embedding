 feasibility continuous production proteins chemostat cultures Bacillus subtilis investigated. expression system consisting bacterium B. subtilis BR151 carrying plasmid p602/19 used. plasmid contains cat (chioramphenicol acetyltrans-ferase) gene downstream strong vegetative T5 promoter. found that, dilution rate 0.2 h(-1) production relatively high levels CAT protein (about 4% ofcellular protein) sustained. But, experiments higher dilution rate 0.4 h(-1) unproductive high acidformation washout. Combination low cell yield, results excessive acid formation, low dilution rate led low volumetric CAT productivity. recent work nonrecombinant cells, demonstrated uptake small amounts citrate significantly reduces entirelyeliminates acid formation. superior performance presence ofcitrate hypothesized, based strong experimental evidence, result reduction glycolysis flux sequence events leading reduction pyruvate kinase phosphof- ructokinase activities, regulatory enzymes glycol-ysis. study, demonstrated cofeeding glucose citrate substantially reduces theorganic acid formation significantly increases recombinant culture productivity. combination high specific CAT activity cell density resulted total six- tenfold higher culture productivitywhen citrate glucose cometabolized glucose carbon source.
