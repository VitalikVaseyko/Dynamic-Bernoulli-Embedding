 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)delta considered therapeutic target diabetes obesity enhancement fatty acid oxidation. present study aimed characterize effects PPARdelta agonists insulin resistance whole body, muscle liver. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Wistar rats C57BL/J6 mice fed high fat diet (HF) treated PPARdelta agonists NNC61-5920 GW501516. effects insulin resistance evaluated hyperinsulinaemic clamp glucose tolerance tests combined glucose tracers. KEY RESULTS: HF rats, 3 weeks treatment NNC61-5920 reduced glucose infusion rate (by 14%, P < 0.05) glucose disposal muscle (by 20-30%, P < 0.01) hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Despite increased mRNA expression carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 uncoupling protein 3 muscle, plasma muscle triglyceride levels raised (P < 0.01). Similar metabolic effects observed extended treatment NNC61-5920 GW501516 6 weeks. However, HF mice treated NNC61-5920 improved plasma lipid profile, glucose tolerance insulin action muscle. HF rats mice, NNC61-5920 treatment attenuated hepatic insulin resistance decreased expression stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, fatty acid translocase protein CD36 lipoprotein lipase liver. CONCLUSIONS IMPLICATIONS: PPARdelta agonists exacerbated insulin resistance HF rats contrast beneficial effects metabolic syndrome HF mice. opposing metabolic consequences result different effects lipid metabolism insulin sensitivity skeletal muscle two species.
