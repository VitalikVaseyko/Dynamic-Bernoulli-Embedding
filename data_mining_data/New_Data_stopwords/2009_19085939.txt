 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency rare disease important cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. disease caused mutations PKLR gene shows marked variability clinical expression. report molecular characterization 38 PK-deficient patients 35 unrelated families. Twenty-nine different PKLR mutations detected, 15 reported first time. Two novel deletions reported: c.142_159del18 largest in-frame deletion described thus far predicts loss six consecutive amino acids (p.Thr48_Thr53del) N-terminal domain red blood cell PK. deletion removes nearly 1.5 kb genomic DNA sequence (c.1618+37_2064del1477) one large deletional mutants PKLR. addition, 13 novel point mutations identified: one nonsense mutant, p.Arg488X, 12 missense mutations, predicting substitution single amino acid: p.Arg40Trp, p.Leu73Pro, p.Ile90Asn, p.Gly111Arg, p.Ala154Thr, p.Arg163Leu, p.Gly165Val, p.Leu272Val, p.Ile310Asn, p.Val320Leu, p.Gly358Glu, p.Leu374Pro. used three-dimensional (3D) structure recombinant human tetrameric PK evaluate protein structural context affected residues. addition, selected patients red blood cell PK antigen levels measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collectively, results provided us rationale observed enzyme deficiency contribute better understanding genotype-to-phenotype correlation PK deficiency well enzyme's structure function.
