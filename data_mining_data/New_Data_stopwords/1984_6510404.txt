 red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, KM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thermostability properties studied patients acute leukemias. acquired PK defect found patients acute myeloid leukemia, normal acute non-myeloid leukemia enzyme kinetic tests. PK abnormality expressed 17 patients deficient PK activity, 15 patients decreased enzyme thermostability, 11 patients altered PK affinity ADP.
