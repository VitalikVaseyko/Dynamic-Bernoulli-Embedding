 effect alkaline denaturation structural functional characteristics rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) investigated using enzymatic activity measurements combination optical methods circular dichroism, fluorescence, ANS binding. critical pH, 10.5, PK exists intermediate state (alkaline unfolded state) predominant secondary structure along tertiary interactions strong binding hydrophobic dye ANS. intermediate retains enzymatic activity corresponds dimeric state molecule. pH 10.5, sudden fall spectral properties enzymatic activity occurs suggesting dissociation molecule followed unfolding high pH. Addition salts NaCl, KCI, Na2SO4 alkali-induced state induces secondary tertiary structure level equivalent native tetramer (salt-induced state). Chemical- temperature-induced unfolding alkali-induced state well salt-induced refolded state PK reveal presence intermediate conformations unfolding pathway. unfolding transition curves noncoinciding noncooperative along ANS binding intermediate concentrations denaturants unfolding. observations presented paper suggest native pyruvate kinase tetramer dissociates active dimer around pH 10.5 inactive monomer attaining completely unfolded monomeric conformation.
