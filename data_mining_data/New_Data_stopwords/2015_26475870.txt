 Tetracyclines, class antibiotics target bacterial translation, commonly used research inducible gene expression using Tet-ON/Tet-OFF systems. However, tetracycline-inducible systems carry risk. Given mitochondria "bacterial" ancestry, antibiotics also target mitochondrial translation impair mitochondrial function. Indeed, treatment doxycycline-a tetracycline derivative-disturbs mitochondrial proteostasis metabolic activity, induces widespread gene-expression changes. Together, affects physiology well-established model systems ranging cultured cells simple organisms mice plants. changes observed doxycycline doses widely used regulate gene expression. light findings, bearing mind conserved role mitochondria metabolism whole organism homeostasis, caution use tetracyclines experimental approaches. use newly developed tetracycline-based systems sensitive could alternative; however, even overt mitochondrial toxicity detected, widespread changes gene expression may sensitize cells intended tetracycline-controlled loss gain function, thereby introducing "two-hit model." highly relevant cancer research, mitochondrial metabolism holds central position reallocation nutrients biomass production known Warburg effect.
