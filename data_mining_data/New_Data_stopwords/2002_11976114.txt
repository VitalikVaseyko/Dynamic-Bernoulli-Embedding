 new approach modulating gene expression, based randomization promoter (spacer) sequences, developed. method applied chromosomal genes Lactococcus lactis shown generate libraries clones broad ranges expression levels target genes. one example, overexpression achieved introducing additional gene copy phage attachment site chromosome. resulted series strains phosphofructokinase activities 1.4 11 times wild-type activity level. example, pfk gene cloned upstream gusA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase, resulting operon structure genes transcribed common promoter. show linear correlation expressions two genes, facilitates screening mutants suitable enzyme activities. second example, show method applied modulating expression native genes chromosome. constructed series strains expression las operon, containing genes pfk, pyk, ldh, modulated integrating truncated copy pfk gene. Importantly, modulation affected activities three enzymes extent, enzyme activities ranging 0.5 3.5 times wild-type level obtained.
