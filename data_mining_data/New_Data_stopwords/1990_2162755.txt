 Hormonal regulation hepatic gluconeogenic pathway flux brought phosphorylation/dephosphorylation control gene expression several key regulatory enzymes. Regulation cAMP-dependent phosphorylation occurs level pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (6PF-1-K)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-2,6-P2ase). latter unique bifunctional enzyme catalyzes synthesis degradation fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), activator 6PF-1-K inhibitor Fru-1,6-P2ase. bifunctional enzyme homodimer whose activities regulated cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation single NH2-terminal seryl residue/subunit, results activation Fru-2,6-P2ase inhibition PF-1-K reactions. Hormone-mediated changes phosphorylation state bifunctional enzyme responsible acute regulation Fru-2,6-P2 levels. 6PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase thus provides switching mechanism glycolysis gluconeogenesis mammalian liver. Pyruvate kinase regulated phosphorylation allosteric effectors. Fru-1,6-P2, allosteric activator, also inhibits cAMP-dependent enzyme phosphorylation, steady-state concentration indirectly determined level Fru-2,6-P2. Therefore, acute regulation pyruvate kinase bifunctional enzyme provide coordinated control pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate Fru-6-P/Fru-1,6-P2 substrate cycles. Fru-2,6-P2 system also subject complex multihormonal long-term control regulation 6 PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase gene expression. Glucocorticoids major factor turning gene liver, insulin also positive effector. cAMP prevents effects glucocorticoids insulin. Although Fru-2,6-P2 plays key role regulation carbon flux gluconeogenic pathway, regulation flux depends several factors regulation key enzymes whose importance varies depending dietary hormonal status animal. Molecular cloning cDNA encoding PF-2-K/Fru-2,6-P2ase elucidated structure permitted analysis evolutionary origin well tissue distribution control gene expression. rat liver skeletal muscle isoforms arose alternative splicing single gene. muscle form differs liver form NH2-terminal cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site. hepatic enzyme subunit consists 470 amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
