 Neisseria gonorrhoeae opacity-associated (Opa) proteins family outer membrane proteins involved gonococcal adherence invasion human cells. wanted identify additional roles Opa infectious process used yeast two-hybrid system identify human epithelial cell proteins interact Opa proteins. Although system used successfully identify many types interacting proteins, used screen human cell cDNA library binding partners prokaryotic outer membrane protein. Therefore, also interested exploring versatility yeast two-hybrid system identifying bacteria-host interactions. Using OpaP strain F62SF bait, screened HeLa cell cDNA library Opa-interacting proteins (OIPs). identified five different OIPs, designated OIP1-OIP5, two homologous human proteins--thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein (TRIP6) pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PK). studies presented here, investigated interaction Opa proteins PK depth. Opa-PK interactions confirmed vitro vivo assays independent yeast two-hybrid system. Escherichia coli expressing six different Opa proteins gonococcal strain FA1090 bound PK Opa-negative E. coli vitro binding assays. Using anti-PK antibody fluorescence microscopy, showed human epithelial cell PK co-localizes intracellular Opa+ gonococci E. coli expressing Opa proteins. Using mutant N. gonorrhoeae unable grow pyruvate lactate, appears intracellular pyruvate essential gonococcal growth survival. results suggest novel mechanism bacterial pathogenesis, i.e. requirement direct molecular interaction host metabolic enzyme (PK) acquisition essential intracellular carbon source growth substrate (pyruvate). results demonstrate yeast two-hybrid system valuable tool identifying biologically relevant interactions bacteria host proteins, providing valuable leads investigations novel mechanisms bacterial pathogenesis.
