 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) progressive vascular disease high mortality rate. characterized occlusive vascular remodeling due pro-proliferative antiapoptotic environment wall resistance pulmonary arteries (PAs). Proliferating cells exhibit cancer-like metabolic switch mitochondrial glucose oxidation suppressed, whereas glycolysis up-regulated major source adenosine triphosphate production. multifactorial mitochondrial suppression leads inhibition apoptosis downstream signaling promoting proliferation. report increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), inhibitor mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, gatekeeping enzyme glucose oxidation) PAs human PAH compared healthy lungs. Treatment explanted human PAH lungs PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) ex vivo activated PDH increased mitochondrial respiration. 4-month, open-label study, DCA (3 6.25 mg/kg b.i.d.) administered patients idiopathic PAH (iPAH) already approved iPAH therapies led reduction mean PA pressure pulmonary vascular resistance improvement functional capacity, range individual responses. Lack ex vivo clinical response associated presence functional variants SIRT3 UCP2 predict reduced protein function. Impaired function proteins causes PDK-independent mitochondrial suppression pulmonary hypertension mice. first-in-human trial mitochondria-targeting drug iPAH demonstrates PDK druggable target offers hemodynamic improvement genetically susceptible patients, paving way novel precision medicine approaches disease.
