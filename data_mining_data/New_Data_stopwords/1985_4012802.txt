 delayed wasting syndrome similar induced 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) observed male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed 3,3', 4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene (TCAOB) 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB). slow growth period, treatment animals (25 mg/kg, i.p., 2 doses per week) exhibited starvation-like syndrome characterized reduced food intake, dramatic loss body weight subsequent death. Although growth major organs treatment animals affected, thymus appeared severely atrophied. growth kinetics earlier phase analyzed using serially-killed rats receiving TCAOB. addition, TCAOB found markedly depress specific activity (mumol/min/g wet liver) glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase liver. Significant changes levels cytochrome P-450, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase malic enzyme liver also observed.
