 Periodate-oxidized ADP (dialdehyde-ADP) inactivates rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) combines irreversibly enzyme. inactivation first-order respect dialdehyde-ADP follows saturation kinetics, indicating enzyme first forms reversible complex inactivator. Low Mg2+ concentrations stimulate rate inactivation, higher concentrations protective effect. ADP ATP, especially presence Mg2+, protect strongly inactivation, phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate less effective. Dialdehyde-ADP substrate, acts competitive inhibitor ADP, KI 4.5 mM. analog somewhat lower affinity enzyme Mg-ADP, Kd 1.2 mM. Based kinetic data, shown one molecule reagent must combine per enzyme active site order inactivate enzyme. Incorporation [14-C]dialdehyde-ADP enzyme treatment data Tsou plot shows 6-7 residues per subunit react modifier, two essential activity. evidence presented concluded: (1) dialdehyde-ADP behaves affinity label rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase; (2) inactivator binds probably lysine residues near active site, forming morpholine-like structures, (3) enzyme possesses two modifiable groups essential activity, reaction one sufficient cause total loss activity.
