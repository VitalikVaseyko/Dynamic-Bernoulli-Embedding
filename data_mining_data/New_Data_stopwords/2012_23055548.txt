 CONTEXT: cancer cells, Warburg effect defined avid consumption glucose glycolytic pathway concomitant lactate production, even aerobic conditions. CASE: report 64-yr-old woman referred institution pancytopenia hypoglycemia. Physical examination demonstrated hepatosplenomegaly petechiae. clinical manifestation neuroglycopenia, despite serum glucose 26 mg/dl (1.4 mmol/liter) serum lactate 28.5 mmol/liter (normal range, 0.5-3.4 mmol/liter). Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Staging (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed increased FDG avidity enlarged spleen absent FDG uptake brain. Despite dextrose infusions 30 g/h, increase serum glucose, paradoxical increase serum lactate. Immunochemotherapy improved hematological metabolic abnormalities. Follow-up FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed decrease splenic avidity increase brain FDG avidity. patient refused chemotherapy died 1 wk discharge. METHODS: Literature review cases lymphoma lactic acidosis, without hypoglycemia, demonstrated combinations occurred multiple categories B- T-cell lymphoma. difference mortality rate (75%) without (74%) concomitant hypoglycemia. CONCLUSION: case represents exaggerated Warburg effect, "hyper-warburgism," characterized excessive lactate production overwhelming glucose consumption. speculate decreased brain FDG uptake, despite lack neuroglycopenic symptoms, supports hypothesis lactate served fuel brain, thus protecting hypoglycemia.
