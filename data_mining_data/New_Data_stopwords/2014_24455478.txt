 INTRODUCTION: dysregulation pH cancerous cells solid tumors able create unique milieu favor progression, invasion metastasis well chemo-/immuno-resistance traits solid tumors. Bioelements involved pH dysregulation provide new set oncotargets, inhibition may result better clinical outcome. METHODS: study impacts pH dysregulation, investigated tumor development progression relation Warburg effect, glycolysis formation aberrant tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: upregulation glucose transporter GLUT-1 several enzymes involve glycolysis exacerbates phenomenon. accumulation lactic acids cancer cells provokes upregulation several transport machineries (MCT-1, NHE-1, CA IX H(+) pump V-ATPase) resulting reinforced efflux proton extracellular fluid. deviant event makes pH settled 7.4 6.6 respectively cancer cells cytoplasm extracellular fluid within tumor microenvironment, return triggers secretion lysosomal components (various enzymes acidic milieu pH 5) cytoplasm. anomalous phenomena make tumor microenvironment (TME) exposed cocktail various enzymes acidic pH, upon extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeled even deformed, resulting emergence complex viscose TME high interstitial fluid pressure. CONCLUSION: seems pH dysregulation able remodel various physiologic functions make solid tumors become much invasive metastatic. also cause undesired resistance chemotherapy immunotherapy. Hence, cancer therapy needs reinforced using specific inhibitors bioelements involved pH dysregulation TME solid tumors.
