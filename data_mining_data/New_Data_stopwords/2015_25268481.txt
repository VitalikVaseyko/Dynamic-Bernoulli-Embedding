 Metabolic pathways complex dynamic systems whose response perturbations environmental challenges governed multiple interdependencies enzyme properties, reactions rates, substrate levels. Understanding dynamics arising network greatly enhanced construction computational model embodies properties respective system. models aim incorporate mechanistic details cellular interactions mimic temporal behavior biochemical reaction system usually require substantial knowledge kinetic parameters allow meaningful conclusions. Several approaches suggested overcome severe data requirements kinetic modeling, including use approximative kinetics Monte-Carlo sampling reaction parameters. work, employ probabilistic approach study response complex metabolic system, central metabolism lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis, subject perturbations brief periods starvation. Supplementing existing methodologies, show possible acquire detailed understanding control properties corresponding metabolic pathway model directly based experimental observations. particular, delineate role enzymatic regulation maintain metabolic stability metabolic recovery periods starvation. shown feedforward activation pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphate qualitatively alters bifurcation structure corresponding pathway model, indicating crucial role enzymatic regulation prevent metabolic collapse low external concentrations glucose. argue similar probabilistic methodologies help understanding dynamic properties small-, medium- large-scale metabolic networks models.
