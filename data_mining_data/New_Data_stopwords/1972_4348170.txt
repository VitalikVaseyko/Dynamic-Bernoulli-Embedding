 1. Extracts human peripheral blood lymphocytes contained histone phosphatase catalysed release P(i) phosphorylated whole thymus histone. 2. Stimulation phosphatase obtained concentrations KCl NaCl 75mm, MgCl(2); CaCl(2) inhibited enzymic activity. 3. absence MgCl(2), phosphoenol-pyruvate inhibited histone phosphatase activity; inhibition could partially reversed adding MgCl(2) assays. 4. Lymphocyte extracts contained protein kinase activity maximally stimulated 1mum-cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate) 0.1mm-cyclic GMP (guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate). 5. Incubation enzyme histone absence ATP MgCl(2) resulted dissociation enzyme lower-molecular-weight species stimulated cyclic AMP. effect could prevented ATP MgCl(2) present reaction mixtures histone enzyme allowed interact. 6. Cyclic AMP also dissociated kinase lower-molecular-weight species. 7. presence 1mum-AMP, half-maximal activities obtained 0.92mm-MgCl(2), 6.0mum-ATP 0.23mg whole thymus histone/ml.
