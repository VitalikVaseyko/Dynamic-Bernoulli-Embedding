 Denervated muscle generally regarded insulin resistant ability insulin stimulate glucose transport glycogen synthesis impaired. Previous studies indicate insulin resistance muscles likely due defect postreceptor site signaling pathway. glucose transport cells reported linked changes diacylglycerol (DAG) protein kinase C (PKC), investigated effect denervation content synthesis DAG activity distribution PKC soleus muscle. DAG content muscles denervated 24 h 40% greater control muscles. associated two- threefold increase percentage total PKC activity membrane associated, significant change total PKC activity, suggesting increase PKC activity vivo. Studies glucose disposition confirmed stimulation glycogen synthesis insulin and, lesser extent, 2-deoxyglucose uptake impaired denervation. However, stimulation insulin glucose incorporation DAG lipids two- threefold greater denervated control muscles, conversion glucose lactate pyruvate glucose oxidation CO2 unchanged. results reveal dichotomy effects denervation various actions insulin, insulin resistance hyperresponsiveness occurring different pathways glucose metabolism. also reveal potential mechanism elevation muscle DAG denervation. results support direct link DAG-PKC glucose transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
