 mechanisms underlying pathogenesis constitutively active tyrosine kinase nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) expressing anaplastic large cell lymphoma completely understood. show using integrated phosphoproteomic metabolomic strategy NPM-ALK induces metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis, increased lactate production, biomass production. metabolic shift mediated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) phosphorylation tumor-specific isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) Y105, resulting decreased enzymatic activity. Small molecule activation PKM2 expression Y105F PKM2 mutant leads reversal metabolic switch increased oxidative phosphorylation reduced lactate production coincident increased cell death, decreased colony formation, reduced tumor growth vivo xenograft model. study provides comprehensive profiling phosphoproteomic metabolomic consequences NPM-ALK expression reveals novel role ALK regulation multiple components cellular metabolism. studies show PKM2 novel substrate ALK plays critical role mediating metabolic shift toward biomass production tumorigenesis.
