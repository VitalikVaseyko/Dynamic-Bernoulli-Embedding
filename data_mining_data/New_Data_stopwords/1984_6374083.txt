 lower mean cell age prolonged 51Cr-labeled red cell survival top layer centrifuged red blood cells suggest product may reduce blood requirements patients transfusion-dependent anemias. prospective clinical trial, compared effect regular administration young red cells associated use conventional frozen cells. Six patients thalassemia major received 192 units young red cells prepared single donor units whole blood using IBM 2991 Cell Processor. mean transfusion requirement maintain hemoglobin level greater 9.0 gm/dl 110 +/- 17 ml RBC/kg year young cell transfusions, comparison 130 +/- 20 131 +/- 23 ml RBC/kg conventional frozen cells administered years young cell trial, respectively. Blood requirements individual patients reduced 8% 24% (mean 15.8%); hemoglobin level remained constant. Although young cells consistent quality prepared regularly clinical setting little difficulty, cost product high effect transfusion requirements less predicted studies vitro labeling experiments.
