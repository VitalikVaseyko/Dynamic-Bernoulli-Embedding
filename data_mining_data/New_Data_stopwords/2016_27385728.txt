 STUDY QUESTION: inhibitor DNA-binding protein 2 (ID2) mediator transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced Warburg-like effect seen peritoneum women endometriosis? SUMMARY ANSWER: TGF-beta1-induced changes metabolic phenotype peritoneal mesothelial cells women endometriosis mediated ID2 pathway. KNOWN ALREADY: TGF-beta1 induces metabolic conversion glucose lactate via aerobic glycolysis (the 'Warburg effect') peritoneum women endometriosis, increased expression transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-1alpha). ID proteins transcriptional targets TGF-beta1. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Expression ID2 investigated luteal phase peritoneal biopsies women regular menstrual cycles, without endometriosis (n = 8-10 group) quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) immunohistochemistry. ID2 mRNA expression primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) immortalized mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) assessed qRT-PCR (n = 6). effects TGF-beta1 ID2 siRNA HIF-1alpha mRNA expression lactate secretion assessed using qRT-PCR colorimetric lactate assay. MAIN RESULTS ROLE CHANCE: ID2 localized peritoneal mesothelial stromal cells women without endometriosis. ID2 mRNA expression lower peritoneum adjacent endometriosis lesions compared distal sites (P < 0.01). Exposure HPMC MeT-5A cells physiological concentrations TGF-beta1 decreases ID2 mRNA expression (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, respectively, versus control). ID2 knockdown increases HIF-1alpha mRNA expression (P < 0.01) lactate secretion (P < 0.05 versus scrambled control) degree exposure TGF-beta1. LIMITATIONS, REASONS CAUTION: Primary human cell cultures cell line used study, thus results may fully represent situation vivo. results also replicated using larger number samples. WIDER IMPLICATIONS FINDINGS: Novel therapeutics target TGFbeta/ID pathway offer potential role treatment endometriosis. LARGE SCALE DATA: None.
