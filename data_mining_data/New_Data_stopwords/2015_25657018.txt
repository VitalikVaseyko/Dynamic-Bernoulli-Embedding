 Adenocarcinoma, type non-small cell lung cancer, frequently diagnosed lung cancer leading cause lung cancer mortality United States. well documented biochemical changes occur early transition normal cancer cells, extent alterations affect tumorigenesis adenocarcinoma remains largely unknown. Herein, describe application mass spectrometry multivariate statistical analysis one largest biomarker research studies date aimed distinguishing metabolic differences malignant nonmalignant lung tissue. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry used measure 462 metabolites 39 malignant nonmalignant lung tissue pairs current former smokers early stage (stage IA-IB) adenocarcinoma. Statistical mixed effects models, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis network integration, used identify key cancer-associated metabolic perturbations adenocarcinoma compared nonmalignant tissue. Cancer-associated biochemical alterations characterized (i) decreased glucose levels, consistent Warburg effect, (ii) changes cellular redox status highlighted elevations cysteine antioxidants, alpha- gamma-tocopherol, (iii) elevations nucleotide metabolites 5,6-dihydrouracil xanthine suggestive increased dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase xanthine oxidoreductase activity, (iv) increased 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine levels indicative reduced purine salvage increased de novo purine synthesis, (v) coordinated elevations glutamate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine suggesting increased protein glycosylation. present study revealed distinct metabolic perturbations associated early stage lung adenocarcinoma, may provide candidate molecular targets personalizing therapeutic interventions treatment efficacy monitoring.
