 Activated alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M*) signals predominantly cell surface GRP78 (CS-GRP78) promote proliferation survival cancer cells; however, molecular mechanism remains obscure. c-MYC essential transcriptional regulator controls cell proliferation. hypothesize alpha2M*/CS-GRP78-evoked key signaling events required transcriptional activation c-MYC target genes. Activation CS-GRP78 alpha2M* requires ligation GRP78 primary amino acid sequence (Leu(98)-Leu(115)). stimulation alpha2M*, CS-GRP78 signaling activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) induce phosphorylation PLK1, turn induces c-MYC transcription. demonstrate PLK1 binds directly c-MYC promotes transcriptional activity phosphorylating Ser(62) Moreover, activated c-MYC recruited E-boxes target genes FOSL1 ID2 phosphorylating histone H3 Ser(10) addition, targeting carboxyl-terminal domain CS-GRP78 mAb suppresses transcriptional activation c-MYC target genes impairs cell proliferation. work demonstrates alpha2M*/CS-GRP78 acts upstream regulator PDK1/PLK1 signaling axis modulate c-MYC transcription target genes, suggesting therapeutic strategy targeting c-MYC-associated malignant progression.
