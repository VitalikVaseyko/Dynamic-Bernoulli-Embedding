 Altered cellular metabolism fundamental adaptation cancer rapid proliferation result growth factor overstimulation. review different pathways involving metabolic alterations cancers including aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, de novo fatty acid synthesis, serine glycine metabolism. Although oncoproteins, c-MYC, HIF1alpha p53 major drivers metabolic reprogramming, post-transcriptional regulation microRNAs (miR) also plays important role finely adjusting requirement key metabolic enzymes underlying metabolic reprogramming. also combine literature data miRNAs potentially regulate 40 metabolic enzymes responsible metabolic reprogramming cancers, additional miRs computational prediction. analyses show that: (1) metabolic enzyme frequently regulated multiple miRs, (2) confidence scores prediction algorithms might useful help narrow functional miR-mRNA interaction, might worth experimental validation. combining known predicted interactions oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) (c-MYC, HIF1alpha p53), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), 40 metabolic enzymes, regulatory miRs established one first reference maps miRs oncogenic TFs regulate metabolic reprogramming cancers. combined network shows glycolytic enzymes linked miRs via p53, c-MYC, HIF1alpha, whereas genes serine, glycine one carbon metabolism regulated via c-MYC, well regulatory organization cannot observed investigating individual miRs, TFs, target genes.
