 Yeast cells defective GGS1 (FDP1/BYP1) gene unable adapt fermentative metabolism. glucose added derepressed ggs1 cells, growth arrested due overloading glycolysis sugar phosphates eventually leads depletion phosphate cytosol. Ggs1 mutants lack glucose-induced regulatory effects investigated far. reduced hexokinase activity ggs1 strains deleting gene HXK2 encoding hexokinase PII. double mutant ggs1 delta, hxk2 delta grew glucose. agreement idea inability ggs1 mutants regulate initiation glycolysis causes growth deficiency. However, ggs1 delta, hxk2 delta double mutant still displayed high level glucose-6-phosphate well rapid appearance free intracellular glucose. consistent previous model suggesting involvement GGS1 transport-associated sugar phosphorylation. Glucose induction pyruvate decarboxylase, glucose-induced cAMP-signalling, glucose-induced inactivation fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-induced activation potassium transport system, deficient ggs1 mutants, restored deletion HXK2. However, ggs1 delta ggs1 delta, hk2 delta mutant lack detectable trehalose trehalose-6-phosphate synthase activity. Trehalose undetectable even ggs1 delta strains strongly reduced activity protein kinase normally causes high trehalose content. data fit recent cloning GGS1 subunit trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
