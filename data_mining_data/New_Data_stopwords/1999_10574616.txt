 Nmi initially identified yeast two-hybrid interaction N-Myc also interacts c-Myc, Max, Fos, several transcription factors, including signal transducer activator transcription (Stat) proteins. Nmi interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 25% amino acid identity IFN-inducible protein IFP 35. found homology consists novel domain approximately 90-92 amino acids (aa) repeated tandem protein. region, termed Nmi/IFP 35 domain (NID), important subcellular localization Nmi. Full-length Nmi protein deletion constructs containing single NID localized cytoplasm, amino-terminal Nmi fragments 92 aa containing neither NID nuclear. Fusion amino-terminal end Nmi pyruvate kinase, exclusively cytoplasmic protein, results cytoplasmic fusion protein, suggesting amino-terminal end Nmi contain classic nuclear localization signal (NLS). Fusion amino-terminal end Nmi green fluorescent protein (GFP), normally found nuclear cytoplasmic compartments, alter GFP distribution, whereas fusion single NID GFP targets fusion cytoplasm. Fusion nuclear localization signal (NLS) full-length Nmi NID repeats targets hybrid nucleus, suggesting strong NLS dominant cytoplasmic localization function NID. NID may mediate cytoplasmic localization full-length Nmi protein NID-NID protein interactions demonstrated yeast two-hybrid assay, immunoprecipitation, presence Nmi high molecular weight protein complex. results suggest Nmi composed modular structure amino-terminal domain separated rest protein nuclear. carboxy-terminal two thirds protein composed two NID mediate cytoplasmic localization full-length protein.
