 Investigation cancer cell metabolism revealed variability metabolic profiles among different types tumors. According classical model cancer bioenergetics, malignant cells primarily use glycolysis major metabolic pathway produce large quantities lactate suppressed oxidative phosphorylation even presence ample oxygen. referred aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect. However, growing number recent studies provide evidence cancer cells depend glycolysis, and, moreover, oxidative phosphorylation essential tumorigenesis. Thus, necessary consider distinctive patterns cancer metabolism specific case. Chemoresistance cancer cells associated decreased sensitivity different types antitumor agents. Stimulation apoptosis major strategy elimination cancer cells, therefore activation mitochondrial functions direct impact mitochondria destabilize appears important approach induction cell death. Consequently, design combination therapies using acclaimed cytotoxic agents directed induction apoptosis metabolic agents affecting cancer cell bioenergetics prospective strategies antineoplastic therapy.
