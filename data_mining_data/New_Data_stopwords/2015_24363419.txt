 Global warming intensifying interest physiological consequences temperature change ectotherms, still relatively poor understanding effects temperature early life stages. study determined embryonic temperature (TE) affects development activity metabolic enzymes swimming muscle zebrafish. Embryos developed successfully hatching (survival >/= 88%) 22 32 degrees C, suffered sharp increases mortality outside range. Embryos incubated hatching control TE (27 degrees C) near extremes successful development (22 32 degrees C) next raised adulthood control conditions 27 degrees C. Growth trajectories hatching altered 22 degrees C 32 degrees C TE groups compared 27 degrees C TE controls, growth slowed 3 months age groups. Maximal enzyme activities cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citrate synthase (CS), hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase (HOAD), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) measured across range assay temperatures (22, 27, 32 36 degrees C) adults TE group acclimated 27 32 degrees C. Substrate affinities (Km) also determined COX LDH. adult fish acclimated 27 degrees C, COX PK activities higher 22 degrees C 32 degrees C TE groups 27 degrees C TE controls, temperature optimum COX activity higher 32 degrees C TE group 22 degrees C TE group. Warm acclimation reduced COX, CS and/or PK activities 22 32 degrees C TE groups, possibly compensate thermal effects molecular activity. response occur 27 degrees C TE controls, instead increased LDH HOAD activities. Warm acclimation also increased thermal sensitivity (Q10) HOAD cool temperatures across TE groups. conclude temperature experienced early development persistent impact energy metabolism pathways acclimation capacity later life.
