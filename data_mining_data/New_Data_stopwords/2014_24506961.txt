 OBJECTIVE: explore differentially expressed proteins normal cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) squamous cervical carcinoma (SCC) tissues differential proteomics, provide basis studies CIN molecular pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis treatment. METHODS: Uterine cervical tissue specimens patients treated August 2008 September 2009 Department Oncology Beijing Obstetrics Gynecology Hospital collected. samples normal cervix (n = 9), CIN (n = 23, CIN = 7, CIN II = 8, CIN III = 8) SCC (n = 7). 2-D DIGE DeCyder software used detect differentially expressed protein-spots. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS used analyze differentially expressed proteins. Collect normal cervix(n = 20), CIN (n = 60) SCC (n = 20), immunohistochemistry (IHC) Western blot used verify differentially expressed proteins S100A9 (S100 calcium-binding protein A9) , eEF1A1 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1-alpha-1) PKM2 (pyruvate kinase isozymes M2) among normal cervix, CIN SCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry used detect differentially expressed S100A9, eEF1A1 PKM2 cervical tissues. RESULTS: 2D gel electrophoresis images high resolution good repeatability obtained. Forty-six differentially expressed proteins (27 up-regulated 19 down-regulated) selected among normal, CIN, SCC, 26 proteins successfully identified. Immunohistochemistry showed protein S100A9 mainly expressed cytoplasm, positive expression rate 20.0% normal cervical mucosa, 70.0% CIN, 100.0% squamous cell carcinoma, significant difference (P = 0.006). eEF1A1 mainly expressed cell plasma. positive expression rate 70.0% normal cervix, 73.3%in CIN 60.0% SCC tissues, non-significant difference (P = 0.758). protein PKM2 mainly expressed cell nuclei. positive expression rate 100.0% normal cervix, 93.3% CIN 75.0% SCC tissues, showing difference close statistical significance (P = 0.059) them. results Western blot similar immunohistochemical examination. CONCLUSIONS: differentially expressed proteins among normal cervix, CIN SCC. S100A9, eEF1A1 PKM2 may become candidate markers early diagnosis cervical cancer new targets therapy. also provides basis studies pathogenetic mechanism CIN developing cervical cancer.
