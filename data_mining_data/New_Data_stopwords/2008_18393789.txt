 Cells obtain energy oxygen-dependent pathway oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) oxygen-independent pathway glycolysis. Since OXPHOS efficient generating ATP glycolysis, recognized presence oxygen results activation OXPHOS inhibition glycolysis (Pasteur effect). However, known many years cancer cells non-malignant proliferating cells activate glycolysis presence adequate oxygen levels (aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect). Accumulating evidence suggests persistent activation aerobic glycolysis tumor cells plays crucial role cancer development; inhibition increased glycolytic capacity malignant cells may therefore represent key anticancer strategy. Although important knowledge gained last years growing field research, basis Warburg effect still remains poorly understood. communication analyzes cancer cells switch OXPHOS glycolysis presence adequate oxygen levels, cells manage avoid inhibition glycolysis induced oxygen. Several strategies drugs may interfere glycolytic metabolism cancer cells also shown. information may help develop anticancer approaches may clinical relevance.
