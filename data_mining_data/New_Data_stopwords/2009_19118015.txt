 assess potential tumor-associated, alternatively spliced gene products source biomarkers biological fluids, analyzed large data set mass spectra derived plasma proteome mouse model human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. MS/MS spectra interrogated novel splice isoforms using nonredundant database containing exhaustive three-frame translation Ensembl transcripts gene models ECgene. integrated analysis identified 420 distinct splice isoforms, 92 match previously annotated mouse protein sequence. chose seven novel variants validation reverse transcription-PCR. results concordant proteomic analysis. seven novel peptides successfully amplified pancreas specimens wild-type mutant mice. Isotopic labeling cysteine-containing peptides tumor-bearing mice wild-type controls enabled relative quantification proteins. Differential expression tumor-bearing control mice notable peptides novel variants muscle pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, proteoglycan 4, minichromosome maintenance, complex component 9, high mobility group box 2, hepatocyte growth factor activator. results show that, mouse model human pancreatic cancer, novel differentially expressed alternative splice isoforms detectable plasma may source candidate biomarkers.
