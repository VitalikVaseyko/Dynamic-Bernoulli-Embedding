 Colorectal cancer metastasis liver major cause cancer-related death; however, genes pathways govern metastatic colonization event remain poorly characterized. Here, using large-scale vivo RNAi screen, identified liver red blood cell pyruvate kinase (PKLR) driver metastatic liver colonization. PKLR expression increased liver metastases well primary colorectal tumors patients metastatic disease. Evaluation murine liver colonization model revealed PKLR promotes cell survival tumor core conditions high cell density oxygen deprivation increasing glutathione, primary endogenous antioxidant. PKLR negatively regulated glycolytic activity PKM2, major pyruvate kinase isoenzyme known regulate cellular glutathione levels. Glutathione critical metastasis, determined rate-limiting enzyme glutathione synthesis, GCLC, becomes overexpressed patient liver metastases, promotes cell survival hypoxic cell-dense conditions, mediates metastatic liver colonization. RNAi-mediated inhibition glutathione synthesis impaired survival multiple colon cancer cell lines, pharmacological targeting metabolic pathway reduced colonization primary patient-derived xenograft model. findings highlight impact metabolic reprogramming within niche metastases progress suggest clinical potential targeting pathway colorectal cancer.
