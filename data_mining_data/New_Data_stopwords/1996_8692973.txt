 Hyperglycemia common feature diabetes mellitus. results decrease glucose utilization liver peripheral tissues increase hepatic glucose production. Glucose phosphorylation glucokinase initial event glucose metabolism liver. However, glucokinase gene expression low diabetic animals. Transgenic mice expressing P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase/glucokinase chimeric gene generated study whether return expression glucokinase liver diabetic mice might prevent metabolic alterations. contrast nontransgenic mice treated streptozotocin, mice transgene previously treated streptozotocin showed high levels glucokinase mRNA enzyme activity liver, associated increase intracellular levels glucose 6-phosphate glycogen. liver mice also showed increase pyruvate kinase activity lactate production. Furthermore, normalization expression genes involved gluconeogenesis ketogenesis liver production glucose ketone body hepatocytes primary culture observed streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice. Thus, glycolysis induced gluconeogenesis ketogenesis blocked liver diabetic mice expressing glucokinase. associated normalization blood glucose, ketone bodies, triglycerides, free fatty acids even absence insulin. results suggest expression glucokinase diabetes might new approach normalization hyperglycemia.
