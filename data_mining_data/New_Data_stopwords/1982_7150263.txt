 1. following measured adipose-tissue pieces, obtained 7-9 month-old sheep, tissue pieces maintained tissue culture 24 h: rates synthesis glucose fatty acids, acylglycerol glycerol, pyruvate lactate; rate glucose oxidation CO(2); rate glucose oxidation via pentose phosphate pathway; activities hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase ATP citrate lyase; intra- extra-cellular water content; concentration various metabolites ATP, ADP AMP. 2. proportion glucose carbon converted various products sheep adipose tissue differs markedly observed rat adipose tissue. 3. general increase rate glucose utilization adipose-tissue pieces maintenance tissue culture; largest changes seen rates glycolysis fatty acid synthesis glucose. increases paralleled increase pyruvate kinase activity. change activities enzymes measured, although net flux enzymes increased. 4. Incubation fresh adipose-tissue pieces 2-6h led increase affinity pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate. 5. rate pyruvate production glycolysis greater activity pyruvate dehydrogenase tissue. 6. results suggest pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase important roles restricting utilization glucose carbon fatty acid synthesis sheep adipose tissue.
