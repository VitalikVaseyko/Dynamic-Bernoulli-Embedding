 Duplicate groups rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) (mean weight 11 g) given 40 weeks one four partially purified diets either adequate low selenium vitamin E both. Weight gains trout given dually deficient diet significantly lower trout given complete diet diet deficient Se. mortalities occurred pathology seen exudative diathesis dually deficient trout. significant interaction two nutrients respect packed cell volume malondialdehyde formation vitro NADPH-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation system. Tissue levels vitamin E Se decreased low levels trout given diets lacking nutrients. plasma significant effect dietary vitamin E Se concentration. Glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) activity liver plasma significantly lower trout receiving low dietary Se independent vitamin E intake. ratios hepatic GSH peroxidase activity measured cumene hydroperoxide hydrogen peroxide treatments. confirms absence Se-independent GSH peroxidase activity trout liver. Se deficiency lead compensatory increase hepatic GSH transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) activity; values essentially treatments. Plasma pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity increased significantly trout deficient nutrients. thought due leakage enzyme muscle may indicative incipient (subclinical) muscle damage.
