 Megadose vitamin C (Vc) one enduring alternative treatments diverse human diseases deeply engrafted popular culture. Preliminary studies 1970s described potent effects Vc prolonging survival patients terminal cancer, claims later criticized. improved knowledge pharmacokinetics Vc recent reports using cancer cell lines renewed interest subject. Despite findings, using Vc adjuvant anticancer therapy remains questionable, among things proper mechanistic understanding. Here, show Warburg effect triggered activation hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway greatly enhances Vc-induced toxicity multiple cancer cell lines, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cancer cells. HIF increases intracellular uptake oxidized Vc transcriptional target glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), synergizing uptake reduced form sodium-dependent Vc transporters. resulting high levels intracellular Vc induce oxidative stress massive DNA damage, causes metabolic exhaustion depleting cellular ATP reserves. HIF-positive cells particularly sensitive Vc-induced ATP reduction mostly rely rather inefficient glycolytic pathway energy production. Thus, experiments link Vc-induced toxicity cancer metabolism, providing new explanation preferential effect Vc cancer cells.
