 Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions metabolic switch. composed 3 different subunits activation depends phosphorylation threonine residue (Thr172) alpha-subunit. phosphorylation brought 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) cells converted monophosphorylated nucleotide mimicking effect AMP. show preparation cultured astrocytes used metabolic studies expresses AMPK, could phosphorylated exposure cells AICAR. effect AMPK activation glutamate metabolism astrocytes studied using primary cultures cells mouse cerebral cortex incubation media containing 2.5 mM glucose 100 microM [U-(13)C]glutamate. metabolism glutamate including detailed analysis metabolic pathways involving tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle studied using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis supplemented gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technology. found AMPK activation profound effects pathways involved glutamate metabolism since entrance glutamate carbon skeleton TCA cycle reduced. hand, glutamate uptake astrocytes well conversion glutamine catalyzed glutamine synthetase affected AMPK activation. Interestingly, synthesis release citrate, hallmarks astrocytic function, affected reduction flux glutamate derived carbon malic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase catalyzed reactions. Finally, found presence glutamate additional substrate, glucose metabolism monitored use tritiated deoxyglucose unaffected AMPK activation. Accordingly, effects AMPK activation appeared specific certain key processes involved glutamate metabolism.
