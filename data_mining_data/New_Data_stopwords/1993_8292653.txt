 fluorescent study structural functional properties conjugates number proteins (bovine serum albumin, pyruvate kinase, alpha-chymotrypsin, two toxic proteins plant origin--ricin viscumin) polyalkylene oxides (polyethylene glycol pluronic) carried out. Analysis intrinsic protein fluorescence showed structure stability various protein conjugates denaturing agents change slightly: conformational mobility tryptophan residues accessible solvent decreases, whereas tryptophan residues localized protein regions low polarity remains unchanged. Besides, conjugates display higher thermal stability comparison native proteins. fluorescence 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid water insoluble 2',3',4',5'-tetrabenzoylriboflavin bound native modified proteins indicated modification proteins polyalkylene oxides decreased polarity increased viscosity microenvironment. Hence, modification makes possible change functional characteristics protein without causing significant changes structure.
