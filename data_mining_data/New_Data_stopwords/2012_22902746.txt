 Nematodes adapted anaerobic lifestyle adult stages oxidise phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) oxaloacetate rather pyruvate final product glycolysis. adaptation involves selective expression enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), instead pyruvate kinase (PK). However, adaptation absolute aerobic nematode species. examined activity kinetics PEPCK PK larvae (L(3)) adults Teladorsagia circumcincta, parasite known exhibit oxygen uptake. Results revealed PK PEPCK activity existed L(3)s adults. enzymes differing affinity nucleotide diphosphates: utilise GDP, PK utilised ADP PEPCK utilised IDP. life cycle stages, enzymes showed similar affinity PEP. PK activity predominant stages, although activity enzyme lower adults. combined, activity levels enzyme kinetics showed pyruvate production probably favoured L(3) adult stages T. circumcincta suggest metabolism PEP oxaloacetate minor metabolic pathway species.
