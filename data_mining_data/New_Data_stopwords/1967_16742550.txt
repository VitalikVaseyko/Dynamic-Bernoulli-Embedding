 1. assay method determination phosphopyruvate carboxylase activity described improved sensitivity obtained separation enzyme interfering pyruvate kinase zone sedimentation. 2. molecular weight rat liver phosphopyruvate carboxylase determined zone sedimentation 68000. 3. Premature delivery rat foetuses uterine section results rapid appearance phosphopyruvate carboxylase, hexose diphosphatase pyruvate carboxylase, already present foetal rat liver, significantly affected, glucose 6-phosphatase activity slightly affected. 4. rate incorporation [(14)C]pyruvate glucose liver slices also greatly increased premature delivery highly significant linear correlation process phosphopyruvate carboxylase activity.
