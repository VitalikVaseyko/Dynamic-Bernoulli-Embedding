 Recent findings fields oncogenic regulation metabolism, mitochondrial function macromolecular synthesis brought tumor metabolism Warburg effect back scientific limelight. number metabolic pathways seem important tumor growth touted novel targets anticancer drug development. One candidates class drugs investigated dichloroacetate (DCA), molecule used 25 years treatment children inborn errors mitochondrial function. pyruvate mimetic compound stimulates mitochondrial function inhibiting family regulatory pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4). stimulation mitochondrial function, expense glycolysis, reverses Warburg effect thought block growth advantage highly glycolytic tumors. Interestingly, recent vitro findings shown modest "antitumor cell activity" DCA cells treated dish. However, several studies reported "antitumor activity" model tumors. apparent paradox raises question, evaluate cancer drugs designed target tumor metabolism? Traditional approaches cancer drug development used vitro assays first pass evaluate potential lead compounds. fact DCA better vivo activity vitro activity suggests unique aspects solid tumor growth metabolism difficult recapitulate vitro may important determining effectiveness class drugs.
