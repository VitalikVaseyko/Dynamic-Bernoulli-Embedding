 PURPOSE: Pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 (PKM2) key enzyme aerobic glycolysis thought contribute cancer cell metabolic reprogramming. aim study evaluate PKM2 immunohistochemical expression potential prognostic biomarker pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: tissue microarray constructed using surgical specimens 115 patients underwent resections PDAC, stained PKM2 antibody, scored expression level. Statistical analyses performed investigate association PKM2 patient survival, tumor stage, tumor grade, surgical margin status, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion status, use adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent tumors positive PKM2 expression, 47 % tumors negative PKM2 expression. PKM2 expression associated overall survival (HR 0.56, p = 0.007) CA 19-9 levels (p = 0.035), associated tumor stage, tumor grade, surgical margin status, lymph node ratio, perineural invasion, adjuvant chemotherapy use. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 expression associated overall survival PDAC. studies warranted validate value PKM2 prognostic biomarker examine potential utility PKM2 predicting treatment response, well potential therapeutic target PDAC.
