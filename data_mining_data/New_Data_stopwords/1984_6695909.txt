 Conversion pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes maturation erythroblasts five cases PK deficiency compared normal subjects using immunofluorescent antibody techniques. normal erythroblasts, M2-type PK clearly seen proerythroblast stage, markedly declined cell maturation whereas L-type PK continued increase. two patients classical type PK deficiency, M2-type PK still clearly seen orthochromatic erythroblast, whereas L-type PK hardly detected maturation. three patients types PK deficiency, change L-type PK similar normal subjects whereas M2-type PK clearly seen even later stage maturation classical-type PK deficiency. present studies indicate compensatory M2-type PK production occurs erythroblasts patients PK deficiency.
