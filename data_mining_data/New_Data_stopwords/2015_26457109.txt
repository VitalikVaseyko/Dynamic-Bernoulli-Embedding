 Breast cancer common cancer South Africa. acetone leaf extract Diospyros lycioides evaluated qualitatively quantitatively antioxidant potential using DPPH assay nitric oxide radical scavenging effect, viability MCF-7 cells evaluated using MTT. MCF-7 treated cells stained Hoechst 335258 dye annexin-V-FITC evaluated apoptotic effect extract, mRNA expression levels apoptotic genes assessed quantitative real-time PCR deferential protein expression levels using 2D gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Results revealed presence antioxidant constituents extract. Extract shown cytotoxic concentration- time-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity demonstrated due apoptosis, 70% extract-treated cells annexin-V-positive/PI negative 48 hours. extract also shown upregulate expression p53 gene concomitant downregulation Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene differentially expressed proteins identified enolase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. extract study shown induce apoptosis early stage makes ideal source explored compounds may used treatment management cancer.
