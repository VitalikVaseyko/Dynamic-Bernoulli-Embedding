 cdc 19.1 temperature-sensitive lesion genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae. phenotype mutant cell cycle specific arrest G1, expressed 37 degrees C. present study, 31P- 13C-NMR spectroscopy used analyze metabolism mutant permissive restrictive temperatures. results confirm previous findings indicated cdc 19.1 contains temperature-sensitive pyruvate kinase activity. contrast previous findings, however, present investigation demonstrates restriction pyruvate kinase activity vivo takes long 24 h fully expressed. addition, analysis NMR allowed us assess metabolic consequences pyruvate kinase restriction may contribute arrest cell growth early G1 phase cell division cycle.
