 High altitude hypoxia paraphysiological condition triggering redox status disturbances cell organization leading, via oxidative stress, proteins, lipids, DNA damage. man, skeletal muscle, prolonged exposure hypoxia, undergoes mass reduction alterations cellular level featuring reduction mitochondrial volume density, accumulation lipofuscin, product lipid peroxidation, dysregulation enzymes whose time course unknown. effects 7-9 days exposure 4559 (Margherita Hut, Monte Rosa, Italy) muscle proteins pattern investigated, pre- post-exposure, ten young subjects, 2-D DIGE MS. Ten milligram biopsies obtained mid part vastus lateralis muscle sea level (control) altitude, 7-9 days hypoxia. Differential analysis indicates proteins involved iron transport, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress responses significantly (p<0.05) decreased hypoxia. Parenthetically, hypoxia markers hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) still pre-hypoxia levels, whereas mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), marker protein synthesis, reduced.
