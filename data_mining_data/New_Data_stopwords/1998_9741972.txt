 organic hydroperoxides t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, peracetic acid found act similarly hydrogen peroxide causing inactivation enzymes within intact spores bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 concomitant mortality. Spores treated lethal levels agents germinated permeabilized enzyme assays. hierarchy sensitivities among enolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6Pdh), pyruvate kinase inactivation varied somewhat specific hydroperoxide used, possibly differences types radicals generated. However, agent inactivated enzymes, albeit different rates. Comparative assessments enzyme inactivation lethal levels H2O2 moist heat showed enzymes, G6Pdh, highly sensitive inactivation, others, ATPases, much resistant. enzymes G6Pdh aldolase highly sensitive hydroperoxide inactivation also moist heat, pyruvate kinase much sensitive hydroperoxides moist heat. overall interpretation findings hydroperoxides moist heat produce cumulative damage sensitive enzymes within spores, progressively diminishes capacities cells undergo outgrowth required return vegetative life.
