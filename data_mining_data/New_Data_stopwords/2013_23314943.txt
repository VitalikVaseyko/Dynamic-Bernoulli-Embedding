 Soybean (Glycine max) seeds store significant amounts biomass protein, levels reflect carbon nitrogen received developing embryo. relationship carbon nitrogen supply filling seed composition examined series embryo-culturing experiments. Three distinct ratios carbon nitrogen supply explored metabolic flux analysis. Labeling experiments utilizing [U-(13)C5]glutamine, [U-(13)C4]asparagine, [1,2-(13)C2]glucose performed assess embryo metabolism altered feeding conditions create corresponding flux maps. Additionally, [U-(14)C12]sucrose, [U-(14)C6]glucose, [U-(14)C5]glutamine, [U-(14)C4]asparagine used monitor differences carbon allocation. analyses revealed that: (1) protein concentration percentage total soybean embryo biomass coincided carbon-to-nitrogen ratio; (2) altered nitrogen supply dramatically impact relative amino acid storage protein subunit profiles; (3) glutamine supply contributed 10% 23% carbon biomass production, including 9% 19% carbon fatty acid biosynthesis 32% 46% carbon amino acids. Seed metabolism accommodated different levels protein biosynthesis maintaining consistent rate dry weight accumulation. Flux ATP-citrate lyase, combined malic enzyme activity, contributed significantly acetyl-coenzyme production. fluxes changed plastidic pyruvate kinase maintain supply pyruvate amino fatty acids. flux maps independently validated nitrogen balancing highlight robustness primary metabolism.
