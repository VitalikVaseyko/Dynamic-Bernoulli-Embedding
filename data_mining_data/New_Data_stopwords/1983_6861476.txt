 1. Temperature acts pyruvate kinase regulator haematopoietic cells erythrocytes. 2. Fructose-1,6-biphosphate alanine act allosteric modulators pyruvate kinase haematopoietic cells, erythrocytes although fructose-1,6-biphosphate exerts also allosteric effect, alanine appears competitive inhibitor. ATP (1.0 mM) exert clear effect pyruvate kinase cellular populations. 3. level specific activity pyruvate kinase haematopoietic cells 40-fold PK erythrocytes.
