 BACKGROUND: Jumonji C domain 2A (JMJD2A), histone demethylases, plays vital role tumorigenesis progression. But, functions underlying mechanisms JMJD2A nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) metabolism remained clarified. study, investigated glycolysis regulation JMJD2A NPC possible mechanism. METHODS: JMJD2A expression detected Western blotting Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Then, knocked ectopically expressed JMJD2A detect changes glycolytic enzymes. also evaluated impacts JMJD2A-lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) signaling NPC cell proliferation, migration invasion. ChIP assays used test whether JMJD2A bound LDHA promoter. Finally, IHC used verify JMJD2A LDHA expression NPC tissue samples analyze correlation expression clinical features. RESULTS: JMJD2A expressed high levels NPC tumor tissues cell lines. JMJD2A LDHA expression positively correlated tumor stage, metastasis clinical stage. Additionally, level JMJD2A positively correlated LDHA expression NPC patients, higher JMJD2A LDHA expression predicted worse prognosis. JMJD2A alteration influence glycolytic enzymes expression, exception PFK-L, PGAM-1, LDHB LDHA, LDHA exhibited greatest decrease expression. JMJD2A silencing decreased LDHA expression intracellular ATP level increased LDH activity, lactate production glucose utilization, JMJD2A overexpression produced opposite results. Furthermore, JMJD2A could combine LDHA promoter region regulate LDHA expression level transcription. Activated JMJD2A-LDHA signaling pathway promoted NPC cell proliferation, migration invasion. CONCLUSIONS: JMJD2A regulated aerobic glycolysis regulating LDHA expression. Therefore, novel JMJD2A-LDHA signaling pathway could contribute Warburg effects NPC progression.
