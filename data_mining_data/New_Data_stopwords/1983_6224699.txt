 enzyme activities isozyme distribution glycolytic enzymes studied K562 cell line induction hemoglobin formation. Special attention paid three regulator enzymes glycolysis, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Results K562 cell line compared mature red cell. K562 cells exhibit relatively low phosphofructokinase high pyruvate kinase activity. Electrophoresis hexokinase shows presence two bands HK region. HK II also present, probably result culture conditions. 15% total hexokinase activity mitochondrial bound. Phosphofructokinase K562 cells mainly composed L- F-types F-type characteristic platelets granulocytes erythrocytes. electrophoretic pattern pyruvate kinase predominant K4 band besides three hybrids found. hybrids demonstrated contain L-type subunits pyruvate kinase, means new erythroid marker K562 cells, red cell blood cell contains L-type pyruvate kinase. Induction experiments hemin, ARA-C mitomycin-C gave rise 85% benzidine positive cells 11 days culture. isozyme composition pyruvate kinase change induction. HK II disappears induction ARA-C mitomycin-C hemin. results support idea multipotential features K562 cell line.
