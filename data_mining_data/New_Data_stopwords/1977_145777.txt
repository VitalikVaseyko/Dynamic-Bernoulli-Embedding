 behaviour glycolytic flux glycolytic metabolic concentrations studied conditions magnesium deficiency. Mg-deficiency produced whole animals (rats) feeding diet almost completely free Mg hemolysates men addition chelating agent. results show decrease free Mg-level diminished partial destruction ATP 2,3-DPG. analysis control strength overall flux leads conclusion decrease glycolytic rate caused inhibition hexokinase-phosphofructokinase-control system. decrease MgATP-Complex free Mg++-level explains diminished phosphorylation glucose hexokinase. ATP-inhibition phosphofructokinase amplified small increase free ATP-concentration simultaneous decrease Fru-6P-level. increase PEP-level caused diminished free Mg++ MgATP-complex demonstrate larger control strength pyruvate kinase.
