 glucose given starved rats increase 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase pyruvate kinase activity decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity 30 min 60 min later. changes accompanied increase glycogen deposition modest, significant increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels time. Metabolite measurements indicated flux 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase pyruvate kinase increased. results suggest although glycogen deposition may occur via gluconeogenic pathway, glycolysis activated time changes phosphorylation state key regulatory enzymes well small rise fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.
