 P-815 mouse mastocytoma cells express K isozyme pyruvate kinase specific activity enzyme increased response N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, cholera toxin, epinephrine, also elevate intracellular concentration adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Prostaglandin F2 alpha also increases cellular activity enzyme, increase adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate levels. conditions, increase enzymatic activity accompanied equivalent increase pyruvate kinase protein level. However, neither rate enzyme synthesis level pyruvate kinase mRNA elevated N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. hand, increase enzyme's half-life. contrast, prostaglandin F2 alpha increases rate synthesis level pyruvate kinase K mRNA, influence rate degradation. Therefore, cells two mechanisms increase pyruvate kinase K levels. One operates via increase cAMP level results decrease rate degradation, whereas minimizes upsurge cAMP levels still increases pyruvate kinase K activity increasing rate synthesis.
