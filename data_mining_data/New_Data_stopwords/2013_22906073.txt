 PYK (pyruvate kinase) plays central role metabolism many organisms cell types, elucidation details function systems biology context hampered lack specific high-affinity small-molecule inhibitors. High-throughput screening used identify family saccharin derivatives inhibit LmPYK (Leishmania mexicana PYK) activity time- (and dose-) dependent manner, characteristic irreversible inhibition. crystal structure DBS {4-[(1,1-dioxo-1,2-benzothiazol-3-yl)sulfanyl]benzoic acid} complexed LmPYK shows saccharin moiety reacts active-site lysine residue (Lys335), forming covalent bond sterically hindering binding ADP/ATP. Mutation lysine residue arginine residue eliminated effect inhibitor molecule, providing confirmation proposed inhibitor mechanism. lysine residue conserved active sites four human PYK isoenzymes, also found irreversibly inhibited DBS. X-ray structures PYK isoforms show structural differences DBS-binding pocket, covalent inhibitor PYK provides chemical scaffold design new families potentially isoform-specific irreversible inhibitors.
