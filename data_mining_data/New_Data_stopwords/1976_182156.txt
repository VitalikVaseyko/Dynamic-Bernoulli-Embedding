 1. Procedures developed extraction assay glycolytic enzymes epididymis epididymal spermatozoa rat. 2. epididymis separated four segments analysis. rendered free spermatozoa efferent duct ligation, regional differences enzyme activity apparent. Phosphofructokinase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase active proximal regions epididymis, whereas hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase phosphorylase active distal segment. enzymes less active epididymis castrated animals less difference apparent proximal distal segments. However, corpus epididymidis castrated rats lower activities almost enzymes compared epididymal segments. 3. Spermatozoa required sonication obtain satisfactory enzyme release. Glycolytic enzymes active spermatozoa epididymal tissue, 10 times active case hexokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase phosphoglycerate mutase. 4. specific activities number enzymes epididymis dependent androgen status animal. included hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase phosphorylase. 5. caput cauda epididymidis differed extent enzyme activities changed response altered androgen status. notable examples hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase phosphorylase.
