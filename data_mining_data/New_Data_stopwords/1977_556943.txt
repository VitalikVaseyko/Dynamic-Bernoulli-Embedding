 denaturing either type L pyruvate kinase guanidine hydrochloride, urea, low pH, enzymatic activity quaternary structure recovered diluting enzyme buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol. denaturation type pyruvate kinase guanidine hydrochloride, yield polarization intrinsic protein fluorescence, well circular dichroism characteristic native enzyme, regained rapidly, enzymatic activity recovered much slowly. conditions used, 50% original 30-50% original type L activity typically recovered. Average half-times recovery enzymatic activity 37 min type 104 min type L depended somewhat renaturation buffer protein concentrations renaturation medium. types L pyruvate kinases renatured together, approximately random recombination two subunits types results five-membered hybrid set. used hybridizability determine kinetics reformation native tetramer denaturing isozyme beginning renaturation separately various times mixing two isozymes continuing renaturation together. studies indicate reformation stable tetramers occurs relatively slowly, qualitatively paralleling regain enzymatic activity, tetramer formation may necessary enzymatic activity. Using similar technique test spontaneous dissociation native isozymes buffer, find type L, type M, reversibly dissociates dimers monomers buffer solutions. dissociation decreased presence substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, Mg2+ ions, allosteric effector, fructose bisphosphate.
