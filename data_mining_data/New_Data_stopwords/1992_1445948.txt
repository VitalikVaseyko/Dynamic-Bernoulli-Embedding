 kinetic properties cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) germinating castor oil seeds (COS) investigated. experiments free Mg2+ concentration varied constant levels either complexed free forms substrates determined true substrates free forms phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. conclusion corroborated quenching intrinsic PKC tryptophan fluorescence free PEP ADP. Mg2+ bound free bivalent cation likely released MgATP. fluorescence data, substrate interaction kinetics, pattern inhibition products substrate analogues (adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) ADP phenyl phosphate PEP) compatible sequential, compulsory-ordered, Tri-Bi type kinetic reaction mechanism. PEP leading substrate, pyruvate last product abandon enzyme. dissociation constant limiting Km free PEP (8.2 22 38 microM, respectively) limiting Km free ADP (2.9 microM) considerably lower reported non-plant enzyme. results indicate COS PKc exists naturally activated state, similar fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated yeast enzyme. deduction consistent previous study (F.E. Podesta W.C. Plaxton (1991) Biochem. J. 279, 495-501) failed identify allosteric activators COS PKc, proposed regulatory mechanism based upon ATP levels pH-dependent alterations enzyme's response various metabolite inhibitors. plant phosphofructokinases display potent inhibition PEP, overall rate glycolytic flux hexose 6-phosphate pyruvate plant cytosol ultimately depend upon variations PEP levels brought regulation PKc.
