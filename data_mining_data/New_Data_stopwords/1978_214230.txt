 Pyruvate kinase isozymes studied normal brain tissue (both fetal adult) meningiomas malignant gliomas. fetal brain five different forms could detected electrophoresis (K4, K3M, K2M2, KM3, M4). adult brain M4-type, K3M hybrid, K4-type present; isozyme largely predominant. Alanine inhibition pyruvate kinase agreement electrophoretic pattern. Pyruvate kinase fetal brain brain newborn inhibited compared pyruvate kinase adult brain. Lineweaver-Burk plots pyruvate kinase fetal brain brain newborn nonlinear due presence hybrids. Pyruvate kinase meningiomas malignant gliomas strongly inhibited alanine. Electrophoresis proved presence mainly K4 type hybrid K3M, agreement alanine inhibition. Determination Km's phosphoenolpyruvate supports conclusion. determination alanine inhibition pyruvate kinase may diagnostic tool surgery gliomas.
