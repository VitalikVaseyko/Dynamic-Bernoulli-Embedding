 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used generate series overlapping genomic clones representing 43 bp 5' untranslated sequence, 63 bp 3' untranslated sequence entire coding sequence gene encoding potato cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc). portion gene approximately 4.5 kb length interrupted three introns, one present 5' untranslated region. Southern blot analysis indicates PKc encoded small gene family, sequence data number PCR-derived genomic clones indicate many six PKc genes. Sequence differences PCR-generated genomic clones PKc cDNA clone discussed respect fidelity Taq polymerase. alignment intron placement potato PKc gene intron placement PK genes sources indicates two potato introns correspond intron positions species.
