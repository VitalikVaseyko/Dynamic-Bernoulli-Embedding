 combined screening strategy using HTS together focused kinase library virtual screening led identification diverse chemical series PDK1 inhibitors. focused medicinal chemistry efforts 7-azaindoles low micromolar IC50s (e.g., 16: IC50=1.1muM) biochemical PDK1 assay. structure-guided optimization efforts considered also PDK1 X-ray structures weaker binding fragments resulted 7-azaindoles significantly improved biochemical PDK1 potency two-digit nanomolar range. However, potent analogues showed moderate activities cellular mechanistic assay (42: IC50=2.3muM) together either low microsomal stability low permeability. described structure-activity relationship together PDK1 X-ray structures early ADME data provided basis subsequent hit-to-lead program.
