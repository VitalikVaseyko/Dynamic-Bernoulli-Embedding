 Certain phosphocreatine preparations contain contaminant inhibits phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase assays. contaminant separated phosphocreatine anion exchange chromatography. appropriate purification, phosphocreatine effect phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase; thus, evidence serves muscle regulator enzymes. Although inhibitory preparations phosphocreatine contain inorganic phosphate trace amounts negatively charged phosphorylated contaminants, inhibitor inorganic phosphate pyrophosphate. nature inhibitor remains determined.
