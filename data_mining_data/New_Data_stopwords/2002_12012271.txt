 Summary. Many studies shown experimental type 1 diabetes causes morphological, functional, metabolic alterations small intestine. frequent form disease, type 2 diabetes, however, less studied. influence diabetes functionality small intestine studied experimental diabetes model, certain degree residual insulin secretion, specifically n0-STZ model. - diabetic rats model found glycaemia levels higher controls (8.82 +/- 0.27 6.18 +/- 0.18 mmol/L; p < 0.01), plasma insulin levels lower control rats (2.65 +/- 0.32 3.60 +/- 0.25 ng/ml; p < 0.05). Although significant variations body weight two groups, weight length intestine significantly greater (p < 0.05) diabetic rats controls. sucrase maltase activities greater (p < 0.01) proximal intestine diabetic rats (94 +/- 8 234 +/- 12 mU/mg protein, respectively) control rats (50 +/- 2 149 +/- 20 mU/mg protein, respectively). 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activity (mU/mg proteins) less (p < 0.05) proximal distal intestine diabetic rats (160 +/- 40 80 +/- 20, respectively) controls (280 +/- 30 230 +/- 30, respectively). significant differences observed lactate dehydrogenase active total pyruvate dehydrogenase measured distal proximal intestine control diabetic rats. conclusion, results show experimental diabetes (n0-STZ model) similar human type 2 diabetes produces certain morphological enzymatic alterations affect digestion absorption carbohydrates intestinal metabolism glucose. alterations may contribute producing post-prandial hyperglycaemia characterizes diabetes.
