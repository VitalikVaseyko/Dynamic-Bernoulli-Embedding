 BACKGROUND: C9, newly silico-designed inhibitor microtubule dynamics induces G2/M arrest culminating apoptosis. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, enzyme promotes pyruvate entry mitochondria. use antitumor drugs targeting different cancer features effective way overcome drug resistance. METHODS: influence C9 (130 nM) + DCA (7.5 mM) MCF-7 MCF-12 cells assessed via microscopy spectrophotometry global gene expression flow cytometry assays. RESULTS: LDH assay showed C9+DCA treatment decreased cell viability 83.5% MCF-7 cells compared non-tumorigenic MCF-12A cells 92.4% (P < 0.05). C9- C9+DCA treatment induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization MCF-7 cells MCF-12A cells (P < 0.05). occurrence apoptosis associated increased hypo- hyper-phosphorylation Bcl-2 Ser(70) caspase 7 activation. Kinase inhibition revealed sustained activation JNK pathway caused increased Bcl-2 protein Ser(70) hypo-and hyper-phosphorylation. Elevated levels DCF fluorescence observed DCA-, C9- C9+DCA-exposed MCF-7 cells, MCF-12A cells, indicating cytosolic H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) formation treated tumorigenic cells. LC3-II expression elevated C9+DCA-treated cells cell lines, indicating autophagy also induced. CONCLUSIONS: Synergistic effects C9+DCA demonstrated breast carcinoma non-tumorigenic cells selectivity towards MCF-7 cells. Antimitotic compound C9 combination glycolytic inhibitor dichloroacetate eradicates breast cancer cells ROS-JNK-Bcl-2-mediated signalling pathways vitro argued autophagy acts protective mechanism treated cells apoptosis occurs.
