 review examines mechanisms regulating activities two key enzymes determining rates glucose fatty acid oxidation, i.e., pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system. review also evaluates regulatory importance gene expression control tissue fuel selection within context substrate competition glucose fatty acids. identifies strong indirect input nutrient-gene interactions control pyruvate oxidation regulated provision pyruvate substrate PDH inhibitor PDH kinase. Nutrient-gene interactions also identified relation regulation CPT activity malonyl-CoA (inhibitor) provision long-chain acyl-CoA (substrate/activator), latter via hydrolysis plasma tissue triacylglycerol (by lipoprotein lipase hormone-sensitive lipase, respectively). discuss regulation reinforced long-term modulation PDH kinase-specific activity CPT maximal activity. also explore role mechanisms operating levels PDH complex CPT system act promote accelerate switch fuel utilization committed change nutrient supply established. particular, discuss regulatory influences exerted altered sensitivities PDH kinase inhibition pyruvate CPT inhibition malonyl-CoA, respectively.
