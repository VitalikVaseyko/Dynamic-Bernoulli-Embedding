 Effects acute inhibition glucose-6-phosphatase activity chlorogenic acid derivative S4048 hepatic carbohydrate fluxes examined isolated rat hepatocytes vivo rats. Fluxes calculated using tracer dilution techniques mass isotopomer distribution analysis plasma glucose urinary paracetamol-glucuronide infusion [U-(13)C]glucose, [2-(13)C]glycerol, [1-(2)H]galactose, paracetamol. hepatocytes, glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) content, net glycogen synthesis, lactate production glucose dihydroxyacetone increased strongly presence S4048 (10 microm). livers S4048-treated rats (0.5 mg kg(-1)min(-)); 8 h) Glc-6-P content increased strongly (+440%), massive glycogen accumulation (+1260%) observed periportal areas. Total glucose production diminished 50%. gluconeogenic flux Glc-6-P unaffected (i.e. 33.3 +/- 2.0 versus 33.2 +/- 2.9 micromol kg(-1)min(-1)in control S4048-treated rats, respectively). Newly synthesized Glc-6-P redistributed glucose production (62 +/- 1 versus 38 +/- 1%; p < 0.001) glycogen synthesis (35 +/- 5% versus 65 +/- 5%; p < 0.005) S4048. associated strong inhibition (-82%) flux glucokinase increase (+83%) flux glycogen synthase, flux glycogen phosphorylase remained unaffected. livers S4048-treated rats, mRNA levels genes encoding Glc-6-P hydrolase (approximately 9-fold), Glc-6-P translocase (approximately 4-fold), glycogen synthase (approximately 7-fold) L-type pyruvate kinase (approximately 4-fold) increased, whereas glucokinase expression almost abolished. accordance unaltered gluconeogenic flux, expression gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase unaffected S4048-treated rats. Thus, acute inhibition glucose-6-phosphatase activity S4048 elicited 1) repartitioning newly synthesized Glc-6-P glucose production glycogen synthesis without affecting gluconeogenic flux Glc-6-P 2) cellular response aimed maintaining cellular Glc-6-P homeostasis.
