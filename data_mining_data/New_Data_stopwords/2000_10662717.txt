 purpose study examine roles active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH(a)), glycogen phosphorylase (Phos), regulators lactate (Lac(-)) metabolism incremental exercise ingestion 0.3 g/kg either NaHCO(3) [metabolic alkalosis (ALK)] CaCO(3) [control (CON)]. Subjects (n = 8) studied rest, rest postingestion, constant rate cycling three stages (15 min each): 30, 60, 75% maximal O(2) uptake (VO(2 max)). Radial artery femoral venous blood samples, leg blood flow, biopsies vastus lateralis obtained power output. ALK resulted significantly (P < 0.05) higher intramuscular Lac(-) concentration ([Lac(-)]; ALK 72.8 vs. CON 65.2 mmol/kg dry wt), arterial whole blood [Lac(-)] (ALK 8.7 vs. CON 7.0 mmol/l), leg Lac(-) efflux (ALK 10.0 vs. CON 4.2 mmol/min) 75% VO(2 max). increased intramuscular [Lac(-)] resulted increased pyruvate production due stimulation glycogenolysis level Phos phosphofructokinase due allosteric regulation mediated increased free ADP (ADP(f)), free AMP (AMP(f)), free P(i) concentrations. PDH(a) increased ALK 60% VO(2 max) similar CON 75% VO(2 max). increased PDH(a) may resulted alterations acetyl-CoA, ADP(f), pyruvate, NADH, H(+) concentrations leading lower relative activity PDH kinase, whereas similar values 75% VO(2 max) may reflected maximal activation. results demonstrate imposed metabolic alkalosis skeletal muscle results acceleration glycogenolysis level Phos relative maximal PDH activation, resulting mismatch rates pyruvate production oxidation resulting increase Lac(-) production.
