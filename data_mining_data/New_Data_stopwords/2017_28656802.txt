 Tamoxifen reported associated antagonism estrogen-mediated cell growth signaling activation estrogen receptor-independent apoptosis events. demonstrated mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 direct target Caspases amplify apoptotic signaling pathway. Here, presented breast cancer MCF-7 SKBR3 cells treatment 4-hydroxytamoxifen displayed decreased level pyruvate kinase M2. Western blot results also showed 4-hydroxytamoxifen induced activity pro-apoptotic protein Caspase-3 MCF-7 SKBR3 cells, evidenced cleavage mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 substrate dose-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation immunofluorescence experiments performed clarify relationship pyruvate kinase M2 mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1. results indicated mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 associated pyruvate kinase M2 cultured mammalian cells, interaction mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 pyruvate kinase M2 decreased response 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment. addition, knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 upregulated level cleaved Caspase-3 subsequently facilitated nuclear translocation mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1. data supplemented extensive functions pyruvate kinase M2 mediating breast cancer cell viability substantially abating mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1-mediated apoptosis. summary, results identified mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 novel downstream target pyruvate kinase M2, knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 contributes apoptosis via promoting nuclear translocation mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 enhancing Caspase-3-dependent cleavage.
