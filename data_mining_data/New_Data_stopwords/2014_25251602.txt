 R132H R172K mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 2 (IDH1 IDH2) neomorphic activity generating 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) implicated oncogenesis. Although similarities structure enzyme activity two isotypic mutations suggested, difference cellular localization biochemical properties suggests differential effects metabolic oncogenesis. Using U87 cells transfected either wild-type (WT) mutant (MT) IDH genes, MT-IDH1 MT-IDH2 cells compared NMR-based metabolomics. normalized respective WT-IDH cells, general metabolic shifts MT-IDH1 IDH2 almost opposite. Subsequent analysis LC-MS metabolic pathway mapping showed key metabolites pentose phosphate pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle disproportionately altered two mutants, suggesting different activities key metabolic pathways. Notably, lactate level lower MT-IDH2 cells produced 2-HG MT-IDH1 cells, indicating Warburg effects overridden production 2-HG. also found effect mutant enzyme inhibitor mainly reduction 2-HG level rather general metabolic normalization. Overall, metabolic alterations MT-IDH1 2 different seem commensurate degree 2-HG production. R132H R172K mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 2, respectively, (IDH1 IDH2) neomorphic activity generating 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) implicated oncogenesis. mutant cell's metabolic shifts respective wild type cells almost opposite, lactate level lower IDH2 mutant only, implicating overridden Warburg effect. metabolic effect IDH1 mutant inhibitor limited 2-HG lowering.
