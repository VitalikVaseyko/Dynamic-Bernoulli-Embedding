 Mitochondria muscle parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides var. suum function anaerobically electron transport-associated phosphorylations physiological conditions. helminth organelles fractionated inner outer membrane, matrix, intermembrane space fractions. distributions enzyme systems determined compared corresponding distributions reported mammalian mitochondria. Succinate pyruvate dehydrogenases well NADH oxidase, Mg(++)-dependent ATPase, adenylate kinase, citrate synthase, cytochrome c reductases determined distributed mammalian mitochondria. contrast mammalian systems, fumarase NAD-linked "malic" enzyme isolated primarily intermembrane space fraction worm mitochondria. enzymes required anaerobic energy-generating system Ascaris would expected give rise NADH intermembrane space. need possible mechanism proton translocation system obtain energy generation suggested.
