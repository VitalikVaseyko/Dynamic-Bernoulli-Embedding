 Cancer cells express M2 isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) favoring survival hypoxic condition. Considering relative low oxygen microenvironment stem cell niche, hypothesized enhanced PKM2 expression associates biological properties cancer stem cells. used A549 human lung cancer cell line surgical resected lung cancer tissue samples patients experiments. confirmed co-localization PKM2 CD44, popular marker cancer stem cells lung cancer tissue samples patients. expression PKM2 clearly observed approximately 80% A549 human lung cancer cells. Remarkably, enhanced expression PKM2 specially observed cells also positively expressed CD44. Downregulation PKM2 CD44+ cancer stem cells siRNA significantly impaired potency spheroid formation, decreased cell survival fetal bovine serum deprivation hypoxic conditions, increased sensitivity anti-cancer drug cisplatin gamma-ray. enhanced expression PKM2 seems associate biological properties cancer stem cells A549 human lung cancer cells. Selective targeting PKM2 may provide new strategy cancer therapy, especially patients therapeutic resistance.
