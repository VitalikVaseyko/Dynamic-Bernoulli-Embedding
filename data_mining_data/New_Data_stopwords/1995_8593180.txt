 exploratory investigation made binding behavior likely encountered multivalent ligands circumstances single intrinsic binding constant suffice describe acceptor-ligand interactions. Numerical simulations theoretical binding behavior established current criteria recognizing heterogeneity cooperativity acceptor sites basis deviation binding curve rectangular hyperbolic form univalent ligands also apply interpretation corresponding binding curves multivalent ligands. However, systems source departure equivalence independence binding sites resides ligand, criteria reversed. basis observations case made attributing results experimental binding study interaction pyruvate kinase muscle myofibrils positive cooperativity enzyme sites rather heterogeneity negative cooperativity myofibrillar sites.
