 capacity malate-aspartate shuttle evaluated periportal (PP-H) perivenous subfraction rat hepatocytes (PV-H). rate glutamine production alanine 34-fold higher PV-H PP-H. Statistically significant differences PP-H PV-H found activities lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities NAD(+)-malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial alanine aminotransferase. rate glucose production sorbitol rate ethanol utilization higher PP-H PV-H. presence phenazine methosulfate (PMS), increments rates significantly greater PV-H PP-H. capacity malate-aspartate shuttle presence alanine significantly higher PP-H PV-H presence asparagine similar PP-H PV-H. results suggest capacity malate-aspartate shuttle distributes heterogeneously along liver lobules dominance periportal zone difference capacity may result difference transport aspartate across mitochondrial membrane.
