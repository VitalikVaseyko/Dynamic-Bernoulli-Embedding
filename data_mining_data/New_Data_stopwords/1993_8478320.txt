 discovery novel multicistronic operon encodes phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis reported. three genes operon, designated pfk, pyk, ldh, contain 340, 502, 325 codons, respectively. intergenic distances 87 bp pfk pyk 117 bp pyk ldh. Plasmids containing pfk pyk conferred phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity, respectively, host. identity ldh established previously approach (R. M. Llanos, A. J. Hillier, B. E. Davidson, J. Bacteriol. 174:6956-6964, 1992). genes preceded potential ribosome binding site. operon expressed 4.1-kb transcript. 5' end transcript determined G nucleotide positioned 81 bp upstream pfk start codon. pattern codon usage within operon highly biased, 11 unused amino acid codons. degree bias suggests operon highly expressed. three proteins encoded operon key enzymes Embden-Meyerhoff pathway, central pathway energy production lactic acid synthesis L. lactis. reason, called operon las (lactic acid synthesis) operon.
