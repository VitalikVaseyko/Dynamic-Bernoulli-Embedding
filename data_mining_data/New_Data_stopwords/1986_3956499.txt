 mechanisms responsible stimulation phenylephrine gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone glycerol studied perifused rat hepatocytes. stimulation phenylephrine glucose formation dihydroxyacetone biphasic. Transient stimulation 25% 3 min followed stable stimulation 15% 7 min later. Concomitantly transient inhibition phenylephrine pyruvate kinase flux first minutes followed stable inhibition 10 min. stable inhibition could quantitatively account stable stimulation gluconeogenesis hormone dihydroxyacetone gluconeogenic substrate. effects phenylephrine independent cAMP. reduced gluconeogenic substrate, glycerol, transient aminooxyacetate-sensitive stimulation gluconeogenesis occurs, followed stable stimulation smaller magnitude [Leverve, X. M., Groen, A. K., Verhoeven, A. J. Tager, J. M. (1985) FEBS Lett. 181, 43-46]. transient phase stimulation abolished addition low concentrations pyruvate, accordance previous proposal phenylephrine transiently accelerates mitochondrial oxidation cytosolic NADH via malate/aspartate shuttle. transient stimulation gluconeogenesis glycerol accompanied transient increase cytosolic/mitochondrial aspartate concentration gradient. Phenylephrine caused transient stimulation mitochondrial aspartate efflux two systems dependent operation malate/aspartate shuttle, i.e. gluconeogenesis lactate oxidation ethanol. proposed addition phenylephrine hepatocytes brings transient increase mitochondrial membrane potential hence increased rate transport aspartate mitochondria cytosol.
