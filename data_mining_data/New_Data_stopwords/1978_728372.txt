 Two new mutant Pks, electrophoretically identical kinetically slightly different, reported. two clinically innocuous PK variants, encountered two non-related subjects, combined daughter give fully expressed haemolytic anaemia. functional abnormalities daughter's PK (increased K0.5 PEP, abnormal response FDP, increased urea guanidine-HCl stability, abnormal isoelectrofocusing electrophoretic patterns) like parents pronounced, except thermostability normal proband although markedly decreased parents. family examined demonstrates relationship vitro properties variant severity haemolysis. hypothesis put forward cause haemolysis PK deficiency may associated another defect located red cell membrane.
