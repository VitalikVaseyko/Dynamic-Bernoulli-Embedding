 Differentiated cells primarily metabolize glucose energy via tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells thrive different mechanism produce energy, characterized Warburg effect, describes increased dependence aerobic glycolysis. M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), responsible catalyzing final step aerobic glycolysis, highly expressed cancer cells may contribute Warburg effect. However, whether PKM2 plays contributing role early cancer development unclear. studies, made attempt elucidate effects varying mitochondrial respiration substrates skin cell transformation expression PKM2. Tumorigenicity murine skin epidermal JB6 P+ (promotable) cells measured soft agar assay using 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) tumor promoter. observed significant reduction cell transformation upon pretreatment mitochondrial respiration substrate succinate malate/pyruvate. observed increased expression activity PKM2 TPA-treated JB6 P+ cells pretreatment succinate malate/pyruvate suppressed effects. addition, TPA treatment also induced PKM2 whereas PKM1 expression suppressed mouse skin epidermal tissues vivo. comparison JB6 P+ cells, nonpromotable JB6 P- cells showed increase PKM2 expression activity upon TPA treatment. Knockdown PKM2 using siRNA approach significantly reduced skin cell transformation. Thus, results suggest PKM2 activation could early event play contributing role skin tumorigenesis.
