 BACKGROUND: increasing concern environmental impact petroleum based economy, focus shifted towards greener production strategies including metabolic engineering microbes conversion plant-based feedstocks second generation biofuels industrial chemicals. Saccharomyces cerevisiae attractive host purpose extensively engineered production various fuels chemicals. Many target molecules derived central metabolite molecular building block, acetyl-CoA. date, difficult engineer S. cerevisiae continuously convert sugars present biomass-based feedstocks acetyl-CoA derived products due intrinsic physiological constraints-in respiring cells, precursor pyruvate directed away endogenous cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis pathway towards mitochondria, fermenting cells pyruvate directed towards byproduct ethanol. study incorporated alternative mode acetyl-CoA biosynthesis mediated ATP citrate lyase (ACL) may obviate constraints. RESULTS: characterized activity several heterologously expressed ACLs crude cell lysates, found ACL Aspergillus nidulans demonstrated highest activity. employed push/pull strategy shunt citrate towards ACL deletion mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) engineering higher flux upper mevalonate pathway. demonstrated combining two modifications increases accumulation mevalonate pathway intermediates, modifications required substantially increase production. Finally, incorporated block strategy replacing native ERG12 (mevalonate kinase) promoter copper-repressible CTR3 promoter maximize accumulation commercially important molecule mevalonate. CONCLUSION: combining push/pull/block strategies, significantly improved mevalonate production. anticipate strategy used improve efficiency industrial strains S. cerevisiae convert feedstocks acetyl-CoA derived fuels chemicals.
