 past years, rapid advances made field red cell enzymopathies associated hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, particularly molecular basis. Nucleotide sequence amino acid sequence normal human red cell enzymes clarified phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase adenosine deaminase. Furthermore, aldolase-, triosephosphate isomerase-, diphosphoglycerate mutase-, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-, adenylate kinase deficiency, single nucleotide changes cause single amino acid substitutions finally hemolysis, found.
