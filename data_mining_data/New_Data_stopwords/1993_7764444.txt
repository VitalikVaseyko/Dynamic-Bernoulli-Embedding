 flow-injection system assay trace levels ATP described incorporates small column reactor containing co-immobilized hexokinase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. presence appropriate cofactors, ATP synergistic operation enzymes repeatedly recycled, resulting substrate amplification. ultimately generated NADH measured fluorometrically. approach, enzymatic degradation step detection step completely separated, possible operate individually optimal conditions. amplification factor directly proportional residence time sample zone within enzyme reactor, time might manipulated altering flow-rate extreme performing stopped-flow experiments. Amplification factors 15 1000 obtained, found increased amplifications lead significantly lower detection limits; thus, appears practical lower limit detection order 1-5 nM. investigation paradoxical feature, possible explanation it, given.
