 Influential research Warburg Cori 1920s ignited interest cancer cells' energy generation different normal cells. observed high glucose consumption large amounts lactate excretion cancer cells compared normal cells, oxidised glucose using mitochondria. therefore assumed cancer cells generating energy using glycolysis rather mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria dysfunctional. Advances research techniques since shown mitochondria cancer cells functional across range tumour types. However, different tumour populations different bioenergetic alterations order meet high energy requirement; Warburg effect consistent across cancer types. review discuss metabolic reprogramming cancer, possible explanations high glucose consumption cancer cells observed Warburg, suggest key experimental practices consider studying metabolism cancer.
