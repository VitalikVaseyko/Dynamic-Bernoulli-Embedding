 Cancer cells characterized reprogramming energy metabolism. last decade, understanding metabolic changes occur cancer increased dramatically, great interest targeting metabolism cancer therapy. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (abbreviations: PKM2, M2-PK) plays key role modulating glucose metabolism support cell proliferation. PKM2, like PK isoforms, catalyzes last energy-generating step glycolysis, unique capacity regulated. PKM2 regulated several cellular levels, including gene expression, alternative splicing post-translational modification. addition, PKM2 regulated key metabolic intermediates interacts twenty different proteins. Hence, isoenzyme important regulator glycolysis, additionally functions novel roles recently emerged. Recent evidence indicates intervening complex regulatory network PKM2 severe consequences tumor cell proliferation, indicating potential enzyme target tumor therapy.
