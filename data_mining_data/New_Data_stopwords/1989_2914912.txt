 Genomic clones containing rat pyruvate kinase gene, encodes M1- M2-type isozymes, isolated exon sequences determined. gene contains 12 exons 11 introns 20 kilobases (kb) long. sequences specific M1- M2-types exist exons 9 10, respectively (Noguchi, T., Inoue, H., Tanaka, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13807-13812). seventh intron begins GC dinucleotide instead consensus GT dinucleotide, exon-intron boundaries consistent "GT-AG" rule. S1 mapping analysis showed M1- M2-type mRNAs multiple, transcription initiation sites. Thus, M1- M2-type isozyme mRNAs concluded produced gene transcript alternative RNA splicing. RNA blot hybridization analysis indicated developmental changes isozymes brain skeletal muscle regulated level RNA splicing. 5'-flanking region gene "TATA box" "CAAT box," contains potential Sp1 binding sites. Bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay revealed fragment 0.5 kb 5'-flanking region gene sufficient promotor activity rat hepatoma cell line, dRLh-84. activity present adult rat hepatocytes, indicating 0.5-kb fragment tissue-specific promoter activity. processed-type pseudogene resembles M2-type pyruvate kinase cDNA also characterized.
