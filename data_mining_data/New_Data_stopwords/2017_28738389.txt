 BACKGROUND/AIMS: enhanced proliferation pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) central pathological component pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Warburg effect platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) involved proliferation PASMCs. However, mechanism underlying crosstalk Warburg effect PDGF PASMC proliferation still unknown. hypothesized PDGF promotes Warburg effect via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) proliferative PASMCs. METHODS: PASMCs derived pulmonary arteries SD rats; cell viability, presence metabolites, metabolic enzyme activities assay determined MTT assays, kit assays western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: PDGF promoted PASMC proliferation dose- time-dependent manner, accompanied enhanced Warburg effect. Treatment PDGFR antagonists, Warburg effect inhibitor PDK1 inhibitor significantly inhibited PI3K signaling activation, HIF-1alpha expression PASMC proliferation induced PDGF, respectively. Furthermore, treatment PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors remarkably suppressed PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation Warburg effect. CONCLUSION: microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski Warburg effect plays critical role PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation mediated activation PI3K signaling pathway HIF-1alpha.
