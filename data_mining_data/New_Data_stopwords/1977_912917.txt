 1. isolated erythrocytes ratio reduced oxidized glutathione modified addition diazinedicarboxylic acid bis-dimethylamide (diamide). Incubation erythrocytes, decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, resulted increase [S]0.5 pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate measured haemolysates. presume increase due oxidation enzyme. 2. apparent affinity pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate returned normal GSSG formed reduced GSH intracellularly. Oxidation pyruvate kinase could also reversed incubation haemolysates reducing agents 2-mercaptoethanol dithioerythritol. 3. Intracellular oxidation pyruvate kinase caused significant changes Hill coefficient (n) Vmax enzyme. However, heat stability oxidized enzyme lower normal. Lability increased increasing oxidation enzyme. 4. possible role oxidation processes pyruvate kinase deficiency discussed. concluded 'in vitro' also intact erythrocyte, pyruvate kinase sensitive oxidizing agents intracellular redox state. However, decreased GSH/GSSG ratio single cause acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency seems highly improbable.
