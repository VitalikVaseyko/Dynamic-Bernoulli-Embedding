 conversion precancerous lesions full-fledged cancers requires affected cells surpass certain rate-limiting steps. recently showed activation HRAS proto-oncogene urothelial cells transgenic mice causes simple urothelial hyperplasia (SUH) persistent whose transition low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (UC) must undergo nodular urothelial hyperplasia (NUH). hypothesized NUH, acquired fibrovascular cores, plays critical roles mesenchymal-to-epithelial signaling, breaching barriers urothelial tumor initiation. Using proteomics involving two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting pan-phosphotyrosine antibody MALDI-mass spectrometry, identified isoform 2 pyruvate kinase (PKM2) major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein switched NUH. extended finding using specimens transgenic mice, human UC UC cell lines, establishing PKM2, spliced variant PKM1, over-expressed low-grade and, prominently, high-grade UC. muscle-invasive UC, PKM2 co-localized cytokeratins 5 14, UC progenitor markers. Specific inhibition PKM2 siRNA shRNA suppressed UC cell proliferation via increased apoptosis, autophagy unfolded protein response. results strongly suggest PKM2 plays important role genesis low-grade non-invasive high-grade invasive urothelial carcinomas.
