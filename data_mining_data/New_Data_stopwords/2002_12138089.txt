 trypanosomatids, including Trypanosoma brucei, glycolysis takes place peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. closed compartments wherein energy redox (NAD(+)/NADH) balances need maintained. characterized T. brucei gene called FRDg encoding protein 35% identical Saccharomyces cerevisiae fumarate reductases. Microsequencing FRDg purified glycosome preparations, immunofluorescence, Western blot analyses clearly identified enzyme glycosomal protein expressed procyclic form T. brucei present trypanosomatids studied, i.e. Trypanosoma congolense, Crithidia fasciculata Leishmania amazonensis. specific inactivation FRDg gene expression RNA interference showed FRDg responsible NADH-dependent fumarate reductase activity detected glycosomal fractions least 60% succinate secreted T. brucei procyclic form (in presence d-glucose sole carbon source) produced glycosome FRDg. conclude FRDg plays key role energy metabolism participating maintenance glycosomal NAD(+)/NADH balance. also detected significant pyruvate kinase activity cytosol T. brucei procyclic cells observed previously. Consequently, propose revised model glucose metabolism procyclic trypanosomes may also valid trypanosomatids except T. brucei bloodstream form. Interestingly, H. Gest hypothesized previously (Gest, H. (1980) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 7, 73-77) soluble NADH-dependent fumarate reductase present primitive organisms evolved present day fumarate reductases, quinol-dependent. FRDg may characteristics ancestral enzyme NADH-dependent fumarate reductase characterized date.
