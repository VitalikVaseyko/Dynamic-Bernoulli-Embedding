 novel supramolecular oligomer, cyclic polylactate (CPL), first discovered culture medium HeLa-S tumour cells, reported inhibit growth FM3A ascites tumour cells inhibiting activities pyruvate kinase (PK) lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). synthesized CPL-containing oligomers polymerization numbers ranging 9 19, prolonged heating rapid mixing carbohydrate compound L-lactic acid monomer (C(3)H(6)O(3)) decreased pressure studied effects growth leukemic cells. Treatment 0.02 mg/ml CPL inhibited growth HL60 TF-1 cells, growth K562 cells inhibited 0.2 mg/ml CPL. concentration 2 mg/ml CPL required inhibit granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (CFU-GM) burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) precursor colony formation among normal bone marrow cells. Furthermore, 7A6 antigen expression DNA ladder formation observed leukemic cells cultured CPL, indicating CPL induces apoptotic changes cells. findings suggest CPL might useful chemotherapeutic agent leukemia.
