 Malignant transformation often accompanied significant metabolic changes. identify drivers underlying changes, calculated metabolic flux states NCI60 cell line collection correlated variance metabolic states lines properties. analysis revealed remarkably consistent structure underlying high flux metabolism. three primary uptake pathways, glucose, glutamine serine, characterized three features: (1) metabolite uptake sufficient stoichiometric requirement sustain observed growth, (2) overflow metabolism, scales excess nutrient uptake basal growth requirement, (3) redox production, also scales nutrient uptake greatly exceeds requirement growth. discovered resistance chemotherapeutic drugs lines broadly correlates amount glucose uptake. results support interpretation Warburg effect glutamine addiction features growth state provides resistance metabolic stress excess redox energy production. Furthermore, overflow metabolism observed may indicate mitochondrial catabolic capacity key constraint setting upper limit rate cofactor production possible. results provide greater context within metabolic alterations cancer understood.
