 LuxI/R quorum-sensing system associated N-acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) signal widespread among Gram-negative bacteria. Although inhibition indole AHL quorum signalling Pseudomonas aeruginosa Acinetobacter oleivorans reported previously, documented among species. Here, show co-culture wild-type Escherichia coli, E. coli tnaA mutants lack tryptophanase result produce indole, inhibits AHL-regulated pigmentation Chromobacterium violaceum (violacein), Pseudomonas chlororaphis (phenazine) Serratia marcescens (prodigiosin). Loss pigmentation also occurred pure culture growth Chro. violaceum, P. chlororaphis S. marcescens presence physiologically relevant indole concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM). Inhibition violacein production indole counteracted addition Chro. violaceum cognate autoinducer, N-decanoyl homoserine lactone (C10-HSL), dose-dependent manner. addition exogenous indole co-culture E. coli also affected Chro. violaceum transcription vioA (violacein pigment production) chiA (chitinase production), effect pykF (pyruvate kinase), quorum regulated. Chro. violaceum AHL-regulated elastase chitinase activity inhibited indole, motility. Growth Chro. violaceum affected indole C10-HSL supplementation. Using nematode-feeding virulence assay, observed survival Caenorhabditis elegans exposed Chro. violaceum, P. chlororaphis S. marcescens enhanced indole supplementation. Overall, studies suggest indole represents general inhibitor AHL-based quorum signalling Gram-negative bacteria.
