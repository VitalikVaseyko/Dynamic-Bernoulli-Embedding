 Pyruvate kinase (PK) key control point glycolysis-the biochemical pathway central energy metabolism production precursors used biosynthesis. PK type 1 Escherichia coli (Ec-PK1) activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). date, possible determine whether enzyme tetrameric low concentrations (i.e. low nM range) used study steady-state kinetics, assess whether allosteric effectors alter oligomeric state enzyme concentrations. Employing new technique analytical ultracentrifugation fluorescence detection have, first time, shown K(D)(4-2) Ec-PK1 subnanomolar range, well concentrations used kinetic studies. addition, show that, unlike PK isoenzymes, modulation oligomeric state allosteric effectors FBP PEP occur concentration 10 nM above.
