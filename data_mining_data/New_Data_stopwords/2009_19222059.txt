 BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue liver play important roles mediating metabolic actions glucocorticoids. However, effects glucocorticoids glucose lipid metabolism skeletal muscle understood completely. Intracellular glucocorticoid action dependent 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD1), enzyme converts cortisone active cortisol. METHODS: investigated direct role HSD1 cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells using siRNA pharmacological inhibitors enzyme. Primary human skeletal muscle cells cultured presence 0.5 microM cortisone 0.5 microM cortisol eight days. siRNA utilized reduce expression either HSD1 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4. Effects pharmacological inhibitors HSD1 also studied. RESULTS: Exposure cortisone cortisol decreased basal glucose uptake glucose incorporation glycogen, without effect insulin-stimulated response. Glucocorticoid exposure increased palmitate oxidation, well expression PDK4. siRNA-mediated reduction pharmacological inhibition HSD1 prevented effects cortisone, cortisol, metabolic responses. siRNA-mediated reduction PDK4 prevented effect cortisol attenuate glycogen synthesis. CONCLUSION: Targeted reduction pharmacological inhibition HSD1 primary human skeletal muscle cells prevents effects cortisone, cortisol, glucose metabolism palmitate oxidation. Furthermore, glucocorticoid-mediated reductions glucose metabolism dependent PDK4.
