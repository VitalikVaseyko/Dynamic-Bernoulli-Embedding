 Cardiac metabolism following hypothermic potassium cardioplegia blood cardioplegia vehicle studied two groups patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. 15 patients, blood given single dose infusion (single dose group) 18 patients initial bolus followed continuous perfusion (25-30 ml/min) modified blood heart-lung machine (continuous blood group). Simultaneous samples drawn arterial coronary sinus blood first 60 min cardioplegia. continuous blood group, samples also drawn period cardioplegic perfusion. samples analyzed PO 2, O2-saturation content, PCO2, pH, lactate, pyruvate, glucose, potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), isoenzyme MB, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). addition myoglobin enzymes followed peripheral venous blood 24 hours. Myocardial biopsies taken left ventricle beginning end cardioplegia analyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine (C) creatinephosphate (CP). pattern metabolic changes cardioplegia similar groups decreased myocardial oxygen extraction, marked lactate potassium release, increased glucose uptake significant enzyme myoglobin release. However, degree changes significantly smaller continuous blood group. myocardial biopsies also showed significantly less ATP CP decrease continuous blood group, suggesting, together metabolic results, myocardial protection afforded continuous blood cardioplegia superior single dose group. Furthermore, continuous perfusion permitted easy control myocardial temperature period aortic cross-clamping.
