 OBJECTIVE: Antidepressants known positively influence several factors patients depressive disorders, resulting increased neurogenesis subsequent relief depressive disorders. study effects venlafaxine neural differentiation cellular level, looked effect protein expression regulation mechanisms neural differentiation. METHODS: exposing NCCIT cell-derived EBs venlafaxine differentiation (1 day 7 days), changes protein expression analyzed 2-DE MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Gene levels proteins regulated venlafaxine analyzed real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment venlafaxine decreased expression prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4HB), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2K (HIP2) plastin 3 (T-plastin), up-regulated expression growth factor beta-3 (TGF-beta3), dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 (DPYSL3), pyruvate kinase (PKM) differentiation 1 7 days. cells exposed venlafaxine, mRNA expression patterns HIP2 PKM, function negative positive regulators differentiation neuronal survival, respectively, consistent observed changes protein expression. CONCLUSION: findings may contribute improve understanding molecular mechanism venlafaxine.
