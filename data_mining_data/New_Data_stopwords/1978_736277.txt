 effects number prostaglandins metabolism fructose epididymal ejaculated ram spermatozoa investigated using conventional Warburg techniques. Spermatozoa two sources collected concurrently electrical stimulation; epididymal spermatozoa harvested via cannula inserted chronically one vas deferens thus free exposure seminal prostaglandins. general, metabolism fructose spermatozoa little affected wide range prostaglandins concentration 20 micrograms/ml. PGs present semen, PGE2, PGE3 PGF2alpha significant effects whereas PGE1 PGF1alpha significantly increased lactate accumulation latter increased oxygen uptake, cases without significantly changing fructose utilization, fructose oxidized CO2 production. 15-methyl-substituted PGE2 PGF2alpha corresponding methyl esters failed change fructose metabolism unlikely therefore lack response PGE2 PGF2alpha due metabolized spermatozoa incubation. number breakdown products tested, PGA1 lesser extent PGA2 appeared inhibit Krebs tricarbocyclic acid cycle 15-keto 13,14-dihydro-PGF2alpha appeared stimulate it. general, epididymal spermatozoa responded PGs way ejaculated spermatozoa. Thus confirm suggestion literature spermatozoa lowered sensitivity PGs vitro contact PGs seminal plasma.
