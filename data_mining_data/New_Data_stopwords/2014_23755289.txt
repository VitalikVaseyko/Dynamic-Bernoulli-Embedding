 previously shown deoxynojirimycin-polysaccharide mixture (DPM) decreased blood glucose also reversed damage pancreatic beta-cells diabetic mice, anti-hyperglycemic efficacy combination better 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) polysachharide alone. However, mechanisms behind effects fully understood. present study aimed evaluate therapeutic effects DPM streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic symptoms potential mechanisms. Diabetic mice treated DPM (150 mg/kg body weight) 90 days continued fed without DPM additional 30 days. Strikingly, decrease blood glucose levels observed DPM treated diabetic mice, persisted 30 days cessation DPM administration. Significant decrease glycosylated hemoglobin hepatic pyruvate concentrations, along marked increase serum insulin hepatic glycogen levels detected DPM treated diabetic mice. Results labeled (13)C6-glucose uptake assay indicated DPM restrain glucose absorption. Additionally, DPM down-regulated mRNA protein expression jejunal Na(+)/glucose cotransporter, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase glucose transporter 2, enhanced activities well mRNA protein levels hepatic glycolysis enzymes (glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, private kinase pyruvate decarboxylas E1). Activity expression hepatic gluconeogenesis enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase) also found attenuated diabetic mice treated DPM. Purified enzyme activity assays verified increased activities glucose glycolysis enzymes resulted direct activation, relative increase protein expression. Importantly, histopathological observations support results biochemical analyses validate protective effects DPM STZ-induced damage pancreas. Thus, DPM significant potential therapeutic agent diabetes.
