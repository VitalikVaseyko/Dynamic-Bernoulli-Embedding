 vector constructed expression Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) cytoplasm Trichoplusia ni cells. construct pDDR101 comprises mature-E1alpha coding sequence control Polh promoter, plus mature-E1beta coding sequence control p10 promoter. E1alpha sequence engineered include N-terminal His-tag. protein samples subjected immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, alpha- beta-subunits co-eluted, indicating association. recombinant protein sample analyzed gel permeation chromatography, demonstrated significant amount eluted size consistent assembly alpha2beta2 heterotetramer. Recombinant E1 able decarboxylate [1-14C]pyruvate substrate vitro phosphorylation E1-kinase.
