 BACKGROUND: Recently, high validity correlation tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (Tu M2-PK) isoenzyme comparison standard tumor markers demonstrated solid tumors. investigated marker 67 patients advanced breast cancer (ABC) comparison healthy controls. MATERIALS METHODS: Plasma Tu M2-PK measured using ELISA assay (ScheBo Tech, Giessen, Germany) serum CA27.29 determined using chemiluminescent immunoassay (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, USA). RESULTS: ROC analysis, cut-off discriminate patients controls established 15 U/ml Tu M2-PK (specificity 85%; positive predictive value 81%) 30 U/ml CA27.29 (specificity 91%; positive predictive value 92%). Median ABC baseline levels (ranges) patients ABC Tu M2-PK CA27.29 12.8 U/ml (4.8-252,495) 130 U/ml (13.3-8130), respectively. Response assessment done 45 chemotherapy courses 38 pts. 13 19 blocks (68.4%) PD (progressive disease), elevated level Tu M2-PK baseline follow-up found. 17 20 blocks (85%) SD (stable disease), Tu M2-PK level normal baseline normalised within 4 weeks treatment. 6 patients disease remission normal baseline Tu M2-PK level levels decreased promptly. CONCLUSION: Tu M2-PK gives additional information ABC, indicating disease activity sensitivity chemotherapy CA27.29 reflects tumor burden.
