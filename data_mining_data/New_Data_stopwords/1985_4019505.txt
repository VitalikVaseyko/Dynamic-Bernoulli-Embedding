 activation pyruvate dehydrogenasea kinase activity CoA esters characterized. Half-maximal activation kinase activity achieved 1.0 microM acetyl-CoA 20-s preincubation presence NADH. 80% acetyl-CoA consumed period acetylating sites pyruvate dehydrogenase complex result transacetylation reaction proceeding equilibrium. 1.0 microM acetyl-CoA, resulted 4-fold higher level CoA residual acetyl-CoA. Activation kinase activity could result either acetylation specific sites complex tight binding acetyl-CoA. Removal CoA enhanced acetylation activation, suggesting acetylation mediates activation. allosteric binding acetyl-CoA elicit activation, activation constant, Ka, less 50 nM would required. distinguish mechanisms, effects CoA esters well reactivity effective CoA esters characterized. Several short-chain CoA esters enhanced kinase activity including (in decreasing order effectiveness) malonyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA. Butyryl-CoA inhibited kinase activity high concentrations long-chain acyl-CoAs. Inhibition long-chain acyl-CoAs may result, part, detergent-like properties esters. Malonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, obtained radiolabeled acyl groups, shown acylate sites complex. Propionyl-CoA butyryl-CoA tested, competition acetyl-CoA pyruvate, alternative substrates acylation sites complex competitive effectors kinase activity. Propionyl-CoA alone rapidly acylated sites complex low concentrations, low concentrations propionyl-CoA effective activating kinase activity although relatively small activation observed. equivalent level (20 microM) acetyl-CoA propionyl-CoA used, marked activation kinase activity due dominant effect acetyl-CoA associated acetylation major portion sites complex small portion undergoing acylation propionyl-CoA. results rapidly achieved manner independent order addition two CoA esters. indicates tight slowly reversible binding acetyl-CoA involved kinase activation. High levels propionyl-CoA greatly reduced acetylation acetyl-CoA nearly prevented activation kinase activity acetyl-CoA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
