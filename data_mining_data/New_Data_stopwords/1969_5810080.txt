 1. Pyruvate kinase Alaskan king-crab leg muscle exists two kinetically distinct forms, displays different temperature-dependence K(m) phosphoenolpyruvate. 2. ;cold' variant enzyme hyperbolic kinetics exhibits minimal K(m) substrate 5 degrees . physiological concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate ;cold' enzyme active 10 degrees . ;warm' pyruvate kinase minimal K(m) substrate 12 degrees . enzyme displays sigmoidal kinetics likely inactive, physiological substrate concentrations, temperatures 9 degrees . 3. combined activities two pyruvate kinases yield highly temperature-independent rates catalysis, physiological substrate concentrations, range habitat temperatures encountered organism, namely 4-12 degrees . 4. two variants pyruvate kinase appear isoenzymes conventional sense. Electrophoretic electrofocus analyses revealed single peaks activity. 5. results suggest ;warm' pyruvate kinase ;cold' pyruvate kinase formed temperature-dependent interconversion one protein species. interconversion major adaptive significance: temperature lowered ;warm' enzyme converted ;cold' enzyme; opposite situation obtains temperature raised. Temperature changes thus mimic effects noted fructose 1,6-diphosphate certain mammalian pyruvate kinases.
