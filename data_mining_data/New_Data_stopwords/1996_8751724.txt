 study role glucokinase (GK) control glucose metabolism liver, transgenic mice generated GK overexpressed control P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter. Whereas expression GK gene starved control mice blocked, promoter able direct expression enzyme liver starved transgenic mice. Furthermore, starved transgenic mice showed levels GK activity fourfold higher starved control similar fed control. activation GK led increase intracellular concentration glucose 6-phosphate, also related induction glycogen accumulation. addition, L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) activity increased transgenic mice, starved showed similar levels activity control fed mice. induction L-PK caused increase hepatic lactate concentration. Furthermore, hepatocytes primary culture transgenic mice incubated 20 mM glucose produced levels lactate threefold higher controls, difference noted hepatocytes control transgenic mice incubated 2 mM glucose. results demonstrated vivo activation GK rate-limiting step induction glycolysis glycogen synthesis. changes liver glucose metabolism led marked reduction blood glucose (30%) insulin (40%) concentrations. Furthermore, transgenic mice showed lower levels blood glucose intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, indicating GK overexpression caused increase blood glucose disposal liver. findings show key role liver GK control whole-body glucose homeostasis.-Ferre, T., Riu, E., Bosch, F., Valera, A.
