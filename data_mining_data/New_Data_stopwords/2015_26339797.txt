 Gastric cancer grows hypoxic environment. HIF-1alpha known play important role controlling production reactive oxygen species (ROS) mitochondria hypoxic conditions. previously established HIF-1alpha knockdown (KD) cells control (SC) cells 58As9 gastric cancer cell line. study, revealed KD cells, SC cells, induced apoptosis conditions hypoxia (1% O2) due excessive production ROS. quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated expressions ten genes, involved control mechanisms ROS (including Warburg effect, mitophagy, electron transport chain [ETC] modification ROS scavenging), regulated HIF-1alpha. Moreover, promotion glucose uptake glucose plus insulin (GI) treatment enhanced apoptotic effect, accompanied ROS production hypoxic KD cells. Western blot analysis showed membranous expression GLUT1 KD cells elevated glucose and/or insulin treatments, indicating GI-induced glucose uptake mediated increased translocation GLUT1 cell membrane. Finally, anti-tumor effect HIF-1alpha knockdown (KD) plus GI evaluated using tumor xenograft model, hypoxic environment naturally exists. result, GI treatment strongly inhibited growth KD tumors whereby cell apoptosis highly induced comparison control treatment. contrast, growth SC tumors expressing HIF-1alpha affected GI treatment. Taken together, results suggest HIF-1alpha inhibition plus GI may ideal therapy, apoptosis due destruction ROS homeostasis specifically induced gastric cancer grows hypoxic environment, normal tissue aerobic conditions.
