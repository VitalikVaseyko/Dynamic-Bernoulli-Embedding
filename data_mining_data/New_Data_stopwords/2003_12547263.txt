 objective understand influence dietary gluconeogenic amino acids hepatic glucose metabolism rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). analyzed effects partial substitution dietary protein single gluconeogenic dispensable amino acid (DAA: alanine, aspartic acid glutamic acid), regulation hepatic glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes. fed juvenile rainbow trout isonitrogenous isoenergetic diets part nitrogen fishmeal replaced nitrogen one three DAA. Fish fed 9 weeks samples withdrawn 6 h feeding 5 days food deprivation. data show clear effect excess DAA activities glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase pyruvate kinase) compared control diet. contrast, feeding caused significant repression gluconeogenic enzyme activities (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) fish fed three DAA substituted diets. However, differences insufficient affect postprandial glycemia significantly. conclusion, excess dietary DAA tested seem modify glycemia negative impact dietary carbohydrate utilization rainbow trout.
