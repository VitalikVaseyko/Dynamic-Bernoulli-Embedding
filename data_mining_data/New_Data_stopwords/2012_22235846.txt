 Ectopic deposition lipids liver extrahepatic tissues alters function occurs adipose tissue fat storage capacity exceeded. investigated sexual dimorphism effects dietary obesity liver insulin signaling pathway, well connection differences hepatic fat accumulation. Ten-week-old Wistar rats sexes fed standard diet high-fat diet 26 weeks. Insulin, adipokine levels, glucose tolerance measured. Lipid content, PPARalpha mRNA expression protein levels insulin receptor subunit beta (IRbeta), IR substrate 2 (IRS-2), Ser/Thr kinase (Akt), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) measured liver. control rats, serum parameters hepatic levels IRbeta, IRS-2, Akt proteins pointed profile better insulin sensitivity females. response dietary treatment, female rats exhibited greater increase body mass adiposity lower liver fat accumulation males, maintained better glucose tolerance. reduced insulin signaling capacity liver obese female rats seems prevent lipid accumulation probably lipotoxicity-associated hepatic disorders.
