 method described measure directly rat brain activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHa kinase; EC 2.7.1.99), catalyzes inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC, EC 1.2.4.1, EC 2.3.1.12, EC 1.6.4.3). activity showed expected dependence added ATP divalent cation, expected inhibition dichloroacetate, pyruvate, thiamin pyrophosphate. results, properties pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.43), indicate mechanisms control phosphorylation PDHC seem qualitatively similar brain tissues. Regionally, PDHa kinase active cerebral cortex hippocampus, less active hypothalamus, pons medulla, olfactory bulbs. Indeed, PDHa kinase activity olfactory bulbs uniquely low, sensitive inhibition pyruvate dichloroacetate cerebral cortex. Thus, significant quantitative differences enzymatic apparatus controlling PDHC activity different parts brain.
