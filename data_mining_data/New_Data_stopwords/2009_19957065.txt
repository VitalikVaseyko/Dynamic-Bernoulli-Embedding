 order determine activity O-linked GlcNAc transferase (OGT), modified coupled enzyme method proposed. method based measurement uridine 5'-(trihydrogen diphosphate) (UDP), product generated transglycosylation reaction. assay, UDP coupled conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate using pyruvate kinase. Using commercial pyruvate assay kit, pyruvate converted red terminal product, could photometrically measured 570 nm fluorometrically measured 587 nm (E(m) = 535 nm) microplate reader. Kinetic study truncated recombinant mOGT quantitative analysis OGT two biological samples indicated method practical competitive quantitative analysis OGT.
