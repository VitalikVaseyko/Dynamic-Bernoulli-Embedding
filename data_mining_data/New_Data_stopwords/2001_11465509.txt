 Kainic acid (KA), potent neurotoxin excitatory amino acid, leads derangements modulation brain proteins. global brain protein expression pattern induced KA-treatment reported yet. therefore studied effect systemic KA administration levels brain proteins. Rats injected placebo KA intraperitoneally brain taken one week. mitochondrial cytosolic fractions brain proteins analyzed proteomics technologies levels selected proteins quantified using specific software. Heat shock protein HSP 27 exclusively detected brains animals treated KA, whereas glucose regulated protein GRP 78 downregulated. levels neurofilaments alpha-internexin significantly decreased fragment tubulin alpha-1 chain manifold increased KA-brains. mitochondrial enzymes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, ATP synthase beta chain isocitrate dehydrogenase reduced pyruvate kinase M1 increased following KA treatment. conclude concomitant determination brain proteins indicates altered regulation heat shock proteins, neuronal death, cytoskeletal disruption, mitochondrial derangement systemic KA administration. report confirms extends previous studies effect KA expression brain proteins suggests analytical system serve model neurotoxicological, neurobiological, neuropathological proteome studies.
