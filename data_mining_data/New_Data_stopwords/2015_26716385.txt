 Cancer cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis support growth, metabolic alteration commonly referred 'Warburg effect.' Here, show tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) crucial Warburg effect human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). contrast normal brain, GBMs show increased TRAP1 expression. used GBM cell lines neurospheres derived human GBM specimens examine effects Knockdown TRAP1 GBM cell lines glioma stem cells. also used neurosphere recovery assay measured neurosphere formation three time points assess capacity culture repopulate knockdown TRAP1. results showed knockdown TRAP1 strongly decreased GBM cell proliferation migration, inhibited neurosphere recovery, secondary neurosphere formation, enhanced therapeutic effect temozolomide neurosphere cultures. GBM, knockdown TRAP1 appeared inhibit tumor growth migration regulatory effects metabolic reprogramming.
