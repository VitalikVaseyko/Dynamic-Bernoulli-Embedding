 genome Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas extremaustralis analyzed searching genes involved environmental adaptability focusing anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulation, cold adaptation, exopolysaccharide production degradation complex compounds. Experimental evidences demonstrated functionality several pathways, including arginine pyruvate fermentation, alginate production growth cold conditions. Phylogenetic analysis along genomic island prediction allowed detection genes probable foreign origin coding acetate kinase, osmotic resistance colanic acid biosynthesis. findings suggest P. extremaustralis horizontal transfer events and/or gene redundancy could play key role survival unfavorable conditions. Comparative genome analysis traits representative Pseudomonas species highlighted several similarities differences extremophile bacterium.
