 previously demonstrated low number interleukin-4 receptors (IL-4Rc) HL-60 leukemia cells render population susceptible differentiation IL-4. occurs normal human monocytes, IL-4 induces expression HLA-DR surface antigens HL-60 cells well. second messenger pathway(s) involved IL-4 stimulation leading class II up-regulation fully examined. show IL-4-induced class II antigen expression HL-60 cell line normal human monocytes calcium/calmodulin-independent since theophylline (TPH, calmodulin inhibitor) block IL-4 effect. addition, pyruvate kinase C (PKC) pathway seem participate process either system activation PKC 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) insufficient induce HLA-DR. found, however, second messenger pathway mediated G protein system since IL-4 concomitantly induces class II p21ras expression successfully blocked highly specific anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody. addition, using another p21ras inducer, 5-azacytidine C (5-AzaC), showed agent also induce expression p21ras class II, inhibited antibody. Thus, appears IL-4 selects G protein system signaling pathway order exert action induction HLA-DR human normal monocytes M2 leukemia target cells. Since monocytes macrophages participate virtually immune reactions, regulation class II induction obvious importance.
