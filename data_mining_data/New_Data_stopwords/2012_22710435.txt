 Proliferating cells consume glucose cope bioenergetics biosynthetic demands rapidly dividing cells well counter shift cellular redox environment. study investigates hypothesis manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) regulates cellular redox flux glucose consumption cell cycle. direct correlation observed glucose consumption percentage S-phase cells MnSOD wild-type fibroblasts, absent MnSOD homozygous knockout fibroblasts. Results electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy flow cytometric assays showed significant increase cellular superoxide levels S-phase cells, associated increase glucose oxygen consumption, decrease MnSOD activity. Mass spectrometry results showed complex pattern MnSOD-methylation lysine (68, 89, 122, 202) arginine (197 216) residues. MnSOD protein carrying K89A mutation significantly lower activity compared wild-type MnSOD. Computational-based simulations indicate lysine arginine methylation MnSOD quiescence would allow greater accessibility enzyme active site well increase positive electrostatic potential around within active site. Methylation-dependent changes MnSOD conformation subsequent changes electrostatic potential around active site quiescence versus proliferation could increase accessibility superoxide, negatively charged substrate. results support hypothesis MnSOD regulates "metabolic switch" progression quiescent proliferative cycle. propose MnSOD new molecular player contributing Warburg effect.
