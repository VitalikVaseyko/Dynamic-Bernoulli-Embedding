 result using variety assay techniques, rather different values rate pyruvate kinase (PK) reaction obtained. Kinetic measurements performed red cell PK using stopped-flow well "classical" spectrophotometric method demonstrated initiation reaction ADP yields reproducible results standard assay. Moreover, influence substrate concentrations, activator concentrations, ionic strength, buffer system, temperature duration preincubation thoroughly investigated shown play important role. consequence kinetic measurements, modified optimised assay composition together new normal values erythrocyte PK activity haemolysate presented. better characterisation comparability PK variants, suggest use optimised assay composition described reaction initiated ADP.
