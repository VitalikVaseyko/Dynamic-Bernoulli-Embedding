 SDS-PAGE used separate tissue proteins control trematode-infected Biomphalaria alexandrina snails. separated profiles demonstrate occasional appearance protein fractions remarkable increase concentration certain molecular masses infected snails one week interval four weeks post exposure Schistosoma mansoni. Proteins molecular masses 44, 56, 65 144 KDa among occasionally appeared protein masses. Post exposure S. mansoni larval infection, protein mass 36 KDa predominant giving markedely higher absorbance (> 1) compared control (0.0166). identified lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Moreover, protein 56 KDa mass identified Pyruvate kinase. predicted induction two enzymes could either host and/or parasitic origin. study revealed S. mansoni- B. alexandrina complex completely different protein pattern compared control low similarity coefficient "S" value. correlation snail tissue protein separation patterns metabolic redirection snail host developing sporocyst discussed.
