 BACKGROUND: Warburg effect describes increased glucose uptake cancer cells, glucose transporter proteins overexpressed many tumors. study, evaluated expression 14 SLC2A genes encoding glucose transporter proteins papillary thyroid carcinoma patients. METHODS: Clinical information gene expression data 499 papillary thyroid carcinoma patients downloaded Cancer Genome Atlas database. Correlations SLC2 gene family (SLC2A1-14) mRNA expression levels clinicopathologic factors analyzed. RESULTS: 14 mortalities follow-up (median, 21.6 months). Patient overall mortality associated age >/=45 years, extrathyroidal extension, higher TNM stage, increased expression SLC2A1, SLC2A3, SLC2A14 mRNA. Greater SLC2A1, SLC2A3, SLC2A14 expression associated increased mortality (odds ratio: 11.692, 95% confidence interval: 3.362-36.938; odds ratio: 12.725, 95% confidence interval: 4.247-40.187; odds ratio: 13.768, 95% confidence interval: 4.208-61.710, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated overall survival shorter patients high rather low SCL2 expression (SLC2A1, P = .003; SLC2A3, P < .001; SLC2A14, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Upregulation SLC2A1, SLC2A3, SLC2A14 genes associated increased mortality papillary thyroid carcinoma patients, SLC2 gene expression levels potentially useful prognostic indicators.
