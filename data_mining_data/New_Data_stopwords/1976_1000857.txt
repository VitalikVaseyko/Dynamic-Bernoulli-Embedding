 mutant erythrocyte isozyme pyruvate kinase (PK) (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) found associatin chronic hemolytic anemia two siblings doubly heterozygous isozyme quantitative PK deficiency usual form. isozyme characterized approximately normal maximum reaction velocities markedly decreased affinity substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 5-fold 10-fold increases half-saturation constants decreased interaction substrate binding sites. Two distinctly separable kinetic patterns PEP observed multiple specimens. Concentrations fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) required half-maximal activation two orders magnitude greater controls, optimal pH lowered 6.5. stability 4 degrees C markedly decreased, lost enzyme could reactivated fdp periods even longer normal controls.
