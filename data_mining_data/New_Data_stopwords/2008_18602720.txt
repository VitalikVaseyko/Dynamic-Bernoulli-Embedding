 Since various neuromuscular diseases associated abnormal glycosylation, interest determine whether key post-translational modification also altered aged skeletal muscle. Lectins represent highly versatile carbohydrate-binding proteins routinely employed characterization glycoproteins. Here, used lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) proteomic profiling senescent fibers. WGA labeling soluble proteome 3-month- versus 30-month-old rat gastrocnemius muscle, following two-dimensional gel electrophoretic separation, resulted identification 13 distinct protein species. Analysis WGA binding levels, conjunction mass spectrometric fingerprinting, revealed one isoform major metabolic muscle protein exhibited drastic alteration content sialic acid N-acetylglucosaminyl sugar residues. Pyruvate kinase isoform M1 protein accession number gi|16757994|, exhibiting pI 6.6 apparent molecular mass 57.8 kDa, showed six fold increase N-glycosylation three fold decrease protein expression. contrast comparable levels N-glycosylated proteins young adult versus senescent muscle, judged fluorescein-conjugated WGA labeling transverse muscle cryosections, staining antibodies M1 isoform pyruvate kinase showed reduced expression cytosolic element. Furthermore, activity assays demonstrated reduced activity glycolytic enzyme senescent muscle. agrees idea abnormal post-translational modifications key metabolic enzymes may involved conversion aged muscle slower twitch patterns drastic shift aerobic-oxidative metabolism.
