 OBJECTIVE: explore molecular mechanism erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). METHODS: Targeted sequence capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) used detect regions exon exon-intron boundarie PKLR gene clinical suspected PKD patient. protein function mutant gene forecasted SIFT PolyPhen-2 databank, mutation PKLR gene patient detected NGS technology, genotype confirmed Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: patient found peculiar double heterozygous mutations: 661 G>A (Asp221Asn) exon 5 1528 C>T (Arg510Ter) exon 10, resulting amino acid substitution Asp221Asn Arg510Ter, mutations also confirmed Sanger sequencing. complex mutations infrequent able cause diseases. CONCLUSION: complex mutations 661 G>A 1528 C>T PKLR gene molecular mechanism PKD. Simultaneous existance above-mentioned complex mutations PDK patient never previously reported home abroad.
