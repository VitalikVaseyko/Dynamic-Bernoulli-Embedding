 effect shift long short photoperiod CO2 exchange Chenopodium polyspermum studied. Equal quantities photosynthetic energy given daily plants, long photoperiods produced low intensity red light extension. change photoperiod shown affect pattern CO2 loss beginning night period onset CO2 intake beginning day time. events seem phytochrome control.The photoperiod effect slope CO2 curve photosynthesis, efficiency photosynthesis increased short day. effect due variation stomatal resistance.The action O2 concentration photosynthesis (Warburg effect) affected photoperiodic treatment, less important long day short day.Involvement phytochrome photosynthetic efficiency photorespiration discussed.
