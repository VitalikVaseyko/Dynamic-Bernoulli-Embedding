 Tau protein kinases (TPK) II isolated candidate enzymes responsible hyperphosphorylation observed PHF-tau. Four phosphorylation sites tau identified kinase, accounting most, all, major phosphorylation sites PHF-tau. Immunostaining anti-TPKI antibody indicated kinase up-regulated AD brain. up-regulation TPKI phosphorylatioin tau reproduced treating cultured hippocampal cells amyloid beta (Abeta) protein. addition, found TPKI phosphorylate inactivate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), expected result depletion acetyl-CoA, key substrate acetyl choline synthesis. Indeed, septum cells treated Abeta, level acetyl choline decreased dramatically.
