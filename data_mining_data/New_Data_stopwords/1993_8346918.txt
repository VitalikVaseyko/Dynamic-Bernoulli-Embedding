 Iron ions micromolar concentrations induced rapid selective inhibition activity skeletal muscle creatine kinase (CK), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, pyruvate kinase (PK). effect iron dependent presence adenine nucleotides redox state iron. Changing redox state media created different Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios selectively depressed different enzymes: depression PK activity occurred iron predominantly reduced form and, consequently, high Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio; depression SR Ca2+ uptake SR Ca(2+)-ATPase activity occurred Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio close 1; depression CK activity occurred iron predominantly oxidized form Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio low. iron-sensitive enzymes possessed sulfhydryl groups, accessible N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), essential activity. rate inhibition enzyme activity NEM increased order PK < Ca(2+)-ATPase < CK. Iron-induced depression CK PK activities reversible dithiotreithol. Results suggest changes redox state cellular microenvironments, inevitably occur reperfusion ischemic tissue rapid increase tissue oxygen consumption, may selectively depress activity several enzymes bearing SH groups sensitive modifications essential activity. Iron-induced depression enzyme activity depends availability iron bound adenine nucleotides possibly low molecular weight chelators Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio generated induced redox change.
