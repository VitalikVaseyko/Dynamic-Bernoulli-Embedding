 study, found that, Bacillus subtilis, citrate-glucose cometabolism leads zero acid production wide range growth rates nearly theoretical carbon yield. Experimental results presented point pyruvate kinase (PYK) site citrate-mediated glycolytic flux attenuation. First, measured fluxes show that, compared cultures grown glucose, PYK flux drops tenfold citrate added. Second, relative cultures metabolizing glucose, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool elevates substantially, whereas pyruvate pool drops, citrate present. Finally, modeling results indicate maximizing carbon yield corresponds nearly eliminating pyruvate kinase (PYK) flux pyruvate supplied PEP-consuming glucose transport system supply biosynthetic requirements. literature review suggests mechanisms PYK attenuation citrate addition occur. juncture, hypothesize direct PYK inhibition occurs which, turn, also leads phosphofructokinase inhibition via elevated PEP pool. two inhibition events combine throttle glycolytic flux; minimize acid formation; substantially increase cellular, product, energetic yields.
