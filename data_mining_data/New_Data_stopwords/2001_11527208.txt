 Recent advances genetic technology provided new platform simultaneous analysis large number genes possible rapid efficient fashion. assess differential expression human genes neuronal differentiation, compared transcript profiles undifferentiated, partially differentiated, fully differentiated NT2/D1 cultures cDNA expression arrays. Approximately 75 genes (13% gene array pool) differentially expressed neuronal development NT2/D1 cells. Genes coding pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme, clathrin assembly proteins, calmodulin, fibronectin, laminin, thymosin beta-10, many others upregulated NT2/D1 cells differentiated neurons. contrast, several kinases, phosphatases, G-protein coupled receptor genes showed downregulation upon neuronal differentiation. information provided invaluable reference characterizing phenotype cells. information also used cell therapy transplantation graft microenvironment interaction host tissue crucial.
