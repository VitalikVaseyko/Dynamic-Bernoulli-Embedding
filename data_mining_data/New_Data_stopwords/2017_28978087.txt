 switch pyruvate kinase (PK) M1 PKM2 pivotal glucose metabolism cancers. PKM1/M2 shift controlled alternative splicing two mutually exclusive exons PKM gene. PKM1 expressed differentiated tissues, whereas PKM2 expressed cancer tissues. study revealed haplodeficiency FUSE-binding protein (FBP)-interacting repressor (FIR), transcriptional repressor c-myc gene, contributed splicing PKM1 PKM2 mice thymic lymphoma and/or T-cell type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) using six-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis. TMT revealed 648 proteins up- downregulated mice thymic lymphoma tissues compared wild type mouse. proteins included transcription factors proteins involved DNA damage repair, DNA replication, T-cell activation/proliferation, apoptosis, etc. Among them, PKM2 protein, PKM1, upregulated thymic lymphoma well T-ALL. Using qRT-PCR, revealed activation PKM2 mRNA higher thymic lymphoma cells FIR(+/-)TP53(-/-) mice control lymphocytes FIR(+/+)TP53(-/-) sorted flow cytometry. FIR knockdown siRNA suppressed hnRNPA1 expression HeLa cells. results indicated FIR haplodeficiency contributes alternative splicing PKM1 PKM2 partly inhibiting hnRNPA1 expression thymic lymphoma cells prior T-ALL. Taken together, findings suggest FIR related spliceosomes potential therapeutic targets cancers, including T-ALL.
