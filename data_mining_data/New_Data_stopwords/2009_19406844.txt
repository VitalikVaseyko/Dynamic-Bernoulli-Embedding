 Glucose-mediated activation L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene repressed cAMP, making excellent model studying mechanism contrary signals regulate gene expression. Using 832/13 rat insulinoma cell line, demonstrate using RNA interference chromatin immunoprecipitation carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), coactivator CREB binding protein (CBP) required glucose response L-PK gene recruited promoter glucose. cAMP agonist forskolin blocked glucose-mediated induction L-PK gene PKA-dependent manner blocked recruitment ChREBP, HNF4alpha, CBP L-PK promoter, simultaneously recruiting CBP cAMP-inducible gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (NR4A2). Overexpression CBP, ChREBP, reversed cAMP repression L-PK gene. addition, CBP augmented glucose response L-PK promoter. conclude cAMP glucose signaling converge complex containing ChREBP, HNF4alpha, CBP, cAMP acts disrupting transcriptional complex assembled glucose-derived signals.
