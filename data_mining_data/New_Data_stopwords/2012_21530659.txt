 Impairment mitochondrial function might contribute oxidative stress associated neurodegeneration amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Glutamate levels tissues ALS patients sometimes altered. neurons, mitochondrial metabolism exogenous glutamine mainly responsible net synthesis glutamate, neurotransmitter, also necessary synthesis glutathione, main endogenous antioxidant. investigated glutathione synthesis glutamine/glutamate metabolism motor neuronal model familial ALS. standard culture conditions (with glutamine) restricting glutamine cystine, level glutathione always lower cell line expressing mutant (G93A) human Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (G93ASOD1) line expressing wild-type SOD1. glutamine difference glutathione associated lower glutamate impairment glutamine/glutamate metabolism evidenced lower glutaminase cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity. d-beta-hydroxybutyrate, alternative glutamine energy substrate addition glucose, reversed decreases cytosolic malate dehydrogenase activity glutamate glutathione. However, G93ASOD1 cell line, culture conditions expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase l protein, down-regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, induced, together increase lactate release medium. findings suggest glutathione decrease associated mutant SOD1 expression due mitochondrial dysfunction caused reduction flow glucose-derived pyruvate TCA cycle; implies altered glutamate metabolism depends different mitochondrial energy substrates.
