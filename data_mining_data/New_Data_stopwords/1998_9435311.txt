 normoxic conditions, myocardial glucose utilization inhibited alternative oxidizable substrates available. work show inhibition relieved presence cAMP, studied mechanism effect. Working rat hearts perfused 5.5 mM glucose alone (controls) together 5 mM lactate, 5 mM beta-hydroxybutyrate, 1 mM palmitate. effects 0.1 mM chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), cAMP analogue, studied group. Glucose uptake, flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inhibited hearts perfused alternative substrates, addition CPT-cAMP completely relieved inhibition. mechanism CPT-cAMP induced preferential utilization glucose related increased glucose uptake glycolysis, activation phosphorylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, enzyme responsible synthesis fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, well-known stimulator 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase. vitro phosphorylation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased Vmax enzyme decreased sensitivity inhibitor citrate. Therefore, hearts perfused various oxidizable substrates, cAMP induces preferential utilization glucose concerted stimulation glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogen breakdown, glucose oxidation.
