 BACKGROUND: Cyclin D1 important protein cell cycle progression; however, functions independent cell cycle described liver. Cyclin D1 also involved DNA repair, overexpressed many cancers, functions proto-oncogene. lesser-known roles Cyclin D1, specifically hepatocytes, impact liver steatosis hormone regulation liver. METHODS: comprehensive search PubMed conducted using keywords Cyclin D1, steatosis, lipogenesis, liver transplantation. article, review results literature search, focus role Cyclin D1 hepatic lipogenesis gluconeogenesis, well impact function protein hepatic steatosis. RESULTS: Cyclin D1 represses carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) results decrease transcription fatty acid synthase (FAS) acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase (ACC). Cyclin D1 also inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) involved hepatic lipogenesis. Cyclin D1 inhibits hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1alpha) represses transcription lipogenic genes FAS liver-type pyruvate kinase (Pklr), along gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 represses multiple proteins involved lipogenesis gluconeogenesis liver. Targeting Cyclin D1 decrease hepatic steatosis patients nonalcoholic fatty liver disease alcoholic fatty liver disease may help improve patient health quality donor liver pool.
