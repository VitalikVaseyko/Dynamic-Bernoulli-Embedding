 aim current study investigate effect permanent heat exposure 21 days pig performance, nutrient digestibility, physiological response key enzyme skeletal muscle energy metabolism. Twenty-four male finishing pigs (crossbreed castrates, 79.0 +/- 1.50 kg body weight) allocated three groups (n = 8): (1) Control (ambient temperature (AT) 22 degrees C, ad libitum feeding), (2) Group (AT 30 degrees C, ad libitum feeding) (3) Group PF (AT 22 degrees C, pair-fed Group HE). permanent heat exposure decreased feed intake (p < 0.01), daily body weight gain (p < 0.05) digestibility gross energy, dry matter, crude protein ash (p < 0.05); rectal temperature respiration rate significantly increased (p < 0.01). levels plasma cortisol, creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase also significantly increased Group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, heat exposure changed intracellular energy metabolism, AMP-activated protein kinase activated (p = 0.02). combined changes parameters glycolysis accumulation lactic acid (p = 0.02) drop pH24 h (p = 0.02), increase hexokinase pyruvate kinase activity (p < 0.01) and, finally, maturation process post mortem muscle influenced. Due pair-feeding possible evaluate effects heat exposure, dependent reduced feed intake. effects were, e.g., reduced nutrient digestibility changed activities several enzymes muscle blood serum.
