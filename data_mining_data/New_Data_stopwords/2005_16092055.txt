 skeletal muscle humans, transcription several metabolic genes transiently induced recovery exercise food consumed. determine potential influence substrate availability transcriptional regulation metabolic genes recovery exercise, 9 male subjects (aged 22-27) completed 75 minutes cycling exercise 75% Vo2 max 2 occasions, consuming either high-carbohydrate (HC) low-carbohydrate (LC) diet subsequent 24 hours recovery. Nuclei isolated tissue frozen vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained exercise 2, 5, 8, 24 hours exercise. Muscle glycogen restored near resting levels within 5 hours HC trial, remained depressed 24 hours LC trial. 2- 8-hour recovery period, leg glucose uptake 5- 15-fold higher HC ingestion, whereas arterial plasma free fatty acid levels approximately 3- 7-fold higher LC ingestion. Exercise increased (P < .05) transcription and/or mRNA content pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, uncoupling protein 3, lipoprotein lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, hexokinase II, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. Providing HC recovery reversed activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, uncoupling protein 3, lipoprotein lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase within 5 8 hours exercise, whereas providing LC recovery elicited sustained/enhanced increase activation genes 8 24 hours recovery. findings provide evidence factors associated substrate availability and/or cellular metabolic recovery (eg, muscle glycogen restoration) influence transcriptional regulation metabolic genes skeletal muscle humans recovery exercise.
