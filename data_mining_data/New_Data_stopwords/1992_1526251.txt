 effects sodium orthovanadate (0.6 mg/ml drinking water) hexokinase isozymes, pyruvate kinase malic enzyme liver kidney control alloxan diabetic rats studied compared. Vanadate treatment diabetic rats normalized hyperglycemia almost completely restored differentially altered enzyme profile liver (a tissue underutilizes glucose diabetes) kidney (a tissue overutilizes glucose diabetes). Vanadate therapy, however, could restore depressed plasma insulin level diabetic rats. study clearly indicates vanadate effectively normalize many metabolic abnormalities even low insulin level insulin-dependent -independent tissues diabetic rats.
