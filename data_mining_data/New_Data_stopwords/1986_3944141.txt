 hormonal regulation molecular forms Type L pyruvate kinase investigated rat hepatocytes maintained primary culture. Five isoelectric forms enzyme subunit identified isoelectric focusing 8 urea. Immediately pulse labeling rat hepatocytes [35S]methionine radioactivity observed one major (D-band) one minor (I-band) peptide band. isoelectric forms shown dephosphorylated forms subunit. Acute administration 0.1 microM glucagon accompanied disappearance D- I-bands appearance two additional forms (P- A-bands, respectively). latter two forms demonstrated phosphorylated forms subunit. fifth isoelectric form pyruvate kinase subunit (B-band) identified immunolocation; however, incorporation radioisotope band low. Chronic administration glucagon dexamethasone significant influence molecular properties pyruvate kinase. However, novel observations concerning influence glucose ethanol phosphorylation state enzyme made. hepatocytes maintained 5.5 mM glucose 24-48 h, activity ratio pyruvate kinase decreased 0.65 0.40 enzyme became partially phosphorylated. Raising glucose concentration 28 mM prevented rapidly reversed phosphorylation state enzyme. Administration low concentrations ethanol (1-20 mM) caused decline activity ratio pyruvate kinase presence 5.5 28 mM glucose. latter observations concerning influence glucose ethanol first demonstrating nutrients metabolites alter phosphorylation state enzyme absence hormonal stimuli.
