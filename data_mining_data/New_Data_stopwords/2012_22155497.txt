 histone-acetylations histone deacetylases shown play key role cardiac remodeling. Recently, become abundantly clear many non-histone proteins modified post-translational lysine acetylations acetylations regulate protein activity, conformation, binding. present study, non-histone acetylated proteins associated heart failure identified. Global screening lysine acetylated proteins performed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled immunoblotting primary monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Lysine acetylated proteins compared two rodent models hypertensive heart failure, Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) spontaneously hypertensive heart failure prone (SHHF) rats corresponding controls, i.e., Dahl salt-resistant (SR) W (W) rat strains, respectively. Forty-one 66 acetylated proteins detected SS SHHF failing hearts, respectively, either detected detected less abundance corresponding control hearts. Twelve acetylated proteins common models heart failure. identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry followed Mascot Analysis included mitochondrial enzymes: ATP synthase, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase. abundance NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (Sirt3), mitochondrial deacetylase reduced SS SHHF failing hearts. first description non-histone protein acetylations associated heart failure raises prospect acetylations mitochondrial proteins linked reduced Sirt3 mediate, part, metabolic changes heart failure.
