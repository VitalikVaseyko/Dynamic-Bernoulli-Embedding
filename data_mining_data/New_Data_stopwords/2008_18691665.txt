 present work aimed contribute understanding adaptation glycolytic pathway tissues frog Rana ridibunda land snail species Helix lucorum seasonal hibernation. Moreover responses glycolytic enzymes cold acclimated R. ridibunda H. lucorum studied well. drop Po(2) blood hibernated frogs land snails indicated lower oxygen consumption decrease metabolic rate. activities glycolytic enzymes indicated hibernation differential effect glycolyis two species studied also tissues species. activity l-LDH decreased significantly skeletal muscle heart hibernated R. ridibunda indicating low glycolytic potential. Similar biochemical responses observed tissues cold acclimation. continuous increase activities glycolytic enzymes studied, except HK, might indicate compensation impacts low temperature enzymatic activities. contrast R. ridibunda, activities enzymes increased remained higher levels prehibernation controls indicating maintenance glycolytic potential tissues hibernating land snails.
