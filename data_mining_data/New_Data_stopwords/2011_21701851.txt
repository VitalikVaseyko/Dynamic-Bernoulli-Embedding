 currently renewed focus aimed understanding allosteric mechanisms atomic resolution. current interest seeks understand changes protein conformations changes protein dynamics contribute relaying allosteric signal two ligand binding sites protein (e.g., active allosteric sites). nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), monitoring protein dynamics directly, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, monitoring solvent accessibility backbone amides, offer insights protein dynamics. Unfortunately, many allosteric proteins exceed size limitations standard NMR techniques. Although hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) offers alternative evaluation method, application hydrogen/deuterium exchange requires property measured functions H(2)O D(2)O. Due promising future H/DX-MS evaluation allosteric mechanisms large proteins, demonstrate evaluation allosteric regulation D(2)O. Exemplified using phenylalanine inhibition rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, find binding inhibitor greatly reduced D(2)O, effector continues elicit allosteric response.
