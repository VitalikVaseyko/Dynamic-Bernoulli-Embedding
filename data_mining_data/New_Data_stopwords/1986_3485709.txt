 Supplementation diets vitamin E shown enhance immune responses numerous animal models. However, experiments investigated dietary requirement vitamin E optimal T- B-lymphocyte mitogen responses compared directly requirement growth, maintenance spleen-body weight ratios, platelet count well prevention myopathy red blood cell lysis. found male weanling rats maintain normal rate growth spleen-body weight ratio fed purified diets containing 7.5 mg/kg vitamin E. level 15 mg/kg adequate prevent myopathy, 50 mg/kg necessary prevention red blood cell hemolysis. dietary requirement optimum T- B-lymphocyte responses mitogens greater 50 mg/kg significantly correlated plasma vitamin E levels range 0.04-18 micrograms/ml. Thus, requirement index immune system activity higher functional parameters vitamin E adequacy measured. Therefore, immune system responds changes dietary vitamin E well signs frank vitamin deficiency.
