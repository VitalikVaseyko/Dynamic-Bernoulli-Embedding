 aim study evaluate effects yerba mate (YM) extract phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway vivo. mice introduced either standard- high-fat diet (HFD). 8 weeks HFD, mice randomly assigned one two treatment conditions, water yerba mate extract 1.0 g/kg. treatment, glucose blood level hepatic insulin response evaluated. Liver tissue examined determine mRNA levels using PI3K-AKT PCR array. nuclear translocation forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) determined electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. data demonstrated yerba mate extract significantly decreased final body weight, glucose blood levels, insulin resistance mice. Molecular analysis demonstrated HFD downregulated Akt2, Irs1, Irs2, Pi3kca, Pi3kcg, Pdk1; yerba mate treatment, levels genes returned baseline. addition, HFD upregulated Pepck G6pc increased FOXO1 nuclear translocation. intervention downregulated genes decreasing FOXO1 nuclear translocation. results obtained demonstrate first time specific action yerba mate PI3K-AKT pathway, contributed observed improvement hepatic insulin signaling.
