 rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene possesses two promoters located 500 bp apart. L' promoter specific erythroid cells. L promoter specific liver regulated diet hormones; positively glucose insulin negatively glucagon via cAMP. DNA elements involved tissue-specific hormone-regulated gene expression located within 3.2 kbp 5' flanking region previously demonstrated transgenic mice analysis [Tremp, G. L., Boquet, D., Ripoche, M. A., Cognet, M., Yu-Chun, L., Jami, J., Kahn, A. Daegelen, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19,904-19,910]. Moreover, observed mice gene expression dependent transgene copy number independent integration site. present DNase-I-hypersensitivity analysis endogenous rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene two transgene constructs relation development, tissue differentiation, nutritional hormonal status. rats, two groups proximal sites detected endogenous gene; hypersensitive site (HSS) HSS-1 adult liver HSS-A fetal liver (a major erythropoietic tissue). groups probably related transcriptional initiation complexes either L L' promoter. Two distal groups detected; HSS-2 -3 kbp (with respect liver-specific cap site) adult liver HSS-B around -4 kbp fetal liver. sites thought correspond activating sequences; adult liver, deletion fragment encompassing HSS-2 provokes dramatic reduction transcription starting L promoter transgene. adult liver, HSS-1 appears transcription-associated site, greatly weakened fasted rats, HSS-2 transcription independent. pattern DNase-I hypersensitivity similar rat endogenous gene complete rat transgene; liver-specific HSS-1 HSS-2 present intensity sites correlated number integrated copies. Interestingly, HSS-1 still detectable intensity remains proportional number integrated copies truncated transgene HSS-2 deletion, transgene weakly (but nevertheless tissue-specifically) expressed. results strongly suggest transgene copy possesses complete set specific nucleoprotein complexes that, without HSS-2, DNA potentially active configuration.
