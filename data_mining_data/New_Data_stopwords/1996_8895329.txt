 Recent data suggest involvement Janus tyrosine kinase-2 (JAK2) human GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation GH receptor insulin receptor substrates 1 2 (IRS-1 IRS-2), leading activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase acute insulin-like effects primary rat adipocytes. investigate functional role kinase, screened number tyrosine kinase inhibitors ability inhibit three rapid effects GH primary adipocytes: increased lipogenesis, inhibition noradrenaline-induced lipolysis, promotion JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. staurosporine found inhibit three effects. inhibition lipogenesis antilipolysis exhibited staurosporine dose dependency (IC50, approximately 40 nM) inhibition JAK2 IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation well binding p85 subunit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase IRS-1 IRS-2. unidentified cytosolic tyrosine-phosphorylated protein pp95, contrast, affected, suggesting phosphorylated primarily JAK2. Protein kinase C seem directly involved insulin-like effects, selective protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C effect levels 100 nM unspecific cellular effects occurred. Methyl-2,5-dihydroxy cinnamate inhibited GH-induced lipogenesis [3-3H]glucose nonstimulated lipogenesis [2-14C]-pyruvate [3H]acetate, without effect GH-induced 2-deoxy-D-[1-3H]glucose uptake, JAK2 phosphorylation antilipolysis, suggesting unspecific effects mitochondrial metabolism rather direct effect GH-mediated signal. Tyrphostin 25 herbimycin effect parameters studied, except slight increase JAK2 phosphorylation response tyrphostin 25. summary, data support role JAK2 mediating insulin-like effects GH adipocytes.
