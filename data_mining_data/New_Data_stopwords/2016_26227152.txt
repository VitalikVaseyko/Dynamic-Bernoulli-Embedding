 present study aimed investigate role mechanistic target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulation myofibrillar (MyoPS) mitochondrial (MitoPS) protein synthesis following endurance exercise. Forty-two female C57BL/6 mice performed 1 h treadmill running (18 min(-1) ; 5 degrees grade), 1 h i.p. administration rapamycin (1.5 mg . kg(-1) ) vehicle. quantify skeletal muscle protein fractional synthesis rates, flooding dose (50 mg . kg(-1) ) l-[ring-(13) C6 ]phenylalanine administered via i.p. injection. Blood gastrocnemius muscle collected non-exercised control mice, well 0.5, 3 6 h completing exercise (n = 4 per time point). Skeletal muscle MyoPS MitoPS determined measuring isotope incorporation respective protein pools. Activation mTORC1-signalling cascade measured via direct kinase activity assay immunoblotting, whereas genes related mitochondrial biogenesis measured via quantitative RT-PCR. MyoPS increased rapidly vehicle group post-exercise remained elevated 6 h, whereas response transiently blunted (30 min post-exercise) rapamycin. contrast, MitoPS unaffected rapamycin, increased entire post-exercise recovery period groups (P < 0.05). Despite rapid increases MyoPS MitoPS, mTORC1 activation suppressed groups post-exercise entire 6 h recovery period. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mitochondrial transcription factor mRNA increased post-exercise (P < 0.05) response augmented rapamycin (P < 0.05). Collectively, data suggest endurance exercise stimulates MyoPS MitoPS skeletal muscle independently mTORC1 activation.
