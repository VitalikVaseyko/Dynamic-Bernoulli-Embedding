 ability cells migrate essential different physiological processes including embryonic development, angiogenesis, tissue repair immune response. context cancer abilities acquire dramatic implications, exploited tumor cells invade neighboring distant healthy tissues. 3-Phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1 PDPK1) ancient serine-threonine kinase belonging AGC kinase family. increasing amount data points pivotal role PDK1 regulation cell migration. PDK1 transducer PI3K signaling activates multiple downstream effectors, thereby representing essential hub coordinating signals coming extracellular cues cytoskeletal machinery, final executor cell movement. Akt, PAK1, beta3 integrin, ROCK1, MRCKalpha PLCgamma1 are, according literature, signaling transducers PDK1 regulates cell migration. addition, PDK1 contributes tumor cell invasion regulating invadopodia formation amoeboid collective cancer cell invasion. pieces evidence, reported overexpression across several tumor types, corroborate PDK1 role tumor aggressiveness. Altogether, findings indicate possibility rationally target PDK1 human tumors order counteract cancer cell dissemination organism.
