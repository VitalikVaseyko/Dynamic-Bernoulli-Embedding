 BACKGROUND: Obtaining quantitative predictions cellular metabolic activities requires identification modeling physicochemical constraints relevant physiological growth conditions. Molecular crowding cell's cytoplasm one potential constraint, limits solvent capacity available metabolic enzymes. RESULTS: Using recently introduced flux balance modeling framework (FBAwMC) demonstrate constraint determines metabolic switch E. coli cells shifted low high growth rates. switch characterized change effective optimization strategy, excretion acetate high growth rates, global reorganization E. coli metabolic fluxes, latter partially confirmed flux measurements central metabolic reactions. CONCLUSION: results implicate solvent capacity important physiological constraint acting E. coli cells operating high metabolic rates activation metabolic switch shifted low high growth rates. relevance constraint context aerobic ethanol excretion seen fast growing yeast cells (Crabtree effect) aerobic glycolysis observed rapidly dividing cancer cells (Warburg effect) addressed future.
