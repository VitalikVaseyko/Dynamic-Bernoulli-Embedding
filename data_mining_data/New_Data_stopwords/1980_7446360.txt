 hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, metabolic responses dogs acute myocardial ischemia intravenous administration fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) assessed. Analysis results (compared dextrose control) revealed evidence major improvement LVEDP cardiac output, significant decrease ST segment, large increases ATP CP ischemic district lesser degree normally perfused myocardium. results indicate FDP intervenes Embden-Meyerhof pathway high energy substrate also metabolic regulator influencing activity phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. FDP also stimulates glycolysis dog erythrocytes increases ATP 2-3 DPG content factor 2. significant finding studies biochemical intervention appears restore depressed activity glycolysis ischemic myocardium.
