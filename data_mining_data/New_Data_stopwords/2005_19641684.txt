 BACKGROUND: present review examines role intra-cellular compartmentation energy metabolism vivo. OBJECTIVE: compare kinetics activation mitochondrial respiration skinned cardiac fibres exogenous endogenous adenine nucleotides dependence modulation cellular structure contraction. METHODS: Saponin-permeabilized cardiac fibres cells analyzed using oxygraphy confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Mitochondria respiration fibres cells upregulated cumulative additions ADP medium apparent K(m) 200 muM 300 muM. respiration stimulated endogenous ADP produced intracellular ATPases, near maximum respiration rate achieved ADP concentration less 20 muM medium. powerful ADP-consuming system, consisting pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate, totally suppressed activation respiration exogenous ADP, failed abolish stimulation respiration endogenous ADP, inhibit respiration cells treated trypsin. addition 4 muM free Ca(2+) actively respiring fibres resulted reversible hypercontraction associated decreased apparent K(m) exogenous ADP. changes fully abolished fibres removal myosin KCl treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondria ATPases, together cytoskeletal proteins establish structural links mitochondria sarcomeres, form complexes - intracellular energetic units (ICEUs) - cardiac cells. Within ICEUs, mitochondria ATPases interact via specialized energy transfer systems, creatine kinase- adenylate kinase-phosphotransfer networks, direct ATP channelling. Disintegration structure function ICEUs results dyscompartmentation adenine nucleotides may represent basis cardiac diseases.
