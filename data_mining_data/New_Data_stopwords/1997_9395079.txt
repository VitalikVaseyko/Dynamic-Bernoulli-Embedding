 previously demonstrated that, hepatocytes primary culture, role insulin induction L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene expression mainly induce glucokinase synthesis, needed glucose phosphorylation glucose 6-phosphate. However, show hepatocytes isolated rats starved 72 h, glucose constitutive glucokinase expression sufficient fully stimulate L-PK promoter, low insulin concentrations still required. addition, activation remains sensitive cAMP inhibition, cannot reproduced absence insulin competitive cAMP antagonist. propose insulin cAMP act expression L-PK gene at, least, two levels: positive negative regulation glucokinase gene expression, downstream levels.
