 recently reported first evidence placental endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathophysiology human intrauterine growth restriction. Here, used mouse model investigate potential underlying mechanisms. Eif2s1(tm1RjK) mice, Ser51 eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2alpha) mutated, display 30% increase basal translation. Eif2s1(tm1RjK) placentas, observed increased ER stress anomalous accumulation glycoproteins endocrine junctional zone (Jz), labyrinthine zone physiological exchange occurs. Placental fetal weights reduced 15% (97 mg 82 mg, p < 0.001) 20% (1009 mg 798 mg, p < 0.001), respectively. investigate whether ER stress affects bioactivity secreted proteins, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived Eif2s1(tm1RjK) mutants. MEFs exhibited ER stress, grew 50% slower, showed reduced Akt-mTOR signalling compared wild-type cells. Conditioned medium (CM) derived Eif2s1(tm1RjK) MEFs failed maintain trophoblast stem cells progenitor state, effect could rescued exogenous application FGF4 heparin. addition, ER stress promoted accumulation pro-Igf2 altered glycosylation CM without affecting cellular levels, indicating protein failed processed release. Igf2 major growth factor placental development; indeed, activity Pdk1-Akt-mTOR pathways decreased Eif2s1(tm1RjK) placentas, indicating loss Igf2 signalling. Furthermore, observed premature differentiation trophoblast progenitors E9.5 mutant placentas, consistent vitro results disproportionate development labyrinth Jz seen placentas E18.5. Similar disproportion reported Igf2-null mouse. results demonstrate ER stress adversely affects placental development, modulation post-translational processing, hence bioactivity, secreted growth factors contributes effect. Placental dysmorphogenesis potentially affects fetal growth reduced exchange capacity.
