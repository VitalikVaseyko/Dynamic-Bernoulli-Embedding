 Cancer cells elevated aerobic glycolysis termed Warburg effect. several tumor cells, including leukemic cells, also increase glutamine metabolism, initiated glutaminase (GLS). microRNA (miRNA) miR-23 targets GLS mRNA inhibits expression GLS protein. show human leukemic Jurkat cells NF-kappaB p65 subunit binds miR-23a promoter inhibits miR-23a expression. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors release p65-induced inhibition. Jurkat cells growing glutamine decrease proliferation due cell accumulation G0/G1 phase. Nevertheless, cells get used new source energy increasing GLS expression, correlates increase p65 expression translocation nucleus, leading higher basal NF-kappaB activity. Jurkat cells overexpressing p65 show increase basal GLS expression proliferate faster control cells glutamine medium. Overexpressing miR-23a leukemic cells impaired glutamine use induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading cell death. Therefore, p65 activation decreases miR-23a expression, facilitates glutamine consumption allowing leukemic cells use alternative source carbon favoring adaptation metabolic environment.
