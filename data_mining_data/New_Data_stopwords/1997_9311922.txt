 Chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1), protein shares sequence similarities karyopherin beta family proteins involved nuclear import pathway, shown form complex leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES). interaction inhibited leptomycin B, drug prevents function CRM1 protein yeast. analyze role CRM1-NES interaction nuclear export, transport assay based semipermeabilized cells developed. system, reconstituted NES-, cytosol-, energy-dependent nuclear export, leptomycin B specifically blocked export NES-containing proteins. Thus, CRM1 protein could act NES receptor involved nuclear protein export.
