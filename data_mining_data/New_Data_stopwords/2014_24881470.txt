 BACKGROUND: Postoperative fatigue syndrome (POFS) common clinical complication followed almost every major abdominal surgery. Ginsenoside Rb1 (GRb1), principle ginsenoside ginseng, could exert potent anti-fatigue effect POFS. However, mechanism still unknown. Previous studies revealed alterations energy metabolism skeletal muscle may play vital role development progression fatigue. present study, investigate effect GRb1 energy metabolism skeletal muscle rat model POFS induced major small intestinal resection. METHODS: GRb1 (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally administrated daily 1, 3, 7, 10 operation day, respectively. locomotor activity recorded every day, total food intake calculated starting 24 h surgery. GRb1 treatment completed, blood skeletal muscle sampled. level blood glucose determined automatic biochemical analyzer. content adenosine triphosphate (ATP) skeletal muscle determined high-performance liquid chromatography. activity energy metabolic enzymes Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) assessed commercially available kits. RESULTS: results revealed GRb1 could increase locomotor activity POFS rats significantly increase total food intake postoperatively (P < 0.05). Furthermore, GRb1 also significantly increased ATP content skeletal muscle POFS rats (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, activity Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase SDH skeletal muscle POFS rats enhanced GRb1 (P < 0.05). However, significant differences blood glucose pyruvate kinase found POFS GRb1 treatment rats (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: results suggest GRb1 may improve skeletal muscle energy metabolism POFS, underlying mechanism may associated increase content ATP enhancement activity energy metabolic enzymes Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase ATPase SDH skeletal muscle.
