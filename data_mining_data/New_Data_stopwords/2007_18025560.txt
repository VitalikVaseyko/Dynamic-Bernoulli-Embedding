 Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2) allosteric activator two key enzymes glycolysis: phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Regulation glycolysis wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinant Escherichia coli dead-end structural analog F-1,6-P2 studied. 2,5-Anhydromannitol (2,5-AM), structural analog beta-d-fructose, used. taken cells, 2,5-AM converted monophosphate diphosphate enzymes glycolytic pathway. final product, 2,5-anhydromannitol-1,6-bisphosphate, could metabolized and, therefore, accumulated inside cells. Glucose fructose used substrates. found 2,5-AM concentrations 1 mM less effect either substrate consumption ethanol production. concentrations 2,5-AM 2.5 mM greater, significant inhibition glucose fructose observed, fructose inhibition much severe. discuss possible mechanisms glycolysis inhibition 2,5-AM high concentrations regulation glycolysis compound.
