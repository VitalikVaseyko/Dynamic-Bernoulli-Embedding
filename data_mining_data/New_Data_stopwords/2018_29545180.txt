 Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) caused deficiency glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-alpha G6PC), key enzyme endogenous glucose production. autosomal recessive disorder characterized impaired glucose homeostasis long-term complications hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC). shown hepatic G6Pase-alpha deficiency-mediated steatosis leads defective autophagy frequently associated carcinogenesis. show hepatic G6Pase-alpha deficiency also leads enhancement hepatic glycolysis hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) contribute hepatocarcinogenesis. enhanced hepatic glycolysis reflected increased lactate accumulation, increased expression many glycolytic enzymes, elevated expression c-Myc stimulates glycolysis. increased HMS reflected increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity elevated production NADPH reduced glutathione. previously shown restoration hepatic G6Pase-alpha expression G6Pase-alpha-deficient liver corrects metabolic abnormalities, normalizes autophagy, prevents HCA/HCC development GSD-Ia. show restoration hepatic G6Pase-alpha expression normalizes glycolysis HMS GSD-Ia. Moreover, HCA/HCC lesions L-G6pc-/- mice exhibit elevated levels hexokinase 2 (HK2) M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) play important role aerobic glycolysis cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, hepatic G6Pase-alpha deficiency causes metabolic reprogramming, leading enhanced glycolysis elevated HMS along impaired autophagy contribute HCA/HCC development GSD-Ia.
