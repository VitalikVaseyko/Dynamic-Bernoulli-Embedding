 1. proton-transfer reactions yeast pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) studied. Proton-transfer C-3 phosphoenolpyruvate water occurs presence phosphoryl-acceptor ADP. Proton transfer C-3 pyruvate water occurs presence ATP. However, proton transfer latter case occurs 10-100 times faster phosphoryl transfer; supports mechanism proton transfer precedes phosphoryl transfer reverse reaction pyruvate kinase. 2. characteristics proton-transfer reactions yeast pyruvate kinase compared previously reported rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (Robinson, JL. Rose, I.A. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 1096-1105). pH-profiles divalent cation dependencies similar Fru-1,6-P2-activated yeast pyruvate kinase muscle enzyme. Pyruvate enolization yeast pyruvate kinase absolute requirement ATP contrast enolization muscle enzyme proceeds ATP replaced Pi dianions. 3. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate shown affect catelytic steps yeast pyruvate kinase addition binding substrates. role depends divalent cation used activate enzyme.
