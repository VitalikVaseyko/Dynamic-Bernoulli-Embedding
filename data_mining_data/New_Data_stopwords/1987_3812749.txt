 compared perfluorochemical emulsion Fluosol-43 erythrocyte-based solution support media ex vivo working rabbit hearts functioning physiological workload. groups hearts (n = 5/group) exhibited stable function (left ventricular peak systolic pressure, peak rates left ventricular pressure rise relaxation, aortic flow, peak aortic flow rate, stroke work, peak power) first 6 h perfusion. Coronary flow, coronary venous O2 content, O2 supply-to-demand ratio declined similarly groups first 6 h. groups hearts preferentially utilized pyruvate glucose. Fluosol-43-perfused hearts higher heart rate, left ventricular peak systolic pressure, peak rate left ventricular pressure rise, aortic flow, coronary flow, myocardial O2 consumption compared erythrocyte-perfused hearts. Fluosol-43 hearts produced lactate released creatine phosphokinase erythrocyte-perfused hearts, rates low constant throughout perfusion, indicating hearts progressively ischemic. first 6 h, function Fluosol-43 hearts declined, resulting earlier failure compared erythrocyte-perfused hearts. data indicate Fluosol-43 sufficient O2- carrying capacity support stable function rabbit heart physiological workload 6 h, differences function ex vivo longevity two groups hearts suggested component contaminant Fluosol-43 altered sarcolemmal function and/or component needed membrane integrity lacking Fluosol-43 perfusate.
