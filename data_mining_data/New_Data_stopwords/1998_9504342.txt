 protozoan parasite, Giardia duodenalis, shares many metabolic genetic attributes bacteria, including fermentative energy metabolism relies heavily pyrophosphate rather adenosine triphosphate result contains two typically bacterial glycolytic enzymes pyrophosphate dependent. Pyruvate decarboxylation subsequent electron transport yet unidentified anaerobic electron acceptors relies eubacterial-like pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase archaebacterial/eubacterial-like ferredoxin. presence another 2-ketoacid oxidoreductase (with preference alpha-ketobutyrate) multiple ferredoxins Giardia also trait shared anaerobic bacteria. Giardia pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase distinct pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex invariably found mitochondria. consistent lack mitochondria, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation glutathione Giardia. Giardia duodenalis actively consumes oxygen yet lacks conventional mechanisms oxidative stress management, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, glutathione cycling, present eukaryotes. place Giardia contains prokaryotic H2O-producing NADH oxidase, membrane-associated NADH peroxidase, broad-range prokaryotic thioredoxin reductase-like disulphide reductase low molecular weight thiols, cysteine, thioglycolate, sulphite coenzyme A. NADH oxidase major component electron transport pathway Giardia which, conjunction disulphide reductase, protects oxygen-labile proteins ferredoxin pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase oxidative stress maintaining reduced intracellular environment. terminal oxidase, NADH oxidase provides means removing excess H+, thereby enabling continued pyruvate decarboxylation resultant production acetate adenosine triphosphate. example bacterial-like metabolism Giardia utilisation amino acid arginine energy source. Giardia contain arginine dihydrolase pathway, occurs number anaerobic prokaryotes, eukaryotes apart trichomonads Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. pathway includes substrate level phosphorylation sufficiently active make major contribution adenosine triphosphate production. Two enzymes pathway, arginine deiminase carbamate kinase, rare eukaryotes occur higher animals. Arginine transported trophozoite via bacterial-like arginine:ornithine antiport. Together metabolic pathways Giardia provide wide range potential drug targets future consideration.
