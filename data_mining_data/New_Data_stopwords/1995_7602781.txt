 Pyruvate kinase (PK) key glycolytic enzyme two structural genes; L/R-gene encodes L- R-type PK, whereas M-gene encodes M1- M2-type isozymes. isozyme switches M2 R-type erythroid differentiation, recent results showed switching achieved activation R-PK promoter activity involvement erythroid-specific transcription factors demonstrated. Glycolysis major energy source red cells, therefore, PK deficiency results hemolysis. PK deficiency common glycolytic enzyme defect associated hereditary hemolytic anemia, inherited autosomal recessive manner. date, 46 gene mutations identified, molecular approach might helpful diagnosis PK deficiency, particularly among transfusion-dependent subjects infantile cases.
