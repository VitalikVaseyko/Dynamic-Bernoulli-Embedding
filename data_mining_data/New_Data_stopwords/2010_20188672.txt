 A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) coordinate cell signaling events. AKAP79 brings together different combinations enzyme binding partners customize regulation effector proteins. neurons, muscarinic agonists mobilize AKAP79-anchored pool PKC phosphorylates KCNQ2 subunit channel. inhibits potassium permeability enhance neuronal excitability. Using dual fluorescent imaging/patch-clamp technique, visualized AKAP79-anchored PKC phosphorylation kinase activity reporter CKAR concurrently electrophysiological changes KCNQ2 channels show AKAP79 synchronizes signaling events optimize attenuation currents. AKAP79 also protects PKC certain ATP-competitive inhibitors. Related studies suggest context-dependent protein-protein interactions alter susceptibility another protein kinase, PDK1, ATP analog inhibitors. implies intracellular binding partners couple individual molecular events cell signaling process also change pharmacological profile certain protein kinases.
