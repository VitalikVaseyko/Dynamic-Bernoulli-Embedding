 OBJECTIVE: investigate effect utero exposure di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) protein expression penile tissue hypospadiac rats, isolate identify differentially expressed proteins, determine role differential expression Annexin A3 development hypospadia rat offspring maternal exposure DBP. METHODS: Twenty pregnant SD rats randomly assigned experimental group, intragastrically administered DBP 800 mg/kg, control group, given soybean oil 5 ml/kg, 5 days. Three days birth, penises newborn rats removed, total protein extracted 2D-electrophoretic separation image analysis. Differentially expressed protein spots screened identified mass spectrometry, changes expression Annexin A3 detected Western blotting immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Thirty-one differentially expressed protein spots screened, 17 identified mass spectrometry SwissProt database, including pyruvate kinase M2, alpha-enolase, Annexin A3. Western blot showed Annexin A3 mainly located urethral epithelia lower expression hypospadiac rats (1.851 +/- 0.014, n = 10) controls (2.603 +/- 0.012, n = 10) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: pedigree differentially expressed proteins penises DBP-induced hypospadia normal rats established proteomic method. differential expression Annexin A3 may play important role development hypospadia.
