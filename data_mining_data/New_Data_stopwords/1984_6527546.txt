 predominance adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) couple cellular phosphorylation reactions, including form basis cellular energy metabolism, cannot explained thermodynamic grounds since variety "high energy phosphate" compounds (including ADP itself) found cell would, based thermodynamic considerations, least effective ATP serving phosphoryl donor. present-day organisms come rely ATP/ADP couple principal mediator phosphorylation reactions? early appearance adenine compounds prebiotic environment suggested experiments indicating that, relative purine pyridimine compounds, adenine derivatives preferentially synthesized simulated prebiotic conditions (Ponnamperuma et al., 1963). addition roles adenine nucleotides phosphorylation reactions, adenine derivatives (e.g. Coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, puridine nucleotides) employed variety metabolic roles. principal function adenine moiety latter cases binding derivatives relevant enzyme. capability binding adenine moiety appears arisen early evolution exploited multitude contexts, suggestion consistent observed similarities binding sites several enzymes employing adenine derivatives substrate. early availability suitable adenine compounds biosphere development complementary binding sites cellular proteins, coupled expected advantages limited number metabolites central mediators endergonic exergonic metabolism could readily led observed pre-eminence adenine nucleotides cellular energy metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
