 Lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) removes methyl groups mono- di-methylated lysine 4 histone H3. Previous studies linked LSD1 malignancy several human tumors, LSD1 considered epigenetically regulate energy metabolism genes adipocytes hepatocellular carcinoma. study investigates function LSD1 invasive activity metabolism esophageal cancer cells. investigated whether LSD1 immunohistochemical expression levels related clinical pathological features, including maximum standard uptake value fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography assay. influence LSD1 cell proliferation, invasion glucose uptake evaluated vitro using specific small interfering RNA LSD1, LSD1 inhibitor. also evaluated two major energy pathways (glycolytic pathway mitochondrial respiration) measuring extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) extracellular flux analyzer. High LSD1 immunohistochemical expression significantly associated high tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, poor prognosis, high maximum standard uptake value esophageal cancer patients. vitro analysis, LSD1 knockdown significantly suppressed invasive activity glucose uptake cancerous cells, reduced ECAR increased OCR OCR/ECAR. LSD1 may contribute malignant behavior regulating invasive activity metabolism, activating glycolytic pathway inhibiting mitochondrial respiration esophageal cancer cells. results support LSD1 potential therapeutic target.
