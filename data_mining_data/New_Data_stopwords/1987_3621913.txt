 1. Kinetic regulatory properties pyruvate kinase studied haemolysates erythrocytic populations blood bone marrow rats. 2. Pyruvate kinase normal rat erythrocytes showed sigmoidal kinetics vs phosphoenolpyruvate. contrast, enzyme reticulocytes erythroid-rich bone marrow cells behaved hyperbolic. 3. enzyme activities always inhibited ATP. Activation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate observed erythrocytes. 4. kinetic differences suggest changes pyruvate kinase isozymes cells erythrocytic line rats.
