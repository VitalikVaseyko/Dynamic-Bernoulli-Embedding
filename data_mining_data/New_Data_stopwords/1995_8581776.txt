 Wistar fatty rat model obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Males, females, develop hyperglycemia, glucouria polyuria within 8 weeks age. regulation gene expression insulin shown differentially impaired liver fatty rats. genes resistant insulin include glucokinase gene phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. contrast, L-type pyruvate kinase gene responds insulin normally, raising possibility signaling pathway insulin receptor insulin-resistant genes, insulin-sensitive genes, defective point beyond receptor kinase fatty rats. hand, female fatty rats develop hyperglycemia given sucrose several weeks. treatment causes decrease gucokinase enzymes involved gluconeogenesis increased. Chronic feeding sucrose also leads hypertriglycemia visceral fat accumulation, frequently associated abnormalities glucose lipid metabolisms. Fructose believed responsible component sucrose effects. Hypertriglyceridemic effect fructose mainly due increase hepatic production VLDL. enzymes related lipogenesis liver induced dietary fructose even diabetes. L-type pyruvate kinase one enzymes. Cis-acting element named PKL-III 5'-flanking region gene shown responsive dietary fructose well dietary glucose. Thus, identification characterization protein bound element could help understanding molecular mechanism fructose actions.
