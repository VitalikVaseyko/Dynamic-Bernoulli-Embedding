 activity enzymes given metabolic pathway modulated multiple mechanisms, operate simultaneous coherent way produce either stimulation inhibition. operation mechanisms illustrated several enzymes involved glucose metabolism, choosing examples presentations Symposium. Thus reciprocal interactions regulatory mechanisms acting upon hexokinase ('glucokinase'), phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase pyruvate kinase discussed, well relationships induction enzyme conformational changes. addition, effects covalent interconversions glutamine synthetase activity briefly analyzed. outstanding feature exhibited enzymes display great number elasticity coefficients, differential quotients measuring dependence enzymatic activity variable modulates it. general assumption enzymes make important contribution control metabolic flux participate. flux control, however, appears shared different degrees components system, may quantified differential quotient denominated control coefficient. problems emerge attempt estimate coefficients living cells discussed. problems derive partly complex subcellular structure, formation functional compartments resulting reversible association enzymes, one another different cellular components, actual state cell water. problems make results obtained purified highly diluted enzymes enzymological studies extrapolated directly happens vivo, without careful evaluation particular case. regulatory role enzyme activity fructose 2,6-bisphosphate eventual participation intermediary hormonal control glycolytic gluconeogenic fluxes emphasized. regulation yeast fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activity discussed relation eventual role allosteric modulators covalents interconversions signals initiation intracellular degradation enzyme catabolic inactivation.
