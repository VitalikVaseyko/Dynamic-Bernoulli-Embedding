 Various isoforms glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase expressed different cell-types. One isoforms, type Tu M2-PK, strongly overexpressed tumor cells released body fluids. concentration Tu M2-PK body fluids quantitatively determined commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-kit. Using kit, Tu M2-PK concentration measured EDTA-plasma 64 patients renal carcinoma 10 patients suffering nephritis. ranges Tu M2-PK-concentrations two groups overlap, indicating highly significant discrimination renal carcinoma benign renal diseases. Furthermore, Tu M2-PK-concentration EDTA-plasma correlates strongly Robson tumor stage 64 patients. present results indicate Tu M2-PK might first tumor marker could excellent complementation diagnostic program renal carcinoma.
