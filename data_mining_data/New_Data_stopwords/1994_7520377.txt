 Antibodies serum patients autoimmune diseases used identify human autoantigens. autoantibodies often recognize active sites within corresponding protein antigens, autoantibodies facilitated functional characterization polypeptides. present study, serum patient Sjogren's syndrome used identify novel autoantigen designated Ge-1. Using patient's serum, 4.8-kb cDNA encoding Ge-1 identified. Fragments cDNA ligated prokaryotic expression vectors, expressed Escherichia coli, used produce recombinant Ge-1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins containing different portions Ge-1 used identify 58 amino acid immunoreactive region within protein. immunoreactive region contained protein's putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS). demonstrate immunoreactive region capable functioning NLS, eukaryotic expression plasmid constructed encode immunoreactive region fused cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. transfection plasmid COS-1 cells, fusion protein detected nucleus. presence NLS motif within immunoreactive region Ge-1 nuclear autoantigens suggests NLS may target human autoantibodies.
