 erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentrations sheep change markedly 1st mo following birth. measurements erythrocyte glycolytic enzymes intermediate concentrations, identified mechanism regulating erythrocyte 2,3-DPG postnatal sheep. postnatal changes erythrocyte 2,3-DPG result qualitative quantitative changes intracellular activities Rapoport-Luebering shunt enzymes, 2,3-DPG mutase 2,3-DPG phosphatase. postnatal 2,3-DPG changes result changes erythrocyte concentration 1,3-DPG, controlled reactions glycolytic pathway. Neither changes glycolytic control enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) changes intrinsic glycolytic rate account 1,3-DPG concentration changes. 1,3-DPG concentrations regulated vivo glycolytic rate, controlled intracellular concentration glucose, glycolytic substrate. Glucose concentrations 0.3 mmol/l cells erythrocytes fetal sheep (135-140 days gestational age), increase following birth peak 3.8 mmol/l cells 1st wk age, decline normal adult levels 0.5 mmol/l cells end 1st mo.
