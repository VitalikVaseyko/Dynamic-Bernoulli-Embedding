 Iron essential nutrient organisms, actively involved oxygen delivery, electron transport, DNA synthesis, many biochemical reactions important cell survival. previously reported nickel (Ni) ion exposure decreases cellular iron level converts cytosolic aconitase (c-aconitase) iron-regulatory protein-1 A549 cells (Chen H, Davidson T, Singleton S, Garrick MD, Costa M. Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 206:275-287, 2005). Here, investigated effect Ni ion exposure activity mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) enzymes cellular energy metabolism. found acute Ni ion treatment 1 mM exhibits minimal toxicity A549 cells. Ni ion treatment decreases activity several Fe-S enzymes related cellular energy metabolism, including mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). Low doses Ni ion 4 weeks resulted increased cellular glycolysis NADH NAD+ (NADH/NAD+) ratio, although glycolysis inhibited higher levels. Collectively, results show Ni ions decrease activity cellular iron (Fe)-containing enzymes, inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), increase cellular glycolytic activity. Since increased glycolysis one fundamental alterations energy metabolism cancer cells (the Warburg effect), inhibition Fe-S enzymes subsequent changes cellular energy metabolism caused Ni ions may play important role Ni carcinogenesis.
