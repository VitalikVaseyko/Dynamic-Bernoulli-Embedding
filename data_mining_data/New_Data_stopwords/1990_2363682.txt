 1. Glutamine found main carbon nitrogen product metabolism aspartate isolated guinea-pig kidney-cortex tubules. Glutamate, ammonia alanine minor products. 2. Carbon-balance calculations release 14CO2 [U-14C]aspartate indicate oxidation aspartate carbon skeleton occurred. 3. pathway involving aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase enzymes tricarboxylic acid cycle proposed conversion aspartate glutamine. 4. Evidence pathway obtained by: (i) inhibiting aspartate removal amino-oxyacetate, inhibitor transaminases, (ii) use methionine sulphoximine, inhibitor glutamine synthetase, induced large increase ammonia release aspartate, (iii) use quinolinate, inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, inhibited glutamine synthesis aspartate, (iv) use alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, inhibitor mitochondrial transport pyruvate, caused accumulation pyruvate aspartate, (v) use fluoroacetate, inhibitor aconitase, inhibited glutamine synthesis concomitant accumulation citrate aspartate.
