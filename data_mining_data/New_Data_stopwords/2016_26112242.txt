 determined effects "periodized nutrition" skeletal muscle whole body responses bout prolonged exercise following morning. Seven cyclists completed two trials receiving isoenergetic diets differing timing ingestion: consumed either 8 g/kg body mass (BM) carbohydrate (CHO) undertaking evening session high-intensity training (HIT) slept without eating (FASTED), consumed 4 g/kg BM CHO HIT, 4 g/kg BM CHO sleeping (FED). next morning subjects completed 2 h cycling (120SS) overnight fasted. Muscle biopsies taken day 1 (D1) 2 h HIT day 2 (D2) pre-, post-, 4 h 120SS. Muscle [glycogen] higher FED times post-HIT (P < 0.001). cycling bouts increased PGC1alpha mRNA PDK4 mRNA (P < 0.01) trials, PDK4 mRNA elevated greater extent FASTED (P < 0.05). Resting phosphorylation AMPK(Thr172), p38MAPK(Thr180/Tyr182), p-ACC(Ser79) (D2) greater FASTED (P < 0.05). Fat oxidation 120SS higher FASTED (P = 0.01), coinciding increases ACC(Ser79) CPT1 well mRNA expression CD36 FABP3 (P < 0.05). Methylation gene promoter COX4I1 FABP3 increased 4 h 120SS trials, whereas methylation PPARdelta promoter increased FASTED. provide evidence shifts DNA methylation correspond inverse changes transcription metabolically adaptive genes, although delaying postexercise feeding failed augment markers mitochondrial biogenesis.
