 OBJECTIVE: study investigated effects different dietary energy sources early postmortem muscle metabolism finishing pigs. METHODS: Seventy-two barrow (DurocxLandracexYorkshire, DLY) pigs (65.0+/-2.0 kg) allotted three iso-energetic iso-nitrogenous diets: (44.1% starch, 5.9% crude fat, 12.6% neutral detergent fibre [NDF]), B (37.6% starch, 9.5% crude fat, 15.4% NDF) C (30.9% starch, 14.3% crude fat, 17.8% NDF). duration 28-day feeding experiment, 24 pigs (eight per treatment) slaughtered M. longissimus lumborum (LL) samples 45 min postmortem collected. RESULTS: Compared diet A, diet C resulted greater adenosine triphosphate decreased phosphocreatine (PCr) concentrations, greater activity creatine kinase reduced percentage bound activities hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) muscles (p<0.05). Moreover, diet C decreased phosphor-AKT level increased hydroxy-hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) level, well decreased bound protein expressions HK II, PKM2, lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Diet C lowest level starch highest levels fat NDF could enhance PCr utilization attenuate glycolysis early postmortem muscle finishing pigs.
