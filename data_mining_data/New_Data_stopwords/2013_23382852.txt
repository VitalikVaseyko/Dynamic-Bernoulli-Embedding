 BACKGROUND: Preterm Birth (PTB) major cause neonatal mortality morbidity. Women Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) high risk PTB. need research studies investigate mechanisms linking PCOS PTB, facilitate screening, develop novel preventative strategies. OBJECTIVE: list proteomic biomarkers PTB integrate list PCOS biomarker database identify commonly expressed biomarkers two conditions. SEARCH STRATEGY: systematic review PTB biomarkers update PCOS biomarker database. eligible published studies proteomic biomarkers PTB PCOS identified various databases evaluated. SELECTION CRITERIA: identification relevant studies, following search terms used: "proteomics", "proteomic", "preterm birth", "preterm labour", "proteomic biomarker" "polycystic ovary syndrome". search restricted humans DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS: database proteomic biomarkers PTB created already existing PCOS biomarker database updated. two databases integrated biomarkers co-expressed women PCOS PTB identified investigated. RESULTS: panel six proteomic biomarkers similarly differentially expressed women PTB women PCOS compared respective controls (normal age-matched women case PCOS studies women term pregnancy case PTB studies). biomarkers include Pyruvate kinase M1/M2, Vimentin, Fructose bisphosphonate aldolase A, Heat shock protein beta-1, Peroxiredoxin-1 Transferrin. CONCLUSIONS: proteomic biomarkers (Pyruvate kinase M1/M2, Vimentin, Fructose bisphosphonate aldolase A, Heat shock protein beta-1, Peroxiredoxin-1 Transferrin) potentially used better understand pathophysiological mechanisms linking PCOS PTB. would help identify subgroups women PCOS risk PTB hence potential developing preventative strategies.
