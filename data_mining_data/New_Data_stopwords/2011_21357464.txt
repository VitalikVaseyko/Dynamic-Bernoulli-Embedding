 OBJECTIVE: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) linked peripheral insulin resistance-a major predicament type 2 diabetes. study aims identify molecular mechanism DIO-triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes hepatic insulin resistance mouse models. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: C57BL/6 mice primary hepatocytes used evaluate role LIPIN2 ER stress-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, lipopolysaccharide used invoke acute ER stress conditions. promote chronic ER stress, mice fed high-fat diet 8-12 weeks. verify role LIPIN2 hepatic insulin signaling, adenoviruses expressing wild-type mutant LIPIN2, shRNA LIPIN2 used animal studies. Plasma glucose, insulin levels well hepatic free fatty acids, diacylglycerol (DAG), triacylglycerol assessed. Additionally, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, pyruvate tolerance tests performed evaluate metabolic phenotype mice. RESULTS: LIPIN2 expression enhanced mouse livers acute ER stress-inducers high-fat feeding. Transcriptional activation LIPIN2 ER stress mediated activating transcription factor 4, demonstrated LIPIN2 promoter assays, Western blot analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Knockdown hepatic LIPIN2 DIO mice reduced fasting hyperglycemia improved hepatic insulin signaling. Conversely, overexpression LIPIN2 impaired hepatic insulin signaling phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: results demonstrate ER stress-induced LIPIN2 would contribute perturbation hepatic insulin signaling via DAG-protein kinase C epsilon-dependent manner DIO mice.
