 MAIN CONCLUSION: Cotton cytosolic pyruvate kinase GhPK6 preferentially expressed late stage fiber elongation process, transgenic experiments indicated expression level negatively correlated cell expansion rate. Pyruvate kinase (PK) plays vital regulatory roles rapid cell growth mammals. However, function PK plant cell growth remains unclear. allotetraploid upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), total 33 PK genes encoded genome. Analysis transcriptome data indicated two cytosolic PK genes, GhPK6 duplicated gene GhPK26, preferentially expressed elongating cotton fiber cells. RT-qPCR western blot analyses revealed expression GhPK6 negatively correlated fiber elongation rate, well explains observed sharp increase cytosolic PK activity end fast fiber elongation process. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing GhPK6 cotton plants resulted increased fiber cell elongation reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. contrary, Arabidopsis plants ectopically expressing GhPK6 exhibited ROS-mediated growth inhibition, whereas addition ROS scavenging reagents could partly rescue inhibition. data collectively suggested GhPK6 might play important role regulating cotton fiber elongation ROS-dependent inhibition manner.
