 specific intracellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase antagonist, Rp-diastereomer adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS), inhibited basal cyclic AMP-agonist-induced rates gluconeogenesis hepatocytes isolated fasted rats. Incubation cells presence pyruvate lactate either Sp-diastereomer adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Sp-cAMPS) glucagon produced concentration-dependent increase rate gluconeogenic glucose production shifted higher concentrations Sp-cAMPS glucagon presence Rp-cAMPS. Incubation cells Rp-cAMPS absence agonist produced increase rate glucose production and, cases, 100 microM-Rp-cAMPS resulted 14-20% decrease substrate-stimulated rate glucose production. Sp-cAMPS-induced gluconeogenesis inhibited half-maximally 1 microM-Rp-cAMPS glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis inhibited half-maximally 12 microM-Rp-cAMPS. Approx. 10-15% inhibition gluconeogenesis observed presence Rp-cAMPS due conversion glucose 6-phosphate liver glycogen, consistent Rp-cAMPS-induced reactivation glycogen synthase. remaining 85-90% inhibition gluconeogenic glucose production resulted action Rp-cAMPS cyclic AMP-sensitive enzymes controlling rate gluconeogenesis.
