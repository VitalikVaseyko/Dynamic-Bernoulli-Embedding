 effects low concentrations phosphate (low-P) soluble protein content, activities 12 different enzymes, rates photosynthesis respiration basis leaf area investigated maize (Zea mays L.) leaves 16 24 days planting (DAP). low-P treatment, drastic decrease rate photosynthesis 6% maximum rate control plants observed 24 DAP. Low-P treatment almost effect rate respiration 21 DAP, rate respiration decreased progressively 55% maximum rate control plants. soluble protein content low-P plants decreased 56% maximum content control plants. changes activities enzymes low-P plants showed several different patterns. activities pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, catalase, phosphohexose isomerase, chloroplastic fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, ADP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase decreased steadily 85 100% maximum activity found 18- 21-day-old control plants (V(max)) 30 70% V(max). activity sucrose phosphate synthase remained virtually constant approximately 85 100% V(max). activity UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase remained almost constant 21 DAP decreased 80% V(max) 24 DAP. activity cytochrome c oxidase increased slightly 21 DAP decreased 50% V(max) 24 DAP. indicated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis soluble proteins, subunit PEPC stained less intensely 24-d-old low-P plants. possibility discussed low-P treatment selective degradation PEPC without concomitant degradation sucrose phosphate synthase, known localized cytoplasmic compartment mesophyll cells.
