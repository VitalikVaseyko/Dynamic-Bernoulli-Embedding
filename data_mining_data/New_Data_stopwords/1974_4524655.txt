 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) S. carlsbergensis tetrameric enzyme, composed four identical subunits contains 1 mole L-valine noncovalently bound. enzyme readily dissociates monomeric units. L-Valine magnesium manganese ions specific primers renaturation process enzyme. amino acid induces renaturation K(0.5) 17 muM pseudo first-order rate constant 0.019 min(-1) 25 degrees respect monomeric species, indicating L-valine influences folding monomeric form disordered state native conformation followed spontaneous reassociation formation tetrameric enzyme. Independently, magnesium manganese ions induce renaturation first-order rate constant magnitude.
