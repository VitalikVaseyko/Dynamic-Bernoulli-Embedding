 effect high-pressure processing (HPP) (150, 300 450 MPa 0, 2.5 5 min) total sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-soluble sarcoplasmic proteins frozen (-10 degrees C 3 months) horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) evaluated. Proteomics tools based image analysis SDS-PAGE protein gels protein identification tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) applied. Although total SDS-soluble fraction indicated important changes induced HPP, processing modified 1-D SDS-PAGE sarcoplasmic patterns direct-dependent manner exerted selective effect particular proteins depending processing conditions. Thus, application highest pressure (450 MPa) provoked significant degradation phosphoglycerate mutase 2, glycogen phosphorylase muscle form, pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme, beta-enolase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucomutase-1. Conversely, protein bands assigned tropomyosin alpha-1 chain, fast myotomal muscle troponin parvalbumin beta 2 increased intensity applying 450-MPa processing.
