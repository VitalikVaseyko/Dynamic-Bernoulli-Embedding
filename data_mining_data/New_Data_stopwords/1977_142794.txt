 Intraperitoneal transplantation collagenase-digested, isogeneic, neonatal rat pancreatic tissue successfully reversed streptozotocin-induced diabetes 77% recipients. low serum immunoreactive insulin, hyperglycaemia, glycosuria weight loss, characteristic diabetic animal, corrected reduced activities hepatic glucokinase pyruvate kinase, low glycogen concentration liver diabetic rats restored normal. Forty-three per cent successfully transplanted rats became normoglycaemic within 1 month transplantation whereas 57% took 1 6 months achieve normoglycaemia displayed mild glucose intolerance subjected glucose load. rats become normoglycaemic 6 months transplantation showed amelioration diabetic state, shown increased serum immunoreactive insulin hepatic glycogen concentration slow weight gain compared diabetic controls.
