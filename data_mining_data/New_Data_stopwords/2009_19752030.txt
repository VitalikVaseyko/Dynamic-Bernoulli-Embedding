 Knowledge vivo physiology metabolism Streptococcus pneumoniae limited, even though pneumococci rely efficient acquisition metabolism host nutrients growth survival. nutrient-limited, hypoxic host tissues favor mixed-acid fermentation, studied role pneumococcal pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), key enzyme mixed-acid fermentation, activated posttranslationally PFL-activating enzyme (PFL-AE). Mutations introduced two putative pfl genes, SPD0235 SPD0420, two putative pflA genes, SPD0229 SPD1774. End-product analysis showed formate, main end product reaction catalyzed PFL, produced mutants defective SPD0420 SPD1774, indicating SPD0420 codes PFL SPD1774 putative PFL-AE. Expression SPD0420 elevated galactose-containing medium anaerobiosis compared growth glucose, mutation SPD0420 resulted upregulation fba pyk, encoding, respectively, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase pyruvate kinase, conditions. addition, altered fatty acid composition detected SPD0420 SPD1774 mutants. Mice infected intranasally SPD0420 SPD1774 mutants survived significantly longer wild type-infected cohort, bacteremia developed later mutant cohort wild type-infected group. Furthermore, numbers CFU SPD0420 mutant lower nasopharynx lungs intranasal infection, fewer numbers mutant CFU wild-type CFU recovered blood specimens intravenous infection. results demonstrate direct link pneumococcal fermentative metabolism virulence.
