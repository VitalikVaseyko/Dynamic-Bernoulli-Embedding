 Cerebral pyruvate depletion lactate acidosis common metabolic characteristics patients traumatic brain injury (TBI) associated poor prognosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) rate-limiting enzyme coupling glycolysis mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Brain PDH activity regulated phosphorylation status effectors. Phosphorylation PDH E1alpha1 subunit PDH kinase inhibits PDH activity dephosphorylation phosphorylated PDHE1alpha1 PDH phosphatase (PDP1) restores PDH activity. situ hybridization showed PDP1 mRNA highly expressed cerebral cortex, hippocampus thalamus rat. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) induced significant increase PDP1 mRNA expression ipsilateral cerebral cortex 4 h (P<0.05) 24 h post CCI (P<0.01) returned basal level 72 h post CCI. PDP1 mRNA level increased transiently ipsilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus CA1-3 subfields 4 h post CCI (P<0.01) decreased significantly 24 h 72 h (P<0.01) post CCI, coinciding marked increase neuronal apoptosis ipsilateral hippocampus 24 h post CCI. PDP1 mRNA expression thalamus subcortical regions decreased persistently post CCI. Contralateral CCI craniotomy showed similar effects PDP1 mRNA expression ipsilateral CCI. GFAP mRNA expression induced brain regions PDP1 expression altered, study determine potential relationship astrocyte activation, PDP1 alteration, pyruvate metabolism following TBI.
