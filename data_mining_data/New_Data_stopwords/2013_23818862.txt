 sphingolipid ceramide elicits several stress responses, however, organisms survive despite increased ceramide poorly understood. demonstrate AKT/FOXO pathway regulates survival increased ceramide environment metabolic adaptation involving changes glycolysis lipolysis novel downstream targets. show ceramide kinase mutants accumulate ceramide leads reduction energy levels due compromised oxidative phosphorylation. Mutants show increased activation Akt consequent decrease FOXO levels. changes lead enhanced glycolysis upregulating activity phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase provide energy. second major consequence AKT/FOXO reprogramming mutants increased mobilization lipid gut novel lipase targets, CG8093 CG6277 energy contribution. Ubiquitous reduction targets knockdown experiments results semi total lethality mutants, demonstrating importance activating them. efficiency adaptive mechanisms decreases age leads reduction adult life span mutants. particular, mutants develop cardiac dysfunction age, likely reflecting high energy requirement well-functioning heart. lipases also regulate physiological triacylglycerol homeostasis important energy metabolism since midgut specific reduction wild type flies results increased sensitivity starvation accumulation triglycerides leading cardiac defects. central findings increased AKT activation, decreased FOXO level activation phosphoglyceromutase pyruvate kinase also observed mice heterozygous ceramide transfer protein suggesting conserved role pathway mammals. data reveal novel glycolytic non-autonomous lipolytic pathways response increased ceramide sustenance high energy demanding organ functions like heart.
