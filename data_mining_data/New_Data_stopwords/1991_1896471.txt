 cDNA clones human R-type pyruvate kinase (PK) isolated human reticulocyte cDNA library, constructed PCR single gene-specific primer. full-length cDNA 2060 base pairs long, cDNA encoded 574 amino acids, number rat R-type PK. Compared human L-type PK, R-type PK 31 amino acids longer amino terminus. also cloned characterized R-type PK cDNA clones patients hereditary hemolytic anemia PK deficiency, PK Tokyo. single nucleotide substitution (ACG ATG) found nucleotide 1151 coding sequence R-type PK, caused amino acid substitution, Thr384----Met. Dot blot hybridization PCR-amplified genomic DNA patients parents allele-specific oligonucleotide probes showed parents, second cousins, heterozygous. confirm nucleotide change responsible variant phenotype, expressed L-type PK single amino acid change Escherichia coli characterized enzyme. variant PK thermolabile moved slowly polyacrylamide gel buffered 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 8.3; characteristics fully compatible data obtained patient's PK. results, concluded enzymatic stability variant affected point mutation PK-encoding gene.
