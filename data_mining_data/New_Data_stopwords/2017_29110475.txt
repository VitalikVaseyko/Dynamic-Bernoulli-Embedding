 Preslaughter transport reported decrease quality breast meat thigh meat broilers. However, tissue-specific difference glycogen metabolism breast thigh muscles transported broilers well studied. thus investigated differences meat quality, adenosine phosphates, glycolysis, bound key enzymes associated glycolysis metabolism skeletal muscles different fiber types preslaughter transported broilers summer. Compared 0.5 h transport, 3 h transport summer decreased ATP content, increased AMP content AMP/ATP ratio, accelerated glycolysis metabolism via upregulation glycogen phosphorylase expression accompanied increased activities bound glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase) pectoralis major muscle, subsequently increased likelihood pale, soft, exudative-like breast meat. hand, 3 h transport induced moderate glycolysis metabolism tibialis anterior muscle, cause noticeable changes quality traits thigh meat.
