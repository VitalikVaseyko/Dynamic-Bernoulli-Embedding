 KEY POINTS: Maternal training gestation enhances offspring body composition energy substrates handling early adulthood. Offspring nutrition also plays role beneficial effects maternal training gestation disappear consumption high-fat diet. ABSTRACT: Maternal exercise gestation reported modify offspring metabolism health. Whether effects exacerbated offspring receiving high-fat diet remains unclear. purpose evaluate effect maternal exercise gestation offspring fed high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HF) assessing body composition, pancreatic function energy substrates handling two major glucose-utilizing tissues: liver muscle. Fifteen-week-old nulliparous female Wistar rats exercised 4 weeks well gestation constant submaximal intensity (TR) remained sedentary (CT). weaning, pups group fed either standard diet (TRCD CTCD) high-fat/high-sucrose diet (TRHF CTHF) 10 weeks. Offspring TR dams gained less weight compared CT dams. Selected fat depots larger HF diet compared control diet (CD) significantly smaller TRHF compared CTHF. Surprisingly, insulin secretion index higher islets HF offspring compared CD. TR offspring showed higher muscle insulin sensitivity estimated ratio phosphorylated protein kinase B total protein kinase B compared CT offspring (+48%, P < 0.05). CD, permeabilized isolated muscle fibres TR rats displayed lower apparent affinity constant (Km ) pyruvate palmitoyl coenzyme substrates compared CT group (-46% -58%, respectively, P < 0.05). results suggest maternal exercise positive effects young adult offspring body composition muscle carbohydrate lipid metabolism depending nutritional status.
