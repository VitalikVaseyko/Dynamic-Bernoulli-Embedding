 Dietary boron, amounts usually found human diets comprised mainly fruits vegetables, apparently affects mineral energy metabolism. Therefore, effects boron model system perturbed metabolic insulin-vitamin D3 axis examined. Weanling male rats fed ground corn-high protein casein-corn oil-based diet (0.06 micrograms B/g supplemental vitamin D3) supplemented B (as orthoboric acid) 0 2.4 mg/kg. 55 days, rats equilibrated individual metabolic cages. another 6 days, one half rats dietary groups injected intraperitoneally streptozotocin (STZ). rats killed 3 days STZ treatment. STZ affected many aspects energy metabolism. non-STZ rats, supplemental dietary boron substantially depressed plasma insulin, plasma pyruvate concentrations, creatine kinase activity increased plasma thyroxine (T4) concentrations. finding boron affect growth, affect several indices energy metabolism non-STZ animals suggests boron functions regulator energy metabolism rat. decrease plasma aspartate transaminase activity (an indicator enhanced cell membrane integrity) non-STZ rats suggests boron exerts protective influence normal liver metabolism.
