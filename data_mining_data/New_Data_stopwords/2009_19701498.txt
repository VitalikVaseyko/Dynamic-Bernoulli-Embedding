 Nowadays, cellular bioenergetics become central issue investigation cancer biology. Recently, metabolic activity cancer cell shown correlate proteomic index informs relative mitochondrial activity cell. Within new field investigation, report herein production characterization high-affinity monoclonal antibodies proteins "bioenergetic signature" cell. use recombinant proteins antibodies mitochondrial beta-F1-ATPase Hsp60 proteins enzymes glycolytic pathway glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase M2 quantitative assays provide, first time, actual amount proteins normal tumor surgical specimens breast, lung, esophagus. application methodology affords straightforward proteomic signature quantifies variable energetic demand human tissues. Furthermore, results show unanticipated finding: tumors different tissues and/or histological types proteomic signature energetic metabolism. Therefore, results indicate cancer abolishes tissue-specific differences bioenergetic phenotype mitochondria. Overall, results support energetic metabolism represents additional hallmark phenotype cancer cell promising target treatment diverse neoplasias.
