 Hanseniaspora uvarum (anamorph Kloeckera apiculata) predominant yeast wine grapes fruits strong influence wine quality, even Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter cultures employed. work, sequenced annotated approximately 93% H. uvarum genome. Southern synteny analyses employed construct map seven chromosomes present type strain. Comparative determinations specific enzyme activities within fermentative pathway H. uvarum S. cerevisiae indicated reduced capacity former yeast ethanol production caused primarily approximately 10-fold-lower activity key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. heterologous expression encoding gene, H. uvarumPYK1 (HuPYK1), two genes encoding phosphofructokinase subunits, HuPFK1 HuPFK2, respective deletion mutants S. cerevisiae confirmed functional homology.IMPORTANCEHanseniaspora uvarum predominant yeast species grapes fruits. contributes significantly production desired well unfavorable aroma compounds thus determines quality final product, especially wine. Despite obvious importance, knowledge genetics scarce. basis targeted metabolic modifications, provide results genomic sequencing approach, including annotation 3,010 protein-encoding genes, e.g., encoding entire sugar fermentation pathway, key components stress response signaling pathways, enzymes catalyzing production aroma compounds. Comparative analyses suggest low fermentative capacity H. uvarum compared Saccharomyces cerevisiae attributed low pyruvate kinase activity. data reported expected aid establishing H. uvarum non-Saccharomyces yeast starter cultures wine cider fermentations.
