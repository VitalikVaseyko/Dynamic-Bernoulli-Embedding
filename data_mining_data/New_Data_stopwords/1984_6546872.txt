 Hepatocytes overnight-starved rats incubated 1-20 mM-fructose, -dihydroxyacetone, -glycerol, -alanine -lactate -pyruvate without 0.1 microM-glucagon. production glucose lactate measured, content fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. concentrations fructose (below 5 mM) dihydroxyacetone (above 1 mM) gave rise increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate glucagon effect production glucose lactate could observed. Glycerol effect fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content production lactate, glucagon stimulate production glucose precursor. alanine lactate/pyruvate substrates, glucagon stimulated glucose production whether concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate increased not. extent inactivation pyruvate kinase glucagon affected presence various gluconeogenic precursors. role fructose 2,6-bisphosphate effect glucagon gluconeogenesis precursors entering pathway level triose phosphates pyruvate discussed.
