 Hypoxia-induced changes rat skeletal muscle investigated two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) mass spectrometry. results indicated proteins involved TCA cycle, ATP production, electron transport down-regulated, whereas glycolytic enzymes deaminases involved ATP AMP production up-regulated. Up-regulation hypoxia markers hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) also observed, suggesting vivo adaptation hypoxia requires active metabolic switch. kinase protein, mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), implicated regulation protein synthesis hypoxia, appears unchanged, suggesting activity, system, controlled oxygen partial pressure.
