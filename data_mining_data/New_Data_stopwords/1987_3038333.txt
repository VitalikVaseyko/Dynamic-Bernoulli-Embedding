 effect position number another intracellular location signal activity nuclear location signal investigated. minimal signal inserted several sites within polypeptide chain pyruvate kinase. results observed suggest nuclear location signal function variety positions within protein locations activity masked. Multiple copies partially defective signal integrated pyruvate kinase. data suggest multiple signals cooperate enhance nuclear accumulation. nuclear location signal failed function inserted polyomavirus middle active identical variant lacking carboxy-terminal hydrophobic tail. conclude minimal nuclear location signal sufficient nuclear localization, activity crucially dependent protein context within present.
