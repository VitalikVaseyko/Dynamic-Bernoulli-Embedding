 phosphorylase phosphatases rat rabbit liver cytosol markedly stimulated histone H1, protamine polylysine identified protein phosphatases-2A0, 2A1 2A2 anion-exchange chromatography, gel-filtration immunotitration experiments. Histone H1 protamine also stimulated dephosphorylation phosphorylase kinase, glycogen synthase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase phenylalanine hydroxylase phosphatases-2A1 2A2, several substrates activation even striking (20-100-fold) observed phosphorylase (approximately 5-fold). Activation basic polypeptides involve dissociation phosphatases free catalytic subunit. dephosphorylation phosphorylase protein phosphatase-1 suppressed basic polypeptides, protamine polylysine potent inhibitors. However, dephosphorylation glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase markedly stimulated histone H1 protamine (2-13-fold). Consequently, appropriate substrates, protein phosphatase-1 also regarded basic-polypeptide-activated protein phosphatase. Heparin stimulated (1.5-2-fold) dephosphorylation phosphorylase phosphatases-2A0 2A1, provided Mn2+ present, phosphatase-2A2 free catalytic subunit phosphatase-2A unaffected. Heparin, conjunction Mn2+, also stimulated (1.5-fold) dephosphorylation glycogen synthase (labelled sites 3 abc), phosphorylase kinase phenylalanine hydroxylase phosphatase-2A1, phosphatase-2A2. contrast, dephosphorylation phosphorylase phosphorylase kinase protein phosphatase-1 inhibited heparin. However, dephosphorylation glycogen synthase pyruvate kinase phosphatase-1 stimulated mucopolysaccharide. studies demonstrate basic proteins used distinguish protein phosphatase-1 protein phosphatase-2A, phosphorylase employed substrate. Optimal differentiation two phosphatases observed 30 micrograms/ml protamine heparin concentrations greater 150 microM.
