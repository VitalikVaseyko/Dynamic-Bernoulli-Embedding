 Inflammation energy-intensive process, caloric restriction (CR) could provide anti-inflammatory benefits. CR mimetics (CRM), glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), mimic beneficial effects CR without inducing CR-related physiologic disturbance. study investigated potential anti-inflammatory benefits 2-DG underlying mechanisms mice lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lethal endotoxemia. results indicated pretreatment 2-DG suppressed LPS-induced elevation tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin 6. also suppressed upregulation myeloperoxidase, attenuated Evans blue leakage, alleviated histological abnormalities lung, improved survival LPS-challenged mice. Treatment 2-DG obvious effects total level pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), significantly suppressed LPS-induced elevation PKM2 nuclei. Prevention PKM2 nuclear accumulation ML265 mimicked anti-inflammatory benefits 2-DG. addition, treatment 2-DG ML265 suppressed phosphorylation nuclear signal transducer activator transcription 3 (STAT3). Inhibition STAT3 stattic suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory injury. Interestingly, posttreatment 2-DG early stage post-LPS challenge also improved survival experimental animals. study found treatment 2-DG, representative CRM, provided anti-inflammatory benefits lethal inflammation. underlying mechanisms included suppressed nuclear PKM2-STAT3 pathway. data suggest 2-DG might potential value early intervention lethal inflammation.
