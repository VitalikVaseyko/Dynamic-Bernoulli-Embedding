 investigation occurrence enzymes phosphoglucomutase (PGM), glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT), adenylatkinase (AK), adenosine-desaminase (ADA), 6-phophogluconate-dehydrogenase (6-PGD) produced following results: phosphoglucomutase type demonstrated sperm samples seminal stains accordance corresponding blood type. enzyme rather stable could still demonstrated well 1-month old stains. glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase seldom determined semen seminal stains. found GPT 1 type, known usually strongest activity. adenylatekinase demonstrable fresh ejaculates (not older 24 h) half seminal stains (not older 7 days)--The AK--2-band gets weak increasing lay days, may lead incorrect determinations. adenosine-desaminase could determined sperm. contrary, 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase could demonstrated fresh semen samples also partly seminal stains 7 days. demonstration enzymes depend system secretor type.
