 Acquired resistance cyclin-dependent kinases 4 6 (CDK4/6) small-molecule inhibitors breast cancer arises mechanisms yet uncharacterized. study, used kinome-wide siRNA screen identify kinases that, downregulated, yield sensitivity CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib. manner, identified 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) key modifier ribociclib sensitivity estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition PDK1 GSK2334470 combination ribociclib palbociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, synergistically inhibited proliferation increased apoptosis panel ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. Ribociclib-resistant breast cancer cells selected chronic drug exposure displayed relative increase levels PDK1 activation AKT pathway. Analysis cells revealed CDK4/6 inhibition failed induce cell-cycle arrest senescence. Mechanistic investigations showed resistant cells coordinately upregulated expression cyclins A, E, D1, activated phospho-CDK2, phospho-S477/T479 AKT. Treatment GSK2334470 CDK2 inhibitor dinaciclib sufficient reverse events restore sensitivity ribociclib-resistant cells CDK4/6 inhibitors. Ribociclib, combination GSK2334470 PI3Kalpha inhibitor alpelisib, decreased xenograft tumor growth potently drug alone. Taken together, results highlight role PI3K-PDK1 signaling pathway mediating acquired resistance CDK4/6 inhibitors. Cancer Res; 77(9); 2488-99. (c)2017 AACR.
