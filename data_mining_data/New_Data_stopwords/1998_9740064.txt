 Rapid ventricular pacing dogs results low output cardiomyopathic state similar idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy man. However, pathophysiological mechanisms cause failure following pacing unknown. Five dogs underwent rapid ventricular pacing. Hearts stimulated 245 beats per min (bpm) four weeks reduced 190 bpm stabilize failure. Six unoperated dogs used controls. paper compares two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) protein patterns left ventricular samples paced myocardium control dogs. Changes protein expression analyzed qualitatively semi-quantitatively. paced dog samples 69 protein spots significantly altered 42 decreased 27 elevated. One qualitative change observed: elongation factor Tu present control hearts. proteins, 20 identified combination N-terminal protein microsequencing, peptide mass profiling mass spectrometry, amino acid compositional analysis, comparison databases canine human ventricular proteins. Ten associated mitochondria energy production, including: pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component, isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha, HSP60 HSP70, creatine kinase fatty acid binding protein. cytoskeletal protein desmin detected reduced quantities spot corresponding fragment desmin increased. results indicate development heart failure paced dog involves alterations mitochondrial energy production, cytoskeleton calcium activation.
