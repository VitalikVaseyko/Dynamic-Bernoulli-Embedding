 activity enzymes regulatory function pathways glycolysis, glyconeogenesis NADP-generation, tissue content DNA, protein, glycogen, triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), cholesterol dry matter investigated placentas deliveries accompanied fetal distress result umbilical cord compression placental dysfunction toxemic pregnancies. placentas cases fetal distress due umbilical cord compression, increased activity pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase NADP-malate dehydrogenase, decreased activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. activity aspartate aminotransferase unchanged, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase slightly elevated. tissue content dry matter, DNA, TG PL increased, whereas protein, cholesterol glycogen concentrations remained unaltered. placentas deliveries accompanied fetal distress due placental dysfunction, pyruvate kinase, calculated per mg protein, enzyme decreased activity. TG, PL, glycogen dry matter content increased, DNA concentration decreased, protein cholesterol remained unchanged. suggested divergent placental metabolic patterns found two fetal distress groups related different levels disturbed oxygen passage along uterus-placenta-fetus axis.
