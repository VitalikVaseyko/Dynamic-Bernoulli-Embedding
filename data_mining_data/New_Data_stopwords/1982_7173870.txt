 erythrocytic liver pyruvate kinases (PK) patient congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia studied. red blood cells, residual activity, 28% normal control, presented normal kinetic properties, instability heat urea, slow electrophoretic mobility. L-type PK patient's liver characterized normal activity, kinetic properties, stability heat urea, electrophoretic mobility. fact erythrocyte mutant PK may, previous reports, may associated, present observation, molecular abnormalities liver PK provides support hypothesis gene rearrangement compatible two different tissue-specific mRNAs.
