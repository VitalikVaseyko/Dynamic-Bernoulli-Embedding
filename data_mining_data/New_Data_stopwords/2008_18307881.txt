 OBJECTIVE: characterize biologic featrues hepatic oval cells protein expression profiles induced differentiation vitro. METHODS: Rat hepatic oval cells treated epidermal growth factor (EGF) hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) vitro, followed morphological molecular marker assessment electromicroscopy, immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR protein expression chip technology. RESULTS: Ten weeks induction, levels GST-P mRNA M2-PK mRNA significantly reduced, whereas ALB CK18 elevated. Significant variations expression seen 8 protein species course induced differentiation. CONCLUSION: Combined EGF HGF treatment vitro induces cell differentiation hepatic oval cells, process 8 protein species may play regulatory roles.
