 research metabolic effects high fructose diet, studied duration effects measuring specific activity 8 enzymes stimulated diet, days, 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, return normal diet. intestinal mucosa, ketohexokinase, aldolase, triokinase, fructose-diphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase specific activities still entirely partially stimulated 15th day return standard diet. stimulation glucose-6-phosphatase pyruvate kinase specific activities stopped quickly. liver, exception fructose-diphosphatase, return basic values much quicker intestine. 7 enzymes 8 realized 9 days less. high fructose diet gives way normal one, return basic values comes much quicker activation needed longer appear.
