 MicroRNAs play important role tumor development progression. Tumor growth closely associated glucose metabolism. Specifically, tumor cells produce energy (ATP) aerobic anaerobic conditions glycolysis metabolites, lactic acid ATP, result Warburg effect. However, transport glucose cells depends protein transporters cell membrane. Therefore, area recently become topic interest research targeted cancer therapy. found miRNA-451 inhibits phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway modify biological behavior glioma cells. Inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway may prevent glucose-addicted cancer cells performing glycolysis. Akt directly affects glycolysis regulating localization glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). However, miRNA-451 regulates glucose transporters cell membrane affects regulatory mechanisms glucose metabolism glioma cells remains unclear. Consequently, predict verify related gene protein interactions. targeting CAB 39, miRNA-451 likely triggers LKB1/AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway, regulates GLUT1, inhibit glucose metabolism of, reduce energy supply to, inhibit proliferation invasion glioma cells. results suggest new direction treatment glioma.
