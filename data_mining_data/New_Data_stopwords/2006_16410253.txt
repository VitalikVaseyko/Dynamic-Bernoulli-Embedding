 Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) predominant energy substrate utilized adult heart. heart utilize unesterified FA bound albumin FA obtained lipolysis lipoprotein-bound triglyceride (TG). used heart-specific lipoprotein lipase knock-out mice (hLpL0) test whether two sources FA interchangeable necessary optimal heart function. Hearts unable obtain FA lipoprotein TG able compensate increasing glucose uptake, glycolysis, glucose oxidation. HLpL0 hearts decreased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 increased cardiomyocyte expression glucose transporter 4. Conversely, FA oxidation rates reduced isolated perfused hLpL0 hearts. Following abdominal aortic constriction expression levels genes regulating FA glucose metabolism acutely up-regulated control hLpL0 mice, yet hLpL0 mice died within 48 h abdominal aortic constriction. Older hLpL0 mice developed cardiac dysfunction characterized decreased fractional shortening interstitial perivascular fibrosis. HLpL0 hearts increased expression several genes associated transforming growth factor-beta signaling. Thus, long term reduction lipoprotein FA uptake associated impaired cardiac function despite compensatory increase glucose utilization.
