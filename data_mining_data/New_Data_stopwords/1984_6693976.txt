 Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples obtained biopsy technique slaughter steers fed either corn concentrate pelleted alfalfa (roughage) diet. Steers fed roughage diet slightly greater metabolizable energy intakes concentrate-fed steers due greater rates feed intake; however, steers fed concentrate diet faster rates gain, primarily fat depots. Diet effect incorporation 14C-labeled acetate lactate fatty acids, although 3H2O incorporation fatty acids greater concentrate-fed steers. Although backfat thickness 60% greater concentrate-fed steers, number adipocytes per gram adipose tissue unaffected diet, suggesting adipose cell hyperplasia. activities acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, ATP citrate lyase, NADP+ malate dehydrogenase, hexokinase greater steers fed concentrate diet; pyruvate kinase activity unaffected diet. Fatty acid synthesis several lipogenic enzyme activities increased age declined markedly time terminal biopsy. Basal net rates lipolysis generally unaffected diet increased age animal. animals gained weight, ratio net fatty acids released glycerol released decreased, suggesting extensive reesterification fatty acids released lipolysis.
