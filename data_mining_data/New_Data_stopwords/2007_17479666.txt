 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK instrumental tumour metabolism hence over-expressed tumour cells leading detectable plasma concentrations. OBJECTIVES: assess degree association M2-PK plasma concentrations ovarian cancer determine cut-off values sensitivity specificity differentiating benign malignant ovarian disease. SETTINGS: Gynaecological Cancer Centre King's College St. Thomas' Hospitals, London, UK. METHODS: Patients suspected ovarian cancer referred centre recruited prospectively years 2004-2005. Blood samples collected surgery plasma M2-PK assays. Results assessed respect cancer diagnosis, patient tumour characteristics. Statistical analysis including receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve performed using Analyse-It SPSS V 13. RESULTS: 100 patients age range 14-88 years median 57 years recruited study. 52 diagnosed invasive ovarian cancer. 35 (67%) Stage III two secondary tumours. M2-PK related patient age (p = 0.43). significant correlation CA125 M2-PK (p < 0.001). mean M2-PK concentration cancer patients 52 U/ml versus 27 U/ml patients benign conditions (p < 0.001). cut-off value 22 U/ml sensitivity M2-PK detecting cancer 70% specificity 65%. CONCLUSION: M2-PK significantly raised ovarian cancer patients, however role clinical practice needs evaluation.
