 inhibition photosynthetic CO(2) fixation O(2), commonly referred Warburg effect, examined isolated intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts. major characteristics effect isolated chloroplasts rapid reversibility O(2) replaced N(2), increased inhibition O(2) low concentrations CO(2) decreased effect O(2) increased concentrations CO(2).Both DPN- TPN-linked glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases aldolase inhibited O(2). photoreduction TPN measured fragmented chloroplast preparations similar N(2) O(2) concentration 5 micromolar TPN. effect 100% O(2) (14)CO(2) assimilation overcome completely fructose 1,6-diphosphate ribose 5-phosphate ascorbate, cysteine, dithiothreitol reduced lipoate. Glycolate became major photosynthetic product high partial pressures O(2) low CO(2) concentrations. concluded O(2) depresses photosynthesis primarily causing shift major portion total carbon glycolate impairing functioning photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle. mechanism whereby O(2) alters flow carbon glycolate remains unknown.
