 BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) sixth leading cause cancer death responsible 11,000 deaths per year US. Approximately one-third patients present disease already metastatic currently adequate treatment, biofluid screening tests exist RCC. study, undertaken comprehensive proteomic analysis subsequently pathway network approach identify biological processes involved clear cell RCC (ccRCC). used data investigate urinary markers RCC could applied high-risk patients, followed recurrence, early diagnosis treatment, thereby substantially reducing mortality disease. RESULTS: Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis mass spectrometric analysis, identified 31 proteins differentially expressed high degree significance ccRCC compared adjacent non-malignant tissue, confirmed immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, comparison published transcriptomic data. evaluated several pathway biological process analysis programs, proteins demonstrated involved high degree confidence (p values < 2.0 E-05) glycolysis, propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, urea cycle arginine/proline metabolism, well non-metabolic p53 FAS pathways. pilot study using random urine samples ccRCC control patients, performed metabolic profiling found sorbitol, component alternative glycolysis pathway, significantly elevated 5.4-fold RCC patients compared controls. CONCLUSION: Extensive pathway network analysis allowed discovery highly significant pathways set clear cell RCC samples. Knowledge activation processes lead novel assays identifying proteomic and/or metabolomic signatures biofluids patient high risk disease; provide pilot data urinary bioassay. Furthermore, demonstrate knowledge networks, processes, pathways altered kidney cancer may used influence choice optimal therapy.
