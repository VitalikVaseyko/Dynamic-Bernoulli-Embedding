 contrast normal differentiated cells depend aerobicoxidation energy production, cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis main source (Warburg's effect). M2 splice isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) key regulator aerobic glycolysis, high expression PKM2 contributes aerobic glycolysis, promotes growth tumors. present study, found PKM2 highly expressed gastric cancer (GC) tissues strongly inverse correlation expression microRNA-let-7a (miR-let-7a). Furthermore, found overexpression miR-let-7a markedly suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion GC cells down-regulating expression PKM2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) important regulators play key roles tumorigenesis tumor progression. Although previous reports showed let-7 family members act tumor suppressors many cancers. specific regulatory mechanism miR-let-7a PKM2 gastric cancer still unclear. study, revealed miR-let-7a function antitumor gene regulatory effects PKM2 GC cells.
