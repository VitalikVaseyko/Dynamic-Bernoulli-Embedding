 present study investigated inhibitory effects rice hull smoke extract (RHSE) adipogenesis 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells mice fed high fat (HFD) normal (ND) diets. concentrations 0.1% 0.5%, RHSE shown reduce cellular lipid content MDI-induced 3T3-L1 cells 72% 88%, respectively, compared control cells without RHSE, indicating strong antiadipogenic effect. result supported finding expression adipocyte differentiation marker adiponectin suppressed. MTT lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays showed RHSE doses 0.5% (v/v) cytotoxic 3T3-L1 cells. RHSE activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) raising phosphorylated ratio early phase cell differentiation, western blot analysis showed dose-dependently inhibited expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) late stage differentiation. antiadipogenic properties RHSE confirmed vivo using experimental obese mice high-fat diet. Dietary supplementations 0.5% 1% RHSE resulted reduction end 7-week feeding study body weight gain 66.9% 72.5%, respectively, reduction epididymal white adipose tissue weight 87.9%, restoration elevated total cholesterol triglyceride levels plasma liver observed ND-fed mice, normalization distorted serum leptin adiponectin levels, restoration liver weight glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase/glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GOT/GPT) enzymes, blood urea, serum creatinine normal control levels observed ND-fed mice. found 3T3-L1 cells, RHSE up-regulated AMPK phosphorylation down-regulated PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha SREBP-1c protein expression epididymal white adipose tissues. results indicate RHSE inhibits AMPK signaling pathway mice might serve antiobesity multifunctional food additive.
