 Halogenated acetic acids (HAAs) produced chlorine disinfection municipal drinking water represent potentially important class environmental contaminants. Little known, however, potential adversely impact fish aquatic life. study examined kinetics effects dichloroacetic acid (DCA) rainbow trout. Branchial uptake measured fish confined respirometer-metabolism chambers. Branchial uptake efficiency <5%, suggesting passive diffusion aqueous channels gill epithelium. DCA concentrations tissues following prolonged (72, 168, 336 h) waterborne exposures expressed tissue:plasma concentration ratios. Concentration ratios kidney muscle 168 336 h consistent suggestion DCA distributes primarily tissue water. Reduced concentration ratios liver, particularly 72 h, indicated DCA highly metabolized tissue. Routes rates elimination characterized injecting chambered animals high (5.0mg/kg) low (50 microg/kg) bolus dose. DCA rapidly cleared naive animals resulting elimination half-lives (t(1/2)) less 4h. Waterborne pre-treatment fish DCA increased persistence subsequently injected dose. high dose animals, pre-treatment caused 4-fold decrease whole-body clearance (CL(B)) corresponding increases area plasma concentration-time curve (extrapolated infinity; AUC(0-->infinity)) t(1/2). Qualitatively similar results obtained low dose fish, although magnitude pre-treatment effect ( approximately 2.5-fold) reduced. Renal branchial clearance contributed little (combined, <3% CL(B)) elimination DCA. Biliary elimination DCA also negligible. steady-state volume distribution (V(SS)) vary among treatment groups consistent results tissue distribution study. DCA apparent effects respiratory physiology acid-base balance; however, concentration blood lactate declined progressively continuous waterborne exposures. transient effect blood lactate also observed bolus injection experiments. results study suggest clearance DCA due almost entirely metabolism. pathway responsible activity exhibits characteristics common mammalian glutathione S-transferase zeta (GSTzeta), including non-linear kinetics apparent suicide inactivation DCA. Observed effects blood lactate probably due inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase aerobic tissues may require participation monocarboxylase transport protein move DCA across cell membranes.
