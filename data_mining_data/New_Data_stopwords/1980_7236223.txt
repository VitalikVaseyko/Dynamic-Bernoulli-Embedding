 Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis immunoprecipitates liver cytosol anti-(L-type pyruvate kinase) serum revealed proteins mol.wt. 56 000 42 000 addition heavy light chains. ratio 56 000 mol.wt. 42 000 mol.wt. protein increased dietary conditions resulted increase apparent specific activity hepatic pyruvate kinase. 42 000 mol.wt. protein removed immunoprecipitates liver cytosol partially purified pH precipitation (NH4)2SO4 fractionation addition antiserum. technique may used analyse formation pure L-type pyruvate kinase liver. using H14CO3-labelling, t1/2 L-type pyruvate kinase estimated 75 +/- 1.7 h post-weaned high-carbohydrate-diet-fed rats. weaning little immunoreactive pyruvate kinase rat liver cytosol. Induction began 6 24 h weaning reached maximum value 120 h weaning. clearly enhanced total pyruvate kinase activity first observed 24 h post-weaning, apparent specific activity hepatic pyruvate kinase considerably lower specific activity pure isolated enzyme. induction L-type pyruvate kinase monitored incorporation L-[4,5-3H]leucine, maximum rate synthesis occurred 24--48 h weaning. period synthesis declined, indicating relatively slow turnover enzyme enzyme concentration established liver.
