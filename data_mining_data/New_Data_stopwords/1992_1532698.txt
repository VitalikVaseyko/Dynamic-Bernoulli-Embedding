 association glycolytic enzymes particulate fraction cell assessed brain freshwater turtle, Pseudemys scripta elegans, using three different methodologies. method showed large percentage eight enzymes bound brain. effect environmental anoxia (5 20 h submergence N2-bubbled water 7 degrees C) distribution enzymes free bound states analyzed. three techniques showed significant increase percentages brain aldolase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase bound anoxia change lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase binding. Two methodologies also showed increase percent bound anoxia hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase. increased association glycolytic enzymes structural elements cell anoxia may physically position glycolytic pathway facilitate coupling ATP-generating pathway ATP-utilizing processes, membrane ion pumps.
