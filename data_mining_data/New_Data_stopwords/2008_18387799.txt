 Tumor cells display increased metabolic autonomy comparison non-transformed cells, taking nutrients metabolizing pathways support growth proliferation. Classical work tumor cell metabolism focused bioenergetics, particularly enhanced glycolysis suppressed oxidative phosphorylation (the 'Warburg effect'). biosynthetic activities required create daughter cells equally important tumor growth, recent studies bringing pathways focus. review, discuss tumor cells achieve high rates nucleotide fatty acid synthesis, oncogenes tumor suppressors influence activities, glutamine metabolism enables macromolecular synthesis proliferating cells.
