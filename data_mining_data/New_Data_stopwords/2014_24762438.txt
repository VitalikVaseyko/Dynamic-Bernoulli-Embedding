 Warburg effect tumorigenic metabolic adaptation process characterized augmented aerobic glycolysis, enhances cellular bioenergetics. normal cells, energy homeostasis controlled AMPK; however, role cancer understood, AMPK-dependent tumor-promoting -inhibiting functions reported. Upon stress, energy levels maintained increased mitochondrial biogenesis glycolysis, controlled transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha HIF, respectively. normoxia, AMPK induces PGC-1alpha, HIF activated unclear. Germline mutations gene encoding tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) lead Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, associated increased cancer risk. FLCN identified AMPK binding partner, evaluated role respect AMPK-dependent energy functions. revealed loss FLCN constitutively activates AMPK, resulting PGC-1alpha-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis increased ROS production. ROS induced HIF transcriptional activity drove Warburg metabolic reprogramming, coupling AMPK-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis HIF-dependent metabolic changes. reprogramming stimulated cellular bioenergetics conferred HIF-dependent tumorigenic advantage FLCN-negative cancer cells. Moreover, pathway conserved BHD-derived tumor. results indicate FLCN inhibits tumorigenesis preventing AMPK-dependent HIF activation subsequent Warburg metabolic transformation.
