 Various attempts made enhance lysine production Corynebacterium glutamicum. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) defect one strategies used enhance supply oxaloacetic acid (OAA), precursor metabolite lysine biosynthesis. However, inconsistent effects mutation reported: positive effects PYK defect mutants phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) desensitized feedback inhibition aspartic acid, negative effects simple PYK gene (pyk) knockout mutants. address discrepancies, effects pyk deletion lysine yield investigated without D299N mutation ppc rendering PEPC desensitization. C. glutamicum ATCC13032 mutant strain P feedback inhibition-desensitized aspartokinase used parent strain, producing 9.36 g/L lysine 100 g/L glucose jar fermentor culture. conditions, simple mutant D2 pyk deletion R2 PEPC-desensitization mutation showed marginally increased lysine yield ( approximately 1.1-fold, significant), mutant DR2 strain mutations showed synergistically increased lysine productivity (1.38-fold, 12.9 g/L). Therefore, pyk deletion effective PEPC-desensitized background, ensures enhanced supply OAA, thus clarifying discrepancies. citrate synthase defective mutation (S252C gltA) increased lysine yield strain DR2 (1.68-fold, 15.7 g/L). Thus, three mutations coordinately enhanced lysine yield. malate:quinone oxidoreductase activity respiration rate significantly reduced strains D2 DR2. Overall, results provide valuable knowledge engineering anaplerotic reaction increase lysine yield C. glutamicum.
