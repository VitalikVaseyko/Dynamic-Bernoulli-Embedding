 Glycolytic enzymes (GEs) shown exist multienzyme complexes inner surface human erythrocyte membrane. protein band 3 found interact GEs, several GEs bind band 3, decided identify additional membrane proteins serve docking sites GE membrane. purpose, method known "label transfer" employs photoactivatable trifunctional cross-linking reagent deliver biotin derivatized GE binding partner membrane used. Mass spectrometry analysis membrane proteins biotinylated following rebinding photoactivation labeled GAPDH, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase revealed anticipated binding partner, band 3, also association GEs specific peptides alpha- beta-spectrin, ankyrin, actin, p55, protein 4.2. importantly, labeled GEs also found transfer biotin GEs complex, demonstrating first time GEs also associate membrane complexes. Surprisingly, new GE binding site repeatedly identified near junction membrane-spanning cytoplasmic domains band 3, binding site confirmed direct binding studies. results identify new components membrane-associated GE complexes also provide molecular details specific peptides form interfacial contacts within interaction.
