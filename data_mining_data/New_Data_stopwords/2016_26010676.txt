 environmental endocrine disrupter bisphenol (BPA) ubiquitous environment, potential toxic effects plants. Previous studies found significant effect BPA levels mineral nutrients plant roots, underlying mechanism remains unknown. determine BPA influences root mineral nutrients, effects BPA (1.5 mg L(-1) , 3.0 mg L(-1) , 6.0 mg L(-1) , 12.0 mg L(-1) , 24.0 mg L(-1) , 48.0 mg L(-1) , 96.0 mg L(-1) ) activities critical respiratory enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase) investigated soybean seedling roots. BPA exposure 7 d, low concentrations BPA increased activities critical respiratory enzymes roots, whereas opposite effects observed roots exposed high concentrations BPA, inhibitory effect greater higher BPA concentrations. addition, evident morphological anomalies decreases root lengths volumes induced high concentrations BPA. Following withdrawal BPA exposure 7 d, activities respiratory enzymes visible signs toxicity recovered, extent recovery depended type enzyme BPA concentration. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed disturbance BPA activities respiratory enzymes, led interference energy metabolism roots, might effect mechanism BPA mineral element accumulation plant roots.
