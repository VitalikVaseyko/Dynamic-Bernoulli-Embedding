 effects imidazoline compound (BL11282) protein expression rat pancreatic islets investigated proteomic approach. compound increases insulin release selectively high glucose concentrations therefore interest type 2 diabetes. Whole cell extracts isolated drug-treated native pancreatic rat islets compared separation 2-D gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins identified mass spectrometry; 15 proteins selectively up-regulated 7 selectively down-regulated drug-treated islets. special interest among differentially expressed proteins involved protein folding (Hsp60, protein disulfide isomerase, calreticulin), Ca(2+) binding (calgizzarin, calcyclin annexin I) metabolism signalling (pyruvate kinase, alpha enolase protein kinase C inhibitor 1).
