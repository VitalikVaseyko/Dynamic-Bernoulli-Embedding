 OBJECTIVE: identify interacting proteins S100A8 S100A9 HEK293 cell line flag-tag affinity purification liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods: p3xFlag-CMV-S100A8 p3xFlag-CMV-S100A9 expression vectors constructed inserting S100A8 S100A9 coding sequence. recombinant plasmids transfected HEK293 cells. Affinity purification LC-MS/MS applied identify proteins interacting S100A8 S100A9. Bioinformatics analysis used seek gene ontology interacting proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) applied confirm proteins interacted S100A8 S100A9. Results: Fourteen proteins including pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), nucleophosmin (NPM1) eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), potentially interacted S100A8, successfully identified Flag-tag affinity purification followed LC-MS/MS analysis. Six proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (14-3-3epsilon) PKM, potentially interacted S100A9, successfully identified. Gene ontology analysis identified proteins suggested proteins interacted S100A8 S100A9 involved several biological pathways, including canonical glycolysis, positive regulation NF-kappaB transcription factor activity, negative regulation apoptotic process, cell-cell adhesion, etc. Co-IP experiment confirmed PKM2 interact S100A8 S100A9, 14-3-3epsilon interact S100A8. Conclusion: PKM2 identified interact S100A8 S100A9, 14-3-3epsilon interact S100A9. results may provide new clue role S100A8 S100A9 progression colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
