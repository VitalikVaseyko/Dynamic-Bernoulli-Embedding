 New Zealand obese (NZO) mice exhibit severe insulin resistance hepatic glucose metabolism. order define biochemical basis, studied differential expression genes involved hepatic glucose lipid metabolism microarray analysis. NZOxF1 (SJLxNZO) backcross mice generated order obtain populations heterogeneous metabolism comparable genetic background. backcross mice, groups controls (normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic), insulin-resistant (normoglycemic/hyperinsulinemic) diabetic (hyperglycemic/hypoinsulinemic) mice identified. 22 weeks, mRNA isolated liver, converted cDNA, used screening two types cDNA arrays (high-density filter arrays Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays). Differential gene expression ascertained assessed Northern blotting. data indicate hyperinsulinemia NZO mouse associated with: (i) increased mRNA levels enzymes involved lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase) fatty acid oxidation (cytochrome P450 4A14, ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, acyl-CoA oxidase), (ii) induction key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, (iii) increased mRNA levels gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. effects enhanced high-fat diet. conclusion, pattern gene expression insulin-resistant NZO mice appears reflect dissociation effects insulin genes involved glucose lipid metabolism. data consistent hypothetical scenario insulin-resistant hepatic glucose production produces hyperinsulinemia, enhanced insulin- substrate-driven lipogenesis aggravates deleterious insulin resistance glucose metabolism.
