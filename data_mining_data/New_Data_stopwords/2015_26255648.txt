 Tumour cells, stromal cells stroma comprise tumour microenvironment. metabolism tumour cells several types tumour stromal cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts tumour-associated macrophages, reprogrammed. Current studies found stromal cells promote tumour progression metastasis, paracrine secretion cytokines chemokines, also intermediate metabolites. Here, summarize latest insights mechanism metabolic reprogramming cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts tumour-associated macrophages, potential roles tumour progression metastasis.
