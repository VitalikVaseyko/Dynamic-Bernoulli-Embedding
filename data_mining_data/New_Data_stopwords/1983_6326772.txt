 kinetic structural properties purified, homogeneous pyruvate kinase type M2 chicken lung tumors, including Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken fibroblasts, compared. "tumor enzyme" characterized low affinity phosphoenolpyruvate, pronounced serine activation, strong alanine inhibition compared "lung type". contrast rat lung enzyme, affected serine, chicken lung enzyme slightly activated serine. serine metabolites phosphoserine glycine activate "tumor type M2 pyruvate kinase", L-alpha-glycerophosphorylcholine phosphatidylserine slightly activate physiological concentrations. Studies substances structurally related serine reveal hydroxyl group serine prerequisite activation amino carboxyl groups determine affinity "tumor type M2 pyruvate kinase" serine. Two different fragmentation methods (CNBr-cleavage V-8 proteolysis) two different methods separation resulting peptide fragments (polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focussing SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis) indicated high degree homology type M2 pyruvate kinases lung tumors well type M1 muscle. type pyruvate kinase, however, contains one two unique protein fragments characteristic type. termed fragments L (lung), (muscle), (tumor).
