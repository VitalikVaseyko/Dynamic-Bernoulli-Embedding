 Metabolic engineering achieved encouraging success producing foreign metabolites variety hosts. However, common strategies engineering metabolic pathways focus amplifying desired enzymes deregulating cellular controls. result, uncontrolled deregulated metabolic pathways lead metabolic imbalance suboptimal productivity. demonstrated second stage metabolic engineering effort designing engineering regulatory circuit control gene expression response intracellular metabolic states. Specifically, recruited altered one global regulatory systems Escherichia coli, Ntr regulon, control engineered lycopene biosynthesis pathway. artificially engineered regulon, stimulated excess glycolytic flux sensing intracellular metabolite, acetyl phosphate, controls expression two key enzymes lycopene synthesis response flux dynamics. intracellular control loop significantly enhanced lycopene production reducing negative impact caused metabolic imbalance. Although demonstrated strategy metabolite production, extended fields gene expression must closely controlled intracellular physiology, gene therapy.
