 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation migration RPE cells characterize development proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) fibro-proliferative eye diseases leading blindness. common event pathologies alteration BRB allows interaction RPE cells thrombin, pro-inflammatory protease contained serum. Thrombin promotion cytoskeletal reorganization, proliferation, migration reported different cell types, although molecular mechanisms involved processes remain poorly understood. previous work demonstrated thrombin promotes RPE cell proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling migration, hallmark processes development PVR. Thrombin induction RPE cell proliferation requires PI3K, PDK1, Akt/PKB (Akt) signaling leading cyclin D1 gene expression. Since Akt functions upstream activator mechanistic target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) also downstream target mTORC2, aim work determine whether mTOR involved thrombin-induced RPE cell proliferation regulating cyclin D1 expression immortalized rat RPE-J cell line. Results demonstrate thrombin-induced cyclin D1 expression cell proliferation require Akt-independent phosphorylation/activation mTOR Ser 2448 mediated PI3K/PKC-zeta/ERK1/2 signaling, concomitant Akt-dependent activation p70S6K carried mTORC1.
