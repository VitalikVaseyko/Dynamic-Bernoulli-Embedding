 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) one common tumors worldwide, high malignant degree poor prognosis. present study aims investigate relationship pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression prognosis patients ESCC. expression PKM2 86 cases esophageal carcinoma tissues tested using immunohistochemistry. relationship PKM2 expression clinical pathological parameters, effects prognosis patients ESCC analyzed. expression levels PKM2 cytoplasm nucleus ESCC tissues significantly higher paracancerous tissues (P=6.73x10(-9) 4.32x10(-6), respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed nuclear PKM2 expression closely related survival patients ESCC (P=0.005). Patients high PKM2 expression nucleus significantly shorter survival times low PKM2 expression nucleus (hazard ratio death, 2.358; 95% confidence interval, 1.156-4.812; P=0.018). significant difference found PMK2 expression clinico-pathological features ESCC patients (all P>0.05). conclusion, high PKM2 expression nucleus essential pathogenic process ESCC may used predict prognosis patients ESCC.
