 PURPOSE: Retinal injuries affect photoreceptors and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may result leakage retinal proteins systemic circulation. study designed determine whether immune response elicited acute retinal injury resulting circulating anti-retinal antibodies serum. METHODS: Fifty laser burns different grades (minimally visible lesion [MVL], grade II [GII], grade III [GIII] lesions) created retinas Dutch Belted rabbits. degree laser burns confirmed fundus imaging histology. Serum samples collected animals 3 months retinal injury. Candidate autoantigens identified two-dimensional (2-D) Western blots rabbit retinal lysate probed sera either control laser-treated animals. Candidate autoantigens characterized immunostaining confirm retinal localization. RESULTS: Seven 11 protein spots selected MVL GII laser-treated samples, respectively, autoantigen identification. protein spots detected GIII laser-treated samples. Four candidate autoantigens common MVL GII lesions: dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C, chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide 1 subunit zeta, pyruvate kinase isozyme. CONCLUSIONS: Laser-induced retinal injuries resulted circulating anti-retinal antibodies detectable 3 months injury. response appeared vary severity laser retinal damage. identification candidate antigens study suggest approach may permit future development new diagnostic methods retinal injuries.
