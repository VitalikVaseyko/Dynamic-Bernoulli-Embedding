 bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) consists two general energy-coupling proteins [enzyme histidine phosphocarrier protein (HPr)] several sugar-specific enzyme IIs. Although, addition phosphorylation-coupled transport sugars, various regulatory roles PTS components identified Escherichia coli, much less known PTS opportunistic human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus. study, identified pyruvate kinase (PykA) binding partner HPr V. vulnificus. interaction HPr PykA strictly dependent presence inorganic phosphate, dephosphorylated HPr interacted PykA. Experiments involving domain swapping PykAs V. vulnificus E. coli revealed requirement C-terminal domain V. vulnificus PykA specific interaction V. vulnificus HPr. Dephosphorylated HPr decreased Km PykA phosphoenolpyruvate approximately fourfold without affecting Vmax . Taken together, findings indicate V. vulnificus PTS catalyzing first step glycolysis stimulates final step glycolysis presence glucose direct interaction dephospho-HPr C-terminal domain PykA.
