 Lung cancer leading cause cancer death worldwide. Recent data suggest cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) relevant various cancer pathologies. Pathophysiological role phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) possible therapeutic prospects lung cancer investigated. exposed 10 different lung cancer cell lines (adenocarcinoma, squamous large cell carcinoma) hypoxia assessed expression activity PDE4 real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, western blotting PDE activity assays. Expression activity distinct PDE4 isoforms (PDE4A PDE4D) increased response hypoxia eight studied cell lines. Furthermore, analyzed various silico predicted hypoxia-responsive elements (p-HREs) found PDE4A PDE4D genes. Performing mutation analysis p-HRE luciferase reporter constructs, identified four functional HRE sites PDE4A gene two functional HRE sites PDE4D gene mediated hypoxic induction reporter. Silencing hypoxia-inducible factor subunits (HIF1alpha HIF2alpha) small interfering RNA reduced hypoxic induction PDE4A PDE4D. Vice versa, using PDE4 inhibitor (PDE4i) cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -elevating agent, cAMP analogs protein kinase (PKA)-modulating drugs exchange protein directly activated cAMP (EPAC) activator, demonstrated PDE4-cAMP-PKA/EPAC axis enhanced HIF signaling measured HRE reporter gene assay, HIF HIF target genes expression ((lactate dehydrogenase A), LDHA, (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1) PDK1 (vascular endothelial growth factor A) VEGFA). Notably, inhibition PDE4 PDE4i silencing PDE4A PDE4D reduced human lung tumor cell proliferation colony formation. hand, overexpression PDE4A PDE4D increased human lung cancer proliferation. Moreover, PDE4i treatment reduced hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion human cells. vivo, PDE4i inhibited tumor xenograft growth nude mice attenuating proliferation angiogenesis. findings suggest PDE4 expressed lung cancer, crosstalks HIF signaling promotes lung cancer progression. Thus, PDE4 may represent therapeutic target lung cancer therapy.
