 general agreement cancer cells switch aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) upregulate antioxidant enzymes prevent oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Thus, evolving view target metabolic alterations novel anticancer agents restrict tumor progression vivo. Previously reported non toxic dose (10 mg/kg bw i.p.) novel anticancer ruthenium(II)-complex containing 4-carboxy N-ethylbenzamide; Ru(II)-CNEB, administered Dalton's lymphoma (DL) bearing mice, regressed DL growth inducing apoptosis DL cells. also inactivated M4-LDH (M4-lactate dehydrogenase), enzyme drives anaerobic glycolysis tumor cells. present study investigated whether compound able modulate regulation glycolytic inhibition-apoptosis pathway DL cells vivo. observed Ru(II)-CNEB could decline expression inducible form 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (iPFK2: PFKFB3), master regulator glycolysis DL cells. complex also activated superoxide dismutase (the H2O2 producing enzyme) declined levels catalase glutathione peroxidase (the two H2O2 degrading enzymes) impose oxidative stress DL cells. consistent enhanced p53 level, decline Bcl2/Bax ratio activation caspase 9 DL cells. findings suggest Ru(II)-CNEB able activate oxidative stress-apoptosis pathway via p53 (a tumor supressor protein) mediated repression iPFK2, key glycolytic regulator, DL cells vivo.
