 Muscle glucose uptake greatly stimulated moderate exercise, full oxidation glucose CO2 depends activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. aim determine PDH complex different muscle groups responds varying periods moderate exercise. Rats run motor-driven treadmill 5-30 min muscle PDH complex activity determined heart, diaphragm red quadriceps muscles isolation mitochondria presence inhibitors PDH complex interconversion. heart diaphragm muscle, exercise caused increase PDH complex activity 5 min, followed significant decrease activity exercise progressed. red quadriceps muscle, PDH complex activity reduced 5 min exercise decreased exercise continued. conclude increased duration exercise lead reduced PDH complex activity rat muscles. propose consequence elevated fatty acid oxidation, products stimulate PDH kinase. implies increased glycolysis lactate increased fatty acid oxidation simultaneously provide energy contracting muscle.
