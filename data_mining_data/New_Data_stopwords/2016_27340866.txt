 Pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2) exhibits post-translational modifications response various signals tumor microenvironment. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) crucial signal tumor microenvironment promotes cell growth survival many human cancers. Herein, report AKT directly interacts PKM2 phosphorylates Ser-202, essential nuclear translocation PKM2 protein stimulation IGF-1. nucleus, PKM2 binds STAT5A induces IGF-1-stimulated cyclin D1 expression, suggesting PKM2 acts important factor inducing STAT5A activation IGF-1 signaling. Concordantly, overexpression STAT5A cells deficient PKM2 expression failed restore IGF-induced growth, whereas reconstitution PKM2 PKM2 knockdown cells restored IGF-induced growth capacity. findings suggest novel role PKM2 promoting growth cancers dysregulated IGF/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling.
