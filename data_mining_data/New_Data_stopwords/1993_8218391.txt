 methodology kinetic study self-inactivation unstable enzyme developed using transient-phase approach enzymatic activity measured coupled enzyme system. experimental design developed applied inactivation Ca(2+)-ATPase sarcoplasmic reticulum solubilized monomeric state. catalytic activity ATP hydrolysis determined presence pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase auxiliary enzymes, oxidation last substrate, NADH, continuously monitored. experimental results show substrates, ATP calcium, protect enzyme inactivation. enzyme, monomeric ATPase, fulfills catalytic cycle native ATPase, free enzyme first-calcium bound enzyme proposed intermediates inactivated.
