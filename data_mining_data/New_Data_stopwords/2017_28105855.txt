 Influenza virus undergoes frequent changes antigenicity contributes seasonal epidemics unpredictable pandemics. Nucleoprotein, encoded gene segment 5, internal protein virus conserved among strains different host origins. current study, analyzed differentially expressed proteins A549 cells transiently transfected recombinant nucleoprotein influenza virus 2D gel electrophoresis. resolved protein spots gel identified MALDI-TOF/Mass spectrometry analysis. majority host proteins detected differentially abundant recombinant nucleoprotein-expressing cells compared vector-transfected cells proteins metabolic pathways, glycolytic enzymes, molecular chaperones cytoskeletal proteins. demonstrated interaction virus nucleoprotein identified host cellular proteins. vitro binding assay carried using purified recombinant nucleoprotein (pET29a+NP-His) A549 cell lysate confirmed interaction nucleoprotein host proteins, alpha enolase 1, pyruvate kinase beta-actin. preliminary data study provides information virus nucleoprotein interaction proteins involved glycolysis. However, studies ongoing understand significance interactions modulating host factors virus replication.
