 Necroptosis represents key programmed cell death pathway involved various physiological pathophysiological conditions. However, role reactive oxygen species (ROS) necroptotic signaling remained unclear. present study, identify ROS critical regulators BV6/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced necroptotic signaling cell death. show BV6/TNFalpha-induced cell death depends ROS production, several ROS scavengers butylated hydroxyanisole, N-acetylcysteine, alpha-tocopherol ethyl pyruvate significantly rescue cell death. cell death, BV6/TNFalpha-stimulated ROS generation promotes stabilization receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)/RIP3 necrosome complex via potential positive feedback loop, one hand radical scavengers attenuate RIP1/RIP3 necrosome assembly phosphorylation mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL), hand silencing RIP1 RIP3 reduces ROS production. Although MLKL knockdown effectively decreases BV6/TNFalpha-induced cell death, affect RIP1/RIP3 interaction partly reduces ROS generation. Moreover, deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) promotes BV6/TNFalpha-induced ROS generation necrosome assembly even presence BV6, CYLD silencing attenuates events. Genetic silencing phosphoglycerate mutase 5 dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) fails protect BV6/TNFalpha-induced cell death. demonstrating ROS involved regulating BV6/TNFalpha-induced necroptotic signaling, study provides new insights redox regulation necroptosis.
