 rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) alpha gene transcribed two promoters, denoted PI PII, direct regulated expression tissue-specific manner. Induction ACC, rate-controlling enzyme fatty acid biosynthesis, occurs liver response feeding high carbohydrate, low fat diet, conditions favor enhanced lipogenesis. induction mainly due increases PI promoter activity. used primary cultured hepatocytes rat investigate glucose regulation ACC expression. Glucose insulin synergistically activated expression ACC mRNAs transcribed PI promoter little effect PII mRNAs. Glucose treatment stimulated PI promoter activity transfection assays glucose-regulated element identified (-126/-102), homologous previously described responsive genes, including l-type pyruvate kinase, S(14) fatty acid synthase. Mutation element eliminated response glucose. region ACC PI promoter able bind liver nuclear factor designated ChoRF interacts conserved glucose-regulated elements. ACC PI element also capable conferring strong response glucose linked heterologous promoter. conclude induction ACC gene expression lipogenic conditions hepatocytes mediated part activation glucose-regulated transcription factor, ChoRF, stimulates transcription PI promoter. Similar mechanisms operate related genes permitting coordinate induction lipogenic pathway.
