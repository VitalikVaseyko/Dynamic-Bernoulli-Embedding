 Hummingbirds one highest mass-specific metabolic rates among vertebrate animals. High activities pyruvate carboxylase (an enzyme involved gluconeogenesis) acetyl-CoA carboxylase (an enzyme involved fatty acid synthesis) hummingbird liver indicate biosynthetic capacity adjusted cope high metabolic fuel requirements imposed small size hovering flight. high biosynthetic capacity supported correspondingly high oxidative capacity, judged qualitatively abundance mitochondria electron micrographs quantitatively presence high citrate synthase activity (a Krebs cycle enzyme). support high metabolic fuel requirements, hummingbirds may possess biosynthetically active livers nature.
