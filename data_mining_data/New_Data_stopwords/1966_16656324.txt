 Macroconidia Fusarium solani f. phascoli detectable capacity respire glucose anaerobically; germinated spores mycelium, hand, ferment glucose, although slowly.Extracts ungerminated spores contain hexokinase, phosphohexoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triose phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglyceric kinase, enolase, phosphoglyceric mutase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase. follows, therefore, appearance fermentative capacity spore germination cannot ascribed de novo synthesis enzymes.During germination mycelial development specific activity enzymes named except phosphohexoisomerase aldolase increases 2- 8-fold. Specific activity enzymes substantially higher fermentative capacity intact cells, i.e., none limiting anaerobic respiration.The enzymatic assay data consistent conclusion reached earlier basis studies aerobic glucose metabolism, process germination involves acceleration pre-existing metabolic systems rather appearance new pathways.
