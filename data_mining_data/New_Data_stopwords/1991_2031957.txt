 L-type pyruvate kinase gene regulation excellent model gene control hormones diet. vivo ex vivo experiments allowed us established thyroid hormones glucocorticoids act pyruvate kinase gene expression post-transcriptional level. contrast, glucose insulin together stimulate transcription gene glucagon inhibits it. Insulin glucose individually inefficient glucagon-dependent transcriptional inhibition seems dominant insulin + glucose-dependent activation. 14-kbp fragment encompassing entire pyruvate kinase gene 3.2-kbp 5' flanking sequences expressed transgenic mice exactly like endogenous gene; 3.2-kbp upstream region sufficient confer tissue-specific hormone/diet-regulated expression reporter genes. vivo, DNAse hypersensitivity analysis revealed presence 3 liver-specific groups hypersensitive sites (HSS). proximal sites, + 1 -183 bp respect start site transcription, were, addition, transcription-dependent. nature functional role proteins binding proximal upstream sequence analyzed vitro binding cell free transcription experiments. existence upstream cis-acting elements investigated transient transfection assays using differentiated hepatoma cell lines hepatocytes primary culture. experiments permitted detection extinguisher active hepatoma Hep G2 cells hepatocytes, activating element could correspond distal HSS. Unfortunately, investigation yet allowed us determine accuracy DNA elements responsible response diet hormones.
