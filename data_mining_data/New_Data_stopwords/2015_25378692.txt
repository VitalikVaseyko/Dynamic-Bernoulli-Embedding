 Mitochondrial NAD-malic enzyme (ME) and/or cytosolic/plastidic NADP-ME combined cytosolic/plastidic pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) catalyze two key steps light-period malate decarboxylation underpin secondary CO(2) fixation Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) species. report generation phenotypic characterization transgenic RNA interference lines obligate CAM species Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi reduced activities NAD-ME PPDK. Transgenic line rNAD-ME1 8%, rPPDK1 5% wild-type level activity, showed dramatic changes light/dark cycle CAM CO(2) fixation. well-watered conditions, lines fixed CO(2) light; thus performed C(3) photosynthesis. alternative malate decarboxylase, NADP-ME, appear compensate reduction NAD-ME, suggesting NAD-ME key decarboxylase CAM. activity CAM enzymes reduced consequence knocking either NAD-ME PPDK activity, particularly phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) PPDK rNAD-ME1. Furthermore, circadian clock-controlled phosphorylation PPC dark reduced lines, especially rNAD-ME1. consequence circadian rhythms PPC phosphorylation, PPC kinase transcript levels activity, classic circadian rhythm CAM CO(2) fixation lost, dampened toward arrhythmia, constant light temperature conditions. Surprisingly, oscillations transcript abundance core circadian clock genes also became arrhythmic rNAD-ME1 line, suggesting perturbing CAM K. fedtschenkoi feeds back perturb central circadian clock.
