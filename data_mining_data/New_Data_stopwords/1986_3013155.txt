 Hepatocytes isolated rats fed chow diet low-protein (8%) diet used study effects various factors flux branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex. activity complex also determined cell-free extracts hepatocytes. Hepatocytes isolated chow-fed rats greater flux rates (decarboxylation rates 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate) hepatocytes isolated rats fed low-protein diet. Oxidizable substrates tended inhibit flux branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase, inhibition greater hepatocytes isolated rats fed low-protein diet. 2-Chloro-4-methylpentanoate (inhibitor branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase), dichloroacetate (inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase) dibutyryl cyclic AMP (inhibitor glycolysis) effective stimulators branched-chain oxo acid decarboxylation hepatocytes rats fed low-protein diet, little effect hepatocytes rats fed chow diet. Activity measurements indicated branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex mainly (96%) active (dephosphorylated) state hepatocytes chow-fed rats, partially (50%) active state hepatocytes rats fed low-protein diet. Oxidizable substrates markedly decreased activity state enzyme hepatocytes rats fed low-protein diet, much less effect hepatocytes chow-fed rats. 2-Chloro-4-methylpentanoate dichloroacetate increased activity state enzyme hepatocytes rats fed low-protein diet, effect activity state enzyme hepatocytes chow-fed rats. results indicate protein starvation greatly increases sensitivity hepatic branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex regulation covalent modification.
