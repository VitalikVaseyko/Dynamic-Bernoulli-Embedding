 Glioblastoma (GBM) aggressive primary brain tumor poor prognosis. Here, studied effects phenformin, mitochondrial complex inhibitor potent chemical analog diabetes drug metformin inhibition cell growth induction apoptosis glioma stem cells (GSCs) using vitro vivo models. Phenformin inhibited self-renewal GSCs, decreased expression stemness mesenchymal markers increased expression miR-124, 137 let-7. Silencing let-7 abrogated phenformin effects self-renewal GSCs via pathway associated inhibition H19 HMGA2 expression. Moreover, demonstrate phenformin inhibited tumor growth prolonged overall survival mice orthotopically transplanted GSCs. Combined treatments phenformin temozolomide exerted increased antitumor effect GSCs vitro vivo. addition, dichloroacetate, inhibitor glycolysis enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, decreases lactic acidosis induced biguanides, enhanced phenformin effects induction cell death GSCs prolonged survival xenograft-bearing mice. results demonstrate first time phenformin targets GSCs efficiently combined current therapies GBM treatment GSC eradication.
