 CONTEXT: Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) used traditionally Asian countries treat various disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: study effect H. cordata ethyl acetate (HC-EA) extract high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. MATERIALS METHODS: HFD fed rats orally dosed HC-EA (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) daily 8 weeks lipid profiles protein expressions hepatocytes evaluated. RESULTS: HFD rats showed increase (p < 0.05) plasma lipid levels total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), free fatty acids (FFAs), reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Treatment HC-EA extract (300 mg/kg) restored changes plasma lipid levels TC, TG, LDL, FFA, HDL HFD-fed rats 34.8, 31.1, 51.4, 32.4, 56.3%, respectively, compared control rats (p < 0.01). HC-EA treatment also decreased hepatic lipid accumulation (p < 0.001 300 mg/kg) improved hepatic histological lesions. HC-EA extract enhanced AMPK phosphorylation primary downstream targeting enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), up-regulated gene expression carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), down-regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1, fatty acid synthase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase protein levels livers HFD-fed rats. Further, increased expression hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) composition CYP2E1 CYP4A also suppressed. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: Data suggest HC-EA extract might act regulating AMPK-dependent pathway related mediators might used treating obesity-related liver diseases.
