 UNLABELLED: Cell division bacteria driven cytoskeletal ring structure, Z ring, composed polymers tubulin-like protein FtsZ. Z-ring formation must tightly regulated ensure faithful cell division, several mechanisms influence positioning timing Z-ring assembly described. Another important yet poorly understood aspect cell division regulation need coordinate division cell growth nutrient availability. study, demonstrated first time cell division intimately linked central carbon metabolism model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. showed deletion gene encoding pyruvate kinase (pyk), produces pyruvate final reaction glycolysis, rescues assembly defect temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutant significant effects Z-ring formation wild-type B. subtilis cells. Addition exogenous pyruvate restores normal division absence pyruvate kinase enzyme, implicating pyruvate key metabolite coordination bacterial growth division. results support model pyruvate levels coupled Z-ring assembly via enzyme actually metabolizes pyruvate, E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase. shown protein localizes nucleoid pyruvate-dependent manner may stimulate efficient Z-ring formation cell center nutrient-rich conditions, cells must divide frequently. IMPORTANCE: bacteria coordinate cell cycle processes nutrient availability growth fundamental yet unresolved question microbiology. Recent breakthroughs revealed nutritional information transmitted directly metabolic pathways cell cycle machinery serve mechanism fine-tuning cell cycle processes response changes environmental conditions. identified novel link glycolysis cell division Bacillus subtilis. showed pyruvate, final product glycolysis, plays important role maintaining normal division. Nutrient-dependent changes pyruvate levels affect function cell division protein FtsZ, likely modifying activity enzyme metabolizes pyruvate, namely, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha. Ultimately system may help coordinate bacterial division nutritional conditions ensure survival newborn cells.
