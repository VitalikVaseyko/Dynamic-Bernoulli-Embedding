 Defining metabolic programs underlie stem cell maintenance essential developing strategies manipulate stem cell capacity. Mammalian hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain cell cycle quiescence hypoxic microenvironment. proposed HSCs exhibit distinct metabolic phenotype conditions. directly investigated idea using metabolomic analysis found HSCs generate adenosine-5'-triphosphate anaerobic glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk)-dependent mechanism. Elevated Pdk expression leads active suppression influx glycolytic metabolites mitochondria. Pdk overexpression glycolysis-defective HSCs restored glycolysis, cell cycle quiescence, stem cell capacity, loss Pdk2 Pdk4 attenuated HSC quiescence, glycolysis, transplantation capacity. Moreover, treatment HSCs Pdk mimetic promoted survival transplantation capacity. Thus, glycolytic metabolic status governed Pdk acts cell cycle checkpoint modulates HSC quiescence function.
