 IIA(Glc), glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, allosteric inhibitor Escherichia coli glycerol kinase. linked-functions initial-velocity enzyme kinetics approach used define MgATP-IIA(Glc) heterotropic allosteric interaction. interaction measured allosteric coupling constants Q W, describe mutual effect ligands binding affinity effect allosteric ligand V(max), respectively. Allosteric interactions ligands display K-type activation V-type inhibition. allosteric coupling constant Q 3, showing cooperative coupling ligand increases affinity binding other. allosteric coupling constant W 0.1, showing allosteric inhibition partial binding IIA(Glc) saturation reduce V(max) zero.
