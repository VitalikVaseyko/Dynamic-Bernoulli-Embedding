 Glucose-6-phosphatase, key enzyme homeostatic regulation blood glucose concentration, catalyzes terminal step gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis. Glucose, product glucose-6-phosphatase reaction, dramatically increases level glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA transcripts primary hepatocytes (20-fold), maximum response obtained glucose concentration low 11 mM. Glucose specifically increases glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. rat hepatoma-derived cell line, Fao, glucose increases glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA modestly (3-fold). presence high glucose concentrations, overexpression glucokinase Fao cells via recombinant adenovirus vectors increases lactate production level found primary hepatocytes increases glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression 21-fold. Similar overexpression hexokinase Fao cells high levels glucose increase lactate production change response glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA glucose. Glucokinase overexpression Fao cells blunts previously reported inhibitory effect insulin glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression cells. Raising cellular concentration fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, potent effector direction carbon flux gluconeogenic glycolytic pathways, also stimulated glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression Fao cells. Increasing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration 15-fold range (12 +/- 1 187 +/- 17 pmol/plate) via adenoviral vector overexpression system, led 6-fold increase (0.32 +/- 0. 03 2.2 +/- 0.33 arbitrary units mRNA) glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression concomitant increase glycolysis decrease gluconeogenesis. Also, effects fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate concentrations fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene expression stimulatory, leading 5-6-fold increase mRNA level 15-fold range fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level. Liver pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA unchanged manipulation fructose-2,6-bisphosphate level.
