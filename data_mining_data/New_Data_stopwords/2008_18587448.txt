 BACKGROUND PURPOSE: M2-type pyruvate kinase (M2PK) found interact directly 'ITAM' region gamma chain high-affinity IgE receptor (FcvarepsilonRI). hypothesis mast cell degranulation might require FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK activity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells, effects directly inhibiting M2PK preventing FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK (disinhibition) degranulation measured hexosaminidase release. Effects blocking FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK also assessed vivo mouse model allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness. KEY RESULTS: Activation FcvarepsilonRI RBL-2H3 cells caused rapid phosphorylation tyrosine residues M2PK, associated decrease M2PK enzymatic activity. inverse correlation M2PK activity mast cell degranulation. FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK involved Src kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC calcium. Direct inhibition M2PK potentiated FcvarepsilonRI-mediated degranulation prevention FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK attenuated mast cell degranulation. Transfection RBL-2H3 cells M1PK prevents FcvarepsilonRI-induced inhibition M2PK, markedly reduced degranulation exogenous M1PK (i.p.) inhibited ovalbumin-induced airway hyper-responsiveness vivo. CONCLUSIONS IMPLICATIONS: identified new control point novel biochemical pathway process mast cell degranulation. study suggests FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition M2PK crucial step responses allergens. Moreover, manipulation glycolytic processes intermediates could provide novel strategies treatment allergic diseases.
