 Goldfish injected cadmium chloride synthesized metallothionein. Ten days first injection, cadmium reached maximum metallothionein peak (2 micrograms/ml) obtained gel filtration liver cytosol. Pyruvate kinase activity inhibited beginning experiment; fourth day, enzyme activity started increase reach control level. Alkaline phosphatase fructose biphosphatase show apparent inhibition. results reported, detoxifying role metallothionein could suggested.
