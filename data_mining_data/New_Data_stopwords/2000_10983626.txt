 aim study characterize rapid effects insulin tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate amplify cell surface insulin binding capacity isolated rat adipocytes. effect 20 min insulin treatment (1000 microU/ml) 2- 3-fold (p < 0.01) cells treated medium containing 5.6 mM D-glucose, totally absent glucose-free medium. carbon energy sources, fructose pyruvate, could partly substitute D-glucose, approximately 1.5-fold insulin effect. Moreover, inhibiting transmembrane glucose transport cytochalasin B completely blocked effect insulin enhance cell surface binding. effect vanadate partly glucose-dependent, since submaximal effect (1.5- 2-fold, p<0.05) seen also absence glucose. tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein markedly blunted effect vanadate (from 3- 4-fold approximately 2-fold, p < 0.05) also indicating importance tyrosine phosphorylation-related mechanisms upregulation cell surface insulin binding. Glycosylation insulin receptors mechanism effect appears unlikely since neither effect insulin vanadate altered glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. time course insulin effect displayed long duration (at least 6 h), suggesting maintenance role insulin keeping receptors accessible ligand binding cell surface. conclusion, effect insulin vanadate upregulate cell-surface insulin receptors energy-dependent extent specifically glucose-dependent.
