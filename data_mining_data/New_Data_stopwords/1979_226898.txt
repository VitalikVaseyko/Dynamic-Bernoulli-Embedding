 paper starts series red blood cell (RBC) metabolism patients chronic renal failure (CRF). glycolytic enzyme levels vitro half-lives patients' RBCs determined. number enzymes (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase) showed higher activities normal control RBCs. enzyme activities normal. results discussed several possible mechanisms considered. favour point view shortened life span RBCs CRF, making unstable enzymes glycolytic sequence appear increase compared normal controls.
