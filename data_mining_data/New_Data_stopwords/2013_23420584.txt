 activation oncogenic signaling pathways induces reprogramming glucose metabolism tumor cells increases lactic acid secretion tumor microenvironment. well-known characteristic tumor cells, termed Warburg effect, candidate target antitumor therapy. Previous reports show lactic acid secreted tumor cells proinflammatory mediator activates IL-23/IL-17 pathway, thereby inducing inflammation, angiogenesis tissue remodeling. Here, show lactic acid, specifically acidification causes, increases arginase (ARG1) expression macrophages inhibit T-cell proliferation activation. Accordingly, hypothesized counteraction immune effects lactic acid might suppress tumor development. show dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, targets macrophages suppress activation IL-23/IL-17 pathway expression ARG1 lactic acid. Furthermore, lactic acid-pretreated macrophages inhibited CD8+ T-cell proliferation, CD8+ T-cell proliferation restored macrophages pretreated lactic acid DCA. DCA treatment decreased ARG1 expression tumor-infiltrating immune cells increased number IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ cells NK cells tumor-bearing mouse spleen. Although DCA treatment alone suppress tumor growth, increased antitumor immunotherapeutic activity Poly(IC) CD8+ cell- NK cell-sensitive tumor models. Therefore, DCA acts tumor cells suppress glycolysis also immune cells improve immune status modulated lactic acid increase effectiveness antitumor immunotherapy.
