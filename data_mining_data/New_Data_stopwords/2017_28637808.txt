 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) chronic metabolic disease complicated pathogenesis targeting gluconeogenesis inhibition promising strategy anti-diabetic drug discovery. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) classified distinct families heterotrimeric G proteins, primarily including Galphas, Galphai Galphaq. Galphas-coupled GPCRs function potently regulation hepatic gluconeogenesis activating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase (PKA) pathway Galphai-coupled GPCRs exhibit inhibitory effect adenylyl cyclase reduce intracellular cAMP level. However, little known regulation Galphaq-coupled GPCRs hepatic gluconeogenesis. Here, small-molecule 2-(2,4-dimethoxy-3-methylphenyl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)-9-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydr opyrido[3',2':4,5]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-one (DMT) determined suppress hepatic glucose production reduce mRNA levels gluconeogenic genes. Treatment DMT db/db mice decreased fasting blood glucose hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels, improved glucose tolerance pyruvate tolerance. Mechanism study demonstrated DMT-inhibited gluconeogenesis regulating Galphaq/phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-mediated calcium (Ca(2+))/calmodulin (CaM)/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) signaling pathway. knowledge, DMT might first reported small molecule able suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis regulating Galphaq signaling, current work also highlighted potential DMT treatment T2DM.
