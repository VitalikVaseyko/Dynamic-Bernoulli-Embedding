 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) pivotal role islet metabolism. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) regulate glucose oxidation inhibitory phosphorylation PDC. Starvation increases islet PDK activity (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 270:E988-E994, 1996). study, using antibodies PDK1, PDK2, PDK4 (no sufficiently specific antibodies yet available PDK3), identified PDK isoform profile pancreatic islet delineated effects starvation (48 h) protein expression individual PDK isoforms. Rat islets demonstrated contain three PDK isoforms, PDK1, PDK2, PDK4. Using immunoblot analysis antibodies raised individual recombinant PDK isoforms, demonstrated increased islet protein expression PDK4 response starvation (2.3-fold; P < 0.01). Protein expression PDK1 PDK2 suppressed response starvation (by 27% [P < 0.01] 10% [NS], respectively). demonstrated activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) selective agonist WY14,643 24 h vivo leads specific upregulation islet PDK4 protein expression 1.8-fold (P < 0.01), absence change islet PDK1 PDK2 protein expression conjunction 2.2-fold increase (P < 0.01) islet PPAR-alpha protein expression. Thus, although changes islet PPAR-alpha expression observed starvation protocol, activation PPAR-alpha vivo may potential mechanism underlying upregulation islet PDK4 protein expression starvation. evaluated effects antecedent changes PDK profile and/or PPAR-alpha activation induced starvation PPAR-alpha activation vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) isolated islets. GSIS 20 mmol/l glucose modestly impaired incubation exogenous triglyceride (1 mmol/l triolein) ( approximately 20% inhibition; P < 0.05) islets fed rats. Starvation (48 h) impaired GSIS absence triolein (by 57%; P < 0.001), GSIS addition triolein differ significantly islets fed starved rats. GSIS islets prepared WY14,643-treated fed rats differ significantly seen islets control fed rats, response triolein addition resembled islets prepared fed rather starved rats.
