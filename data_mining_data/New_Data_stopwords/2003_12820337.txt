 INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways focus interest therapeutic interventions. oncoprotein HER-2/neu shows tyrosine kinase activity leading phosphorylation activation numerous second-messenger systems. One target phosphorylation processes assumed tumor type M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK) shown elevated metastatic breast cancer. MATERIALS METHODS: measured plasma levels HER-2/neu, TuM2-PK tyrosine-phosphorylated TuM2-PK (p-TuM2-PK) 69 patients (pts) breast cancer correlated parameters classical tumor marker CA 27.29. samples measured ELISA assays CA 27.29 determined automated chemiluminescence assay. analysis, formed 5 subgroups according plasma HER-2/neu levels (group 1: < 15 ng/ml, n = 28; group 2: 15 < = x < 50 ng/ml, n = 21; group 3: 50 < = x < 100 ng/ml, n = 9; group 4: 100 < = x < 500 ng/ml, n = 7; group 5: > = 500 ng/ml, n = 4). RESULTS: HER-2/neu group 1 group 5, statistically significant increase CA 27.29 35.8 U/ml 1095.8 U/ml (p < 0.001). also trend increasing TuM2-PK levels increasing HER-2/neu levels (p = 0.126). lowest extinction (0.088) highest extinction result (2.167) p-TuM2-PK found 25-fold increase, reproducible spiking dilution experiments proving TuM2-PK phosphorylated tyrosine residues certain extent. However, correlation plasma HER-2/neu p-TuM2-PK levels. CONCLUSION: TuM2-PK phosphorylated tyrosine residues breast cancer patients. Using shed antigen HER-2/neu plasma surrogate marker, find evidence phosphorylation initiated oncoprotein HER-2/neu.
