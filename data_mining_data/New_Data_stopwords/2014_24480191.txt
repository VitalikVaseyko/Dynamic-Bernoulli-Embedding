 investigate sensitization metformin-cytotoxicity, cancer cells treated dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Metformin-cytotoxicity mainly dependent glucose availability reducing power generated pentose phosphate pathway, whereas DCA cotreatment enhanced metformin-cytotoxicity via reprogramming glucose metabolism inhibiting PDK increasing mitochondrial respiration. DCA cotreatment elicited cell death rather cell survival despite high glucose high GSH condition. conclusion, DCA sensitized metformin-cytotoxicity reprogramming glucose metabolism part aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial oxidation, evidenced measurements glucose consumption, lactate release, ratio oxygen consumption rate/extracellular acidification rate.
