 metabolic consequences external hypercapnia (1% CO2) assessed rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) presence absence circulating levels beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. External hypercapnia caused severe extracellular respiratory acidosis less pronounced reduction hepatic intracellular pH (pHi). pHi restored prehypercapnic values 48 hr continuous hypercapnia due elevation bicarbonate levels. presence propranolol, hypercapnia elicited pronounced activation pyruvate kinase (PyK) (measured low high phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentrations) inactivation total glycogen phosphorylase (GPase) glycogen phosphorylase (GPase a). absence propranolol, changes enzyme activities significantly reduced (low PEP PyK activity) totally absent (GPase inactivation). results suggest beta adrenoceptor-mediated phenomena offset disruptive effects hypercapnia PyK GPase activities may important control gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis acid-base disturbance. adrenergic effects related modification hepatic intracellular acid-base status. Hypercapnia induced rapid depletion liver glycogen concomitant hyperglycemia. effects prevented pretreating fish propranolol appeared unrelated changes GPase activity. results suggest factors adrenergic activation GPase involved enhancement liver glycogenolysis.
