 complete cell cycle rat thymocytes stimulated concanavalin interleukin 2, activity mRNA level pyruvate kinase reached maximum (8-12-fold increase) 48 h stimulation coinciding S-phase cell cycle. Increases cellular enzyme activity, pyruvate kinase protein, mRNA levels correlated 48 h culture. Afterwards pyruvate kinase activity mRNA levels decrease, whereas pyruvate kinase protein continues increase throughout mitosis. change specific pyruvate kinase activity points posttranslational modification enzyme besides transcriptional regulation. presence M2-type isozyme determined following methods: (a) native cellulose acetate electrophoresis activity staining, (b) Northern blot hybridization M1- M2-specific cDNA probes, (c) determination kinetic parameters. isozyme pattern change cell cycle progression. induction pyruvate kinase completely abolished 2-difluoromethylornithine-mediated polyamine depletion. However, proportion hybridizable pyruvate kinase mRNA affected. data suggest requirement polyamines efficient translation rather transcription cell growth.
