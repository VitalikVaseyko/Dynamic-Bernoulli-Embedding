 1. epididymal adipose tissue synthesizing fatty acids fructose vitro, addition insulin led moderate increase fructose uptake, considerable increase flow fructose carbon atoms fatty acid, decrease steady-state concentration lactate pyruvate medium, net uptake lactate pyruvate medium. concluded insulin accelerates step span pyruvate-->fatty acid. 2. Mitochondria prepared fat-cells exposed insulin put citrate non-insulin-treated controls conditions oxaloacetate moiety citrate formed pyruvate pyruvate carboxylase conditions formed malate. suggested insulin treatment fat-cells led persistent activation pyruvate dehydrogenase. 3. Insulin treatment epididymal fat-pads vitro increased activity pyruvate dehydrogenase measured extracts tissue even absence added substrate; activities pyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase NAD-malate dehydrogenase changed insulin. 4. effect insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase activity inhibited adrenaline, adrenocorticotrophic hormone dibutyryl cyclic AMP (6-N,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate). effect insulin reproduced prostaglandin E(1), like insulin may lower tissue concentration cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate) inhibit lipolysis. 5. Adipose tissue pyruvate dehydrogenase extracts mitochondria almost totally inactivated incubation ATP reactivated incubation 10mm-Mg(2+). respect properties similar pyruvate dehydrogenase heart kidney evidence given inactivation activation catalysed ATP-dependent kinase Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatase. Evidence given insulin may act increasing proportion active (dephosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase. 6. Cyclic AMP could shown influence activity pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondria various conditions incubation. 7. results discussed relation control fatty acid synthesis adipose tissue role cyclic AMP mediating effects insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase.
