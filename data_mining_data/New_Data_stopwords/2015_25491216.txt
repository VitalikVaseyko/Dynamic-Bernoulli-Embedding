 OBJECTIVES: investigate mechanisms anti-hyperglycemic effect Costus speciosus (C. speciosus) root ethanolic extracts (CSREt) assessing action insulin synthesis glucose catabolic enzyme gene expression activities streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats. METHODS: study carried Biochemical Laboratory, Faculty Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt July August 2013. Sixty male albino rats (120 +/- 20 g weight, 6 months old) used divided 6 groups (n=10). Two groups served diabetic nondiabetic controls. Four groups STZ diabetic animals given oral C. speciosus (CSREt) doses 200, 400, 600 mg/kg body weight, 600 microg/kg body weight standard drug glibenclamide 4 weeks. RESULTS: CSREt 400 600 mg/kg body weight induced decrease blood glucose increase serum insulin level, glucokinase (GK), aldolase, pyruvate kinase (PK), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), glycogen synthase activities addition higher expression level insulin, insulin receptor (IRA), GK, PK, SDH, glucose transporting protein. CONCLUSION: C. speciosus anti-hyperglycemic activity. induces insulin secretion release cells, well stimulates tissue's insulin sensitivity leading increase tissues' glucose uptake, storage, oxidation.
