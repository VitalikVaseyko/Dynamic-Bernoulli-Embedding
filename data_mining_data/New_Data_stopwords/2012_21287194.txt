 Endurance exercise shown reduce pancreatic islets glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Anaplerotic/cataplerotic pathways directly related GSIS signaling. However, effect endurance training upon pancreatic islets anaplerotic enzymes still unknown. sense, tested hypothesis endurance exercise decreases GSIS reducing anaplerotic/cataplerotic enzymes content. Male Wistar rats randomly assigned one four experimental groups follows: control sedentary group (CTL), trained 1 day per week (TRE1x), trained 3 days per week (TRE3x) trained 5 days per week (TRE5x) submitted 8 weeks endurance-training protocol. training protocol, pancreatic islets isolated incubated basal (2.8 mM) stimulating (16.7 mM) glucose concentrations GSIS measurement radioimmunoassay. addition, pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) content quantified western blotting. data showed 8 weeks chronic endurance exercise reduced GSIS 50% dose-response manner according weekly exercise frequency. PYC showed significant twofold increase TRE3x. PYC enhancement even higher TRE5x (p < 0.0001). PDH PDK4 reached significant 25 50% enhancement, respectively compared CTL. ACL GDH also reported significant 50 75% increase, respectively. absence exercise-induced correlations among GSIS anaplerotic/cataplerotic enzymes suggests exercise may control insulin release activating signaling pathways. observed anaplerotic cataplerotic enzymes enhancement might related beta-cell surviving rather insulin secretion.
