 Cancer known unique metabolic features Warburg effect. Current cancer therapy moved forward cytotoxic treatment personalized, targeted therapies, could lead specific metabolic changes, potentially monitored imaging methods. paper addressed important aspects study cancer metabolism using image techniques, focusing opportunities challenges magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-MRS, positron emission tomography (PET), mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) mapping cancer metabolism. Finally, highlighted future possibilities integrated vivo PET/MR imaging systems, together situ MSI tissue analytical platform, may become ultimate technologies unraveling understanding molecular complexities aspects cancer metabolism. comprehensive imaging investigations might provide information pharmacometabolomics, biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response monitoring clinical medicine.
