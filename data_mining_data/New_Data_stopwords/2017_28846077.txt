 Cooperation cancer cells stromal cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), revealed mechanism sustaining cancer cell survival growth. current study, focus metabolic interactions MRC5 lung fibroblasts lung cancer cells (A549 H1299) using co-culture experiments studying changes metabolic protein expression profile growth migration abilities. Using western blotting, confocal microscopy RT-PCR, observed co-cultures MRC5 respond upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. contrast, cancer cells increase expression glucose transporters (GLUT1), LDH5, PDH kinase levels phosphorylated/inactivated pPDH. H1299 cells growing culture medium fibroblasts exhibit 'metastasis-like' phenomenon forming nests within fibroblast area. LDH5 pPDH drastically upregulated nests. growth rate MRC5 cancer cells increased co-cultures. Suppression LDHA PDK1 cancer cells abrogates stimulatory signal cancer cells fibroblasts. Incubation MRC5 fibroblasts lactate resulted increase LDHB PDH expression. Silencing PDH gene fibroblasts, silencing PDK1 LDHA gene tumor cells, impedes cancer cell's migration ability. Overall, metabolic cooperation lung cancer cells fibroblasts confirmed context direct Warburg effect, thus fibroblasts reinforce aerobic metabolism support intensified anaerobic glycolytic pathways exploited cancer cells.
