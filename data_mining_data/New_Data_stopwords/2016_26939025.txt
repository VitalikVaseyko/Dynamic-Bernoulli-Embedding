 increased risk colorectal cancer related development metabolic syndromes including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia. high circulatory levels glucose and/or insulin application exogenous insulin may promote carcinogenesis, cancer progression metastasis, attributed Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis. attempted resolve existing questions applying glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). According vitro studies performed, glycolysis colorectal cancer cells could interrupted 2DG decreased cellular productions ATP lactate. addition, 2DG induced apoptosis cell cycle arrest, inhibited proliferation, migration invasion cells. Since insulin stimulate cellular uptake hexose, including 2DG, combination 2DG insulin improved cytotoxicity 2DG meanwhile overcame cancer-promoting effects insulin. vitro study provided viewpoint 2DG potential therapeutic agent colorectal cancer, especially patients concomitant hyperinsulinemia treated exogenous insulin.
