 Recent studies suggest time day food consumed dramatically influences clinically-relevant cardiometabolic parameters (e.g., adiposity, insulin sensitivity, cardiac function). Meal feeding benefits may result daily periods feeding and/or fasting, highlighting need improved understanding temporal adaptation cardiometabolic tissues (e.g., heart) fasting. studies may provide mechanistic insight regarding time-of-day-dependent feeding/fasting cycles influence cardiac function. hypothesized fasting sleep period elicits beneficial adaptation heart transcriptional, translational, metabolic levels. test hypothesis, temporal adaptation investigated wild-type mice fasted 24-h, either 12-h light/sleep phase 12-h dark/awake phase. Fasting maximally induced fatty acid responsive genes (e.g., Pdk4) dark/active phase; transcriptional changes mirrored translational (e.g., PDK4) metabolic flux (e.g., glucose/oleate oxidation) levels. Similarly, maximal repression myocardial p-mTOR protein synthesis rates occurred dark phase; parameters remained elevated heart fasted mice light phase. contrast, markers autophagy (e.g., LC3II) exhibited peak responses fasting light phase. Collectively, data show responsiveness heart fasting temporally partitioned. Autophagy peaks light/sleep phase, repression glucose utilization protein synthesis maximized dark/active phase. speculate sleep phase fasting may benefit cardiac function augmentation protein/cellular constituent turnover.
