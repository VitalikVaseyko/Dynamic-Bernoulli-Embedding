 PURPOSE: identify biological markers related progression prognosis GBC. METHODS: expressions pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) activin receptor type IC (ACVR 1C) 46 squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas (SC/ASC) 80 adenocarcinomas (AC) examined using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Positive PKM2 negative ACVR 1C expressions significantly associated lymph node metastasis, invasion TNM stage SC/ASCs ACs. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed either elevated PKM2 loss ACVR 1C expression significantly correlated shorter average survival times SC/ASC AC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed positive PKM2 expression loss ACVR 1C expression poor prognosis biomarkers SC/ASC AC patients. CONCLUSIONS: study suggested PKM2 overexpression marker metastasis, invasion poor prognosis GBC. ACVR 1C tumor suppressor, lowered ACVR 1C expression important marker metastasis, invasion, prognosis GBC.
