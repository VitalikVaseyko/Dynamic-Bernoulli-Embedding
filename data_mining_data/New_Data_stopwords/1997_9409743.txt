 Proliferating cells tumour cells maintain high glycolytic rate even aerobic conditions. FTO2B cells, rat hepatoma cell line, show high activities glycolytic enzymes. Within culture period 48 h cell number increases 5-fold. Replacement glucose pyruvate culture medium lowers glycolytic enzyme activity prevents proliferation. Transfection assays revealed glucose deprivation dramatically decreases transcriptional activities Sp1-dependent aldolase pyruvate kinase promoters leading reduced reporter gene expression. Sp1 binding activity also inhibited ocadaic acid, inhibitor protein phosphatase 1. Western blot analyses nuclear extracts FTO2B cells cultured presence absence glucose revealed differences phosphorylation state Sp1. results conclude glucose increases amount dephosphorylated form Sp1 higher DNA binding activity. consequence gene expression glycolytic enzymes increased prerequisite cell proliferation.
