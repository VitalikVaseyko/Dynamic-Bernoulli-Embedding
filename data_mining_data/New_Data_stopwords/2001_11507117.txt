 Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) known use dietary carbohydrates poorly. One hypotheses explain poor utilisation dietary glucose fish dysfunction nutritional regulation hepatic glucose metabolism. study, obtained partial clones rainbow trout cDNAs coding glucose transporter (Glut2), enzymes 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) pyruvate kinase (PK). deduced amino acid sequences highly similar mammals (up 80% similarity). study nutritional regulation, Glut2 gene highly expressed liver irrespective nutritional status trout, agreement role transporter input (during refeeding) output (during fasting) glucose liver. Moreover, whereas PK FBPase gene expression high irrespective nutritional status, levels hepatic 6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase mRNA higher fish fed carbohydrates fish deprived food. high levels hepatic PK, Glut2 6PF-2K/F-2,6BPase gene expression observed study suggest high potential tissue carbohydrate utilisation rainbow trout. persistence high level FBPase gene expression suggests absence regulation gluconeogenic pathway dietary carbohydrates.
