 patterns survival isotope-labelled erythrocytes examined patients suffering two variants congenital non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia decreased erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. one variant, primary PK defect (PPKD) random destruction erythrocytes predominant process haemolysis. second variant, primary magnesium activated adenosine triphosphatase (ATP-ase) (Mg++) deficiency secondary decrease PK activity, erythrocytes destroyed senescence. Two subpopulations labelled erythrocytes different destruction rates observed patients examined, except one second variant, mild haemolysis. Splenectomy, performed two patient, successful variant PPKD.
