 BACKGROUND: Protein secretion fundamental process living cells. Proteins either secreted via classical non-classical pathways. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, gluconeogenic enzymes extracellular fraction/periplasm cells grown media containing low glucose. Following transfer cells high glucose media, levels extracellular fraction reduced rapidly. hypothesized changes secretome restricted gluconeogenic enzymes. goal current study use proteomic approach identify extracellular proteins whose levels changed cells transferred low high glucose media. RESULTS: performed two iTRAQ experiments identified 347 proteins present extracellular fraction including metabolic enzymes, proteins involved oxidative stress, protein folding, proteins unknown functions. proteins contain typical ER-Golgi signal sequences. Moreover, levels many proteins decreased upon transfer cells media containing low high glucose media. Using extraction procedure Western blotting, confirmed metabolic enzymes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase), proteins involved oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase thioredoxin), heat shock proteins (Ssa1p, Hsc82p, Hsp104p) extracellular fraction growth low glucose levels extracellular proteins reduced cells transferred media containing high glucose. proteins associated membranes vesicle-enriched fraction. also showed small vesicles present extracellular fraction cells grown low glucose. Following transfer low high glucose media 30 minutes, 98% vesicles disappeared extracellular fraction. CONCLUSIONS: data indicate transferring cells low high glucose media induces rapid decline levels large number extracellular proteins disappearance small vesicles extracellular fraction. Therefore, conclude secretome undergoes dynamic changes transition glucose-deficient glucose-rich media. extracellular proteins contain typical ER signal sequences, suggesting secreted via non-classical pathway.
