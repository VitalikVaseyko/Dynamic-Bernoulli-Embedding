 Two forms anaerobic Escherichia coli K-12 pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) separated ammonium sulphate fractionations. Pyruvate kinases allosteric pyruvate kinase II non-allosteric phosphoenolpyruvate. addition 1 mM FDP reversed allostery normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. AMP effect, whereas 8 mM ATP completely inhibited enzyme. enzyme showed normal kinetics ADP substrate. Mg2+ Mn2+ stimulated whereas Cu2+ severely inhibited enzyme, could reversed addition 1 mM FDP. Citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate alanine inhibited enzyme, whereas phenylalanine effect. allosteric pyruvate kinase aerobic cultures activated FDP, also AMP. FDP changed Km Vmax, whereas AMP influenced Km. aerobic-anaerobic transition, pyruvate kinase synthesis increases reaches maximum anaerobic conditions. degree FDP activation remains constant, AMP activation lost transition. Aerobic cultures E. coli K-12 grown gluconeogenic substrates exhibited pyruvate kinase II activity (non-allosteric), stimulated FDP AMP. suggested E. coli may two types pyruvate kinase II depending substrate two types pyruvate kinase depending oxygen tension medium.
