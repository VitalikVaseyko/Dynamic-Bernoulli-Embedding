 predominant use glucose anaerobically cancer cells (Warburg effect) may important characteristic majority cells common and, therefore, potential metabolic pathway targeted cancer treatment. effect relates fuel oxidation, dietary manipulation hypothesized important strategy cancer treatment. such, concept ketogenic diet (KD) cancer emerged metabolic therapy (ie, targeting cancer cell metabolism) rather dietary approach. therapeutic mechanisms action high-fat, moderate-to-low protein, very-low-carbohydrate diet may potentially influence cancer treatment prognosis. Considering lack dietetics-focused narrative review topic, compiled evidence related use diet humans diverse cancer types stages, also focusing nutrition health perspective. use KD cancer shows potentially promising, inconsistent, results. limited number studies differences study design characteristics contribute overall poor quality evidence, limiting ability draw evidence-based conclusions. However, potential positive influences KD may cancer treatment justify need well-designed clinical trials better elucidate mechanisms dietary approach affects nutritional status, cancer prognosis, overall health. role registered dietitian nutritionists demonstrated crucial planning implementing KD protocols oncology research settings, also ensuring patients' adherence optimal nutritional status.
