 80 years revolutionary discoveries Otto Warburg, observed high glucose dependency, increased glycolysis lactate production regardless oxygen availability cancer cells, 'Warburg effect' returns fore neuronal cells affected Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, seems that, mild phase AD, neuronal cells "prefer" use energetically inefficient method burning glucose glycolysis, cancer, proving become resistant beta-amyloid (Abeta)-dependent apoptosis. However, late phase, AD brain cells die response Abeta toxicity, small populations neurons, exhibiting increased glucose uptake glycolytic flux, able survive resistant Abeta. draw overview metabolic shift glucose utilization oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, focusing hypothesis that, extreme attempt oppose impending death, mitochondria-whose dysfunction central role Abeta toxicity AD hallmark-are sent quiescence, likely contributing activate mechanisms resistance Abeta-dependent apoptosis. Finally, attempt turns fruitless since loss adaptive advantage afforded elevated aerobic glycolysis exacerbates pathophysiological processes associated AD, making brain susceptible Abeta-induced neurotoxicity leading cell death dementia. understanding certain nerve cells become resistant Abeta toxicity, majority dies, attractive challenge toward identification novel possible targets AD therapy.
