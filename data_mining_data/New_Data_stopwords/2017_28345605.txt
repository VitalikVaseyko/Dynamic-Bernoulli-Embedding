 Reelin extracellular matrix protein crucial neuron migration, adhesion, positioning. examined expression Reelin large cohort multiple myeloma patients recorded Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database used over-expression siRNA knockdown Reelin investigate role Reelin myeloma cell growth. find Reelin expression negatively associated myeloma prognosis. Reelin promotes myeloma cell proliferation vitro well vivo. Warburg effect, evidenced increased glucose uptake lactate production, also enhanced Reelin-expressing cells. activation FAK/Syk/Akt/mTOR STAT3 pathways contributes Reelin-induced cancer cell growth metabolic reprogramming. findings reveal activated Akt STAT3 pathways induce upregulation HIF1alpha downstream targets (LDHA PDK1), leading increased glycolysis myeloma cells. Together, results demonstrate critical contributions Reelin myeloma growth metabolism. presents opportunity myeloma therapeutic intervention inhibiting Reelin signaling pathways.
