 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays key role tumor metabolism regulates rate-limiting final step glycolysis. tumor cells, two allosteric effectors PKM2: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) serine. However, relationship FBP serine allosteric regulation PKM2 unknown. constructed residue/residue fluctuation correlation network based all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal regulation mechanism. results suggest correlation network bound PKM2 distinctly different free state, FBP/PKM2, Ser/PKM2. community network analysis indicates information freely transfer allosteric sites FBP serine substrate site bound PKM2, exists bottleneck information transfer network free state. Furthermore, binding free energy substrate PKM2 bound PKM2 significantly lower either FBP/PKM2 Ser/PKM2. Thus, hypothesis "synergistic allosteric mechanism" proposed allosteric regulation FBP serine. hypothesis confirmed perturbational mutational analyses community networks binding free energies. Finally, two possible synergistic allosteric pathways FBP-K433-T459-R461-A109-V71-R73-MG2-OXL Ser-I47-C49-R73-MG2-OXL identified based shortest path algorithm confirmed network perturbation analysis. Interestingly, similar pathways could found free state. process targeting allosteric pathways better regulate glycolysis PKM2 significantly inhibit progression tumor.
