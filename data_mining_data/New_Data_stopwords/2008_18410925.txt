 Enhanced glycolysis observed cancerous cells tissues, called Warburg effect. Recent advance senescent biology implicates metabolic shift enhanced glycolysis would involved early stage multi-step tumorigenesis vivo. Enhanced glycolysis essential step immortalization transformation, renders cells resistant oxidative stress adaptive hypoxic condition, respectively. ES, immortalized primary, cancerous cells display common concerted metabolic shift, including enhanced glycolysis reduced mitochondrial respiration poorly characterized mechanism. Discovery novel regulatory mechanism metabolic shift might essential future development cancer diagnosis anti-cancer therapy.
