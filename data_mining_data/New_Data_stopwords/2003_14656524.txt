 describe method detection quantification nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK). NDPK catalyzes transfer gamma-phosphate cytidine 5'-triphosphate uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP) produce uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP). method uses nonradioactive coupled enzyme assay UTP produced NDPK utilized UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. latter enzyme synthesizes UDP-glucose inorganic phosphate presence glucose 1-phosphate. UDP-glucose detected 260 nm separation reaction mixture high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) strong anion-exchange column. assay reliable, specific, linear respect time enzyme amount. Using 15 min incubation time, method allows detection NDPK activity 10 pmol/min. used analyze kinetic behavior quantify NDPK wide variety animal, microbial, plant sources. also provides alternative radiometric assays improvement pyruvate kinase-linked spectrophotometric assays, hampered pigments present crude extracts. Furthermore, show HPLC method developed directly used assay enzymes UDP-glucose product.
