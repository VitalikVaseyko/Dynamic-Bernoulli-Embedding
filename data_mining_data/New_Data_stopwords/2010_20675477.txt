 Nitrogen fixation legume bacteroids energized metabolism dicarboxylic acids, requires oxidation oxaloacetate pyruvate. alfalfa bacteroids, production pyruvate requires NAD+ malic enzyme (Dme) NADP+ malic enzyme (Tme). However, show Rhizobium leguminosarum two pathways pyruvate formation dicarboxylates catalyzed Dme combined activities phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase (PckA) pyruvate kinase (PykA). pathways enable N2 fixation, PckA/PykA pathway supports N2 fixation 60% Dme. Double mutants dme pckA/pykA fix N2. Furthermore, dme pykA double mutants grow dicarboxylates, showing pathways production pyruvate dicarboxylates normally expressed. PckA expressed alfalfa bacteroids, resulting obligate requirement Dme pyruvate formation N2 fixation. PckA expressed constitutive nptII promoter alfalfa dme bacteroids, acetylene reduced 30% wild-type rate, although level insufficient prevent nitrogen starvation. Dme N-terminal, malic enzyme (Me), C-terminal phosphotransacetylase (Pta) domains. Deleting Pta domain increased peak acetylene reduction rate 4-week-old pea plants 140 150% wild-type rate, accompanied increased nodule mass. Plants infected Pta deletion mutants increased dry weight, demonstrating sustained change nitrogen fixation throughout growth. indicates complex relationship pyruvate synthesis bacteroids, nitrogen fixation, plant growth.
