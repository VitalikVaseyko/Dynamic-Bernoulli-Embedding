 objective present study characterize metabolism Clostridium thermolacticum, thermophilic anaerobic bacterium, growing continuously lactose (10 g l(-1)) determine enzymes involved pathways leading formation fermentation products. Biomass metabolites concentration measured steady-state different dilution rates, 0.013 0.19 h(-1). Acetate, ethanol, hydrogen carbon dioxide produced dilution rates, whereas lactate detected dilution rates 0.06 h(-1). presence several key enzymes involved lactose metabolism, including beta-galactosidase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, acetate kinase, ethanol dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase, demonstrated. Finally, intracellular level NADH, NAD+, ATP ADP also measured different dilution rates. production ethanol lactate appeared linked re-oxidation NADH produced glycolysis, whereas hydrogen produced come reduced ferredoxin generated pyruvate decarboxylation. produce hydrogen acetate lactose, thus appears efficient H2 removal system used, based physical (membrane) biological approach, respectively, cultivating C. thermolacticum efficient H2 scavenging acetate producing microorganisms.
