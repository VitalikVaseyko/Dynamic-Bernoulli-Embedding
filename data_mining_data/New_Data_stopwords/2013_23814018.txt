 High-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) useful treatment aggressive forms chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, mechanism action well understood, resistance GCs inevitable. minimal, serum-free culture system, synthetic GC dexamethasone (DEX) found decrease metabolic activity CLL cells, indicated down-regulation pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression activity, decreased levels pyruvate metabolites, loss mitochondrial membrane potential. metabolic restriction associated decreased size death tumor cells population. Concomitant plasma membrane damage increased killing CLL cells DEX. However, nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), regulates fatty acid oxidation, also increased DEX, adipocyte-derived lipids, lipoproteins, propionic acid protected CLL cells DEX. PPARalpha fatty acid oxidation enzyme inhibitors increased DEX-mediated killing CLL cells vitro clearance CLL xenografts vivo. findings suggest GCs prevent tumor cells generating energy needed repair membrane damage, fatty acid oxidation mechanism resistance GC-mediated cytotoxicity, PPARalpha inhibition strategy improve therapeutic efficacy GCs.
