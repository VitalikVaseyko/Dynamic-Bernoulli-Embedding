 Altered energy metabolism universal property cancer cells. Hippo signaling pathway principal downstream effector YAP1 responsible tissue homeostasis including organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation. Dysregulation Hippo pathway leads activation YAP1 culminates development multiple human cancers. study, loss-of-function assay, demonstrated YAP1 contributed glycolytic phenotype breast cancer cells. Knockdown YAP1 inhibited extracellular acidification rates, glucose consumption, lactate production breast cancer cells. Moreover, YAP1 interacted TEAD1, exerted transcriptional control functional target, glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). Overexpression Glut1 restored inhibitory effects YAP1 knockdown glycolysis demonstrated glucose consumption lactate production. Suppression glycolysis deprivation glucose largely compromised oncogenic roles YAP1 cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasive potential. Taken together, data identify novel role YAP1-TEAD1 pathway cancer energy metabolism.
