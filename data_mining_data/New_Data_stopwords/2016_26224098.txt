 aim study analyze molecular mechanisms involved FSH basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) regulation lactate production rat Sertoli cells. regulation availability pyruvate, converted lactate, could mechanism utilized hormones ensure lactate supply germ cells. one hand, regulation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB) expression could result increased glycolysis, increase pyruvate availability may also result lower conversion acetyl-CoA negative regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity phosphorylation. Sertoli cell cultures obtained 20-day-old rats used. Stimulation cultures FSH bFGF showed FSH increases Pfkfb1 Pfkfb3 expression bFGF increases Pfkfb1 mRNA levels. Additionally, observed FSH-stimulated lactate production inhibited presence PFKFB3 inhibitor, revealing physiological relevance mechanism. regulation PDC, analysis pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (Pdk) expression showed FSH increases Pdk3 decreases Pdk4 mRNA levels bFGF increases expression Pdks. addition, showed bFGF increases phosphorylated PDC levels bFGF-stimulated lactate production partially inhibited presence PDK inhibitor. Altogether, results add new information regarding novel molecular mechanisms involved hormonal regulation lactate production Sertoli cells. Considering lactate essential production energy spermatocytes spermatids, mechanisms might relevant maintaining spermatogenesis male fertility.
