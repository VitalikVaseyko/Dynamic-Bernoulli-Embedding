 cell-fractionation experiments glycolytic enzymes bloodstream forms Trypanosoma brucei recovered microbody, called glycosome [Opperdoes, F. R. Borst, P. (1977) FEBS Lett. 80, 360-364]. see whether compartmentation glycolytic enzymes accompanied compartmentation metabolites pulse-labelled intact T. brucei [U-14C]glucose followed incorporation radioactivity glycolytic intermediates separated anion-exchange chromatography. kinetics incorporation provide direct evidence existence two pools glycolytic intermediates. One pool completely labelled within 15 represents 20-30% total cellular metabolites. Radioactively labelled pyruvate already produced 15 s. Since pool directly involved glycolytic flux, conclude present glycosome. second pool represents 70-80% total appears directly involved glycolysis. content equilibrates relatively slowly glycosomal pool. probably represents cytosol. Incorporation radioactivity total glycerol 3-phosphate pool rapid metabolites studied. indicates rapid mixing glycosomal cell-sap pools glycerol 3-phosphate, required extra-glycosomal oxidation glycerol 3-phosphate mitochondrial oxidase. presence 1 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, mimics anaerobiosis, trypanosome produces equimolar amounts pyruvate glycerol. Labelling glycerol glycerol 3-phosphate proceeds identical rates times specific activity glycerol less glycerol 3-phosphate. compatible earlier proposal glycerol made glycerol 3-phosphate glycerol kinase. conclude glycolysis trypanosomes takes place glycosome membrane organelle poorly permeable glycolytic intermediates.
