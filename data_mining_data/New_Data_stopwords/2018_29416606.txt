 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) common aggressive brain tumor limited therapeutic options. Glioma stem cell (GSC) thought greatly responsible glioma tumor progression drug resistance. molecular mechanisms GSC deriving recurrence drug resistance still unclear. SOX9 (sex-determining region (SRY)-box9 protein), transcription factor expressed solid tumors, reported key regulator involved maintaining cancer hallmarks including GSCs state. Previously, observed silencing SOX9 suppressed glioma cells proliferation vitro vivo. Here, found SOX9 essential GSC self-renewal. Silencing SOX9 down-regulated broad range stem cell markers inhibited glioma cell colony sphere formation. identified pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) target gene SOX9 using microarray analyses. PDK1 inactivation greatly inhibited glioma cell colony sphere formation sensitized glioma spheres temozolomide (TMZ) toxicity. addition, SOX9-shRNA PDK1 inhibitor could greatly sensitize GSC TMZ vivo. Taken together, data reveals SOX9-PDK1 axis key regulator GSC self-renewal GSC temozolomide resistance. findings may provide help future human GBM therapy.
