 increase lactate production, activities phosphohexoisomerase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase found erythrocytes patients advanced cancer disease. Phosphofructokinase isolated patients' erythrocytes showed enhanced affinity substrate coenzyme, diminished thermal stability changed dependence activity pH. Allosteric properties enzyme modified. decrease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity observed hemolysate. partially purified enzyme showed decreased affinity glucose-6-phosphate, markedly reduced stability 45 degrees C acid alkaline pH range. Changes kinetic molecular properties two key enzymes glucose metabolism may contribute hemolysis observed many cancer patients. Incubation vitro normal human erythrocytes blood sera patients resulted increasing phosphofructokinase, decreasing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, indicating acquired enzymopathy may present cancer.
