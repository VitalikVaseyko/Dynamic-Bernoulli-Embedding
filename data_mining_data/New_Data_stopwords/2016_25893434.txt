 OBJECTIVE: explore differentially expressed proteins normal cervix, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) tissues differential proteomics technique. METHODS: Cervical tissues (including normal cervix, CIN CSCC) collected Department Gynecologic Oncology Beijing Obstetrics Gynecology Hospital. Two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) DeCyder software used detect differentially expressed proteins. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) used identify differentially expressed proteins. Western blot (WB) immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed validate expressions selected proteins among normal cervix, CIN CSCC. RESULTS: 2-D DIGE images high resolution good repeatability obtained. Forty-six differentially expressed proteins (27 up-regulated 19 down-regulated) differentially expressed among normal cervix, CIN CSCC. 26 proteins successfully identified MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. S100A9 (S100 calcium-binding protein A9) significantly up-regulated protein. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1-alpha-1 (eEF1A1) significantly down-regulated protein. Pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 (PKM2) up-regulated down-regulated. results WB showed increase severity cervical lesions, expression S100A9 protein significantly increased among three groups (P = 0.010). expression eEF1A1 reduced without significant difference (P = 0.861). expression PKM2 significantly reduced (P = 0.000). IHC showed protein S100A9 mainly expressed cytoplasm, positive expression rate 20.0 % normal cervix, 70.0 % CIN 100.0 % CSCC, significant difference among (P = 0.006). eEF1A1 mainly expressed cell plasma, positive expression rate 70.0 % normal cervix, 73.3 % CIN 60.0 % CSCC tissues, without significant difference among (P = 0.758). PKM2 mainly expressed cell nuclei, positive expression rate 100.0 % normal cervix, 93.3 % CIN 75.0 % CSCC tissues, showing difference close statistical significance (P = 0.059) among them. CONCLUSIONS: differentially expressed proteins among normal cervix, CIN CSCC. S100A9, eEF1A1 PKM2 may become candidate markers early diagnosis cervical cancer new targets therapy. also provides basis studies mechanism CIN developing CSCC.
