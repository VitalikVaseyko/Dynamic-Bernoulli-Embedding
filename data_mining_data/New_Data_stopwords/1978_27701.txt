 kinetic properties pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) extracted mycelia Neurospora crassa examined physiological pH determine role enzyme regulation glycolysis. velocity curve substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate adenosine diphosphate, hyperbolic. effect magnesium, potassium, calcium enzyme influenced pH extent would change role cofactor inhibitor. Adenosine triphosphate citrate remain strong inhibitors even changes pH. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate glucose-6-phosphate dual positive effectors physiological pH. Valine amino acid inhibits enzyme concentration range valine found mycelial juice. Thus, properties enzyme physiological pH significantly different observed neutral pH usual assay conditions, role key regulator glycolysis unchanged.
