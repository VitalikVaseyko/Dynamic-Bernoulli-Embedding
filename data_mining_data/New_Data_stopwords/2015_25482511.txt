 Metabolic regulation influences cell proliferation. influence pyruvate kinase isoforms tumor cells extensively studied, whether PKM2 required normal cell proliferation unknown. examine PKM2 deletion affects proliferation metabolism nontransformed, nonimmortalized PKM2-expressing primary cells. find deletion PKM2 primary cells results PKM1 expression proliferation arrest. PKM1 expression, rather PKM2 loss, responsible effect, proliferation arrest cannot explained cell differentiation, senescence, death, changes gene expression, prevention cell growth. Instead, PKM1 expression impairs nucleotide production ability synthesize DNA progress cell cycle. Nucleotide biosynthesis limiting, proliferation arrest characterized severe thymidine depletion, supplying exogenous thymine rescues nucleotide levels cell proliferation. Thus, PKM1 expression promotes metabolic state unable support DNA synthesis.
