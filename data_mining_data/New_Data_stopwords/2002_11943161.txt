 activity pyruvate kinase Leishmania mexicana allosterically regulated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P(2)), contrary pyruvate kinases eukaryotes usually stimulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P(2)). Based comparison three-dimensional structure Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate kinase crystallized F-1,6-P(2) present effector site (R-state) L. mexicana enzyme crystallized T-state, two residues (Lys453 His480) proposed bind 2-phospho group effector. hypothesis tested site-directed mutagenesis. allosteric activation F-2,6-P(2) appeared entirely abrogated mutated enzymes confirming predictions.
