 1. ability exogenously administered cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate) exert andromimetic action certain carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes investigated rat prostate gland seminal vesicles. 2. Cyclic AMP, injected concurrently theophylline, produced marked increases hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, two hexose monophosphate-shunt enzymes, well alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity accessory sexual tissues castrated rats. 6-N,2'-O-dibutyryl analogue cyclic AMP caused increases enzyme activity greater induced parent compound. 3. Time-course studies demonstrated that, whereas significant increases activities enzymes occurred within 4h injection cyclic AMP, maximal increases attained 16-24h. 4. Increase activity various prostatic vesicular enzymes dependent dose cyclic AMP; instances, 2.5mg cyclic nucleotide/rat sufficient elicit statistically significant response. 5. Administration cyclic AMP theophylline also produced stimulation enzyme activities secondary sexual tissues immature rats. 6. Cyclic AMP theophylline affect significantly enzymes studied hepatic tissue. 7. Stimulation various carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes prostate gland seminal vesicles cyclic AMP independent adrenal function. 8. Concurrent treatment actinomycin cycloheximide prevented cyclic AMP- theophylline-induced increases enzyme activities castrated adrenalectomized-castrated animals. 9. Administration single dose testosterone propionate (5.0mg/100g) castrated rats caused significant increase cyclic AMP concentration accessory sexual tissues. 10. addition, treatment theophylline potentiated effects submaximal dose testosterone (1.0mg/100g) prostatic seminal-vesicular enzymes increased exogenous cyclic AMP. 11. evidence indicates cyclic AMP may involved triggering known metabolic actions androgens secondary sexual tissues rat.
