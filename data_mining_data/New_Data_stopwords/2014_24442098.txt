 OBJECTIVES: Dichloroacetate (DCA) highly bioavailable small molecule inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, promoting glucose oxidation reversing glycolytic phenotype preclinical cancer studies. designed open-label phase II trial determine response rate, safety, tolerability oral DCA patients metastatic breast cancer advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS METHODS: trial conducted DCA 6.25 mg/kg orally twice daily previously treated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC stage IV breast cancer. Growth inhibition DCA also evaluated panel 54 NSCLC cell lines without cytotoxic chemotherapeutics (cisplatin docetaxel) normoxic hypoxic conditions. RESULTS CONCLUSIONS: normoxic conditions vitro, single-agent IC50 >2 mM evaluated cell lines. Synergy cisplatin seen cell lines hypoxic conditions. clinical trial, seven patients enrolled, study closed based safety concerns. breast cancer patient stable disease 8 weeks, quickly followed progression brain. Two patients withdrew consent within week enrollment. Two patients disease progression prior first scheduled scans. Within 1 week initiating DCA, one patient died suddenly unknown cause one experienced fatal pulmonary embolism. conclude patients previously treated advanced NSCLC benefit oral DCA. absence larger controlled trial, firm conclusions regarding association adverse events DCA unclear. development DCA patients longer life expectancy, sustained therapeutic levels achieved, potentially combination cisplatin.
