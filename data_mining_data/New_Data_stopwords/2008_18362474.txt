 BACKGROUND: Nerve growth factor (NGF) potent mediator, regulates characteristics mast cells, biological function well characterized. study aimed screen proteins associated maturation human mast cells-1 (HMC-1) mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) cultured NGF, examine functions proteins involved. METHODS: NGF (10 ng/ml) added cell culture medium every day 10 days HMC-1 twice week 5 weeks BMMCs. Granule formation determined electron microscopy May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining, TNF-alpha ELISA, expressions various proteins two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), siRNA transfection Lipofectamine 2000, expressions pyruvate kinase annexin immunoblotting. RESULTS: NGF treatment, granule formation total amounts granular mediator, TNF-alpha increased mast cells. TNF-alpha released calcium ionophore antigen/antibody reaction. Expressions pyruvate kinase annexin obtained 2-DE confirmed immunoblotting siRNA-transfected HMC-1 cells. Expressions proteins, granule formation TNF-alpha content blocked TrkA inhibitor, K252a, ERK inhibitor, PD98059, PI3 kinase inhibitors, LY294002 wortmannin. CONCLUSION: data suggest pyruvate kinase annexin expressed NGF contribute granule formation containing TNF-alpha well mediators mast cells, play major role allergic diseases via TrkA/ERK pathway.
