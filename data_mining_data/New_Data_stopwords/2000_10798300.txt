 present study, arsanical-based affinity chromatography pyruvate kinase (PK) isolation explored. p-Arsanilic acid (4-aminophenyl arsonic acid), contains arsonic acid moiety structurally similar inorganic pentavalent arsenate, conjugated Sepharose 4B via para-amino group form As(V)-Sepharose matrix. cellular proteins KB cells bound arsonic acid moieties eluted 50 mM sodium arsenate Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6). single protein band molecular mass 58 kDa shown sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. immunoblotting, amino acid sequencing enzymatic analysis, sodium arsenate-eluted 58-kDa protein demonstrated human PK (type M2). using one-step As(V)-Sepharose chromatography, PK KB cells purified 35.4-fold specific activity 153.15 U/mg protein presence 6 mM fructose-1,6-biphosphate. Although PK eluted As(V)-Sepharose column sodium arsenate, PK activity apparently inhibited used eluent system, p-arsanilic acid, indicating specific interaction As(V) PK. summary, results indicate As(V)-Sepharose serve simple efficient chromatographic support PK purification KB cells.
