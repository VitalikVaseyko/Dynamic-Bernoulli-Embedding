 Two human leukemia cells K562 THP-1, breast cancer lines MCF-7 ZR-75-1, melanoma line MDA-MB-435S compared flowcytometry behaviour increasing levels 3BP. K562 THP-1 responded 3BP membrane depolarization increased ROS; MCF-7 ZR-75-1 showed decreased polarization low ROS increase; MDA-MB-435S limited depolarization ROS increase. THP-1 cells exposed range 3BP concentrations combination DCA showed increase polarization, slight ROS increase, weakened nuclear integrity. 3BP DCA show synergism, complementary destructive effects THP-1 cells. data led conclusion THP-1 cells carry functional membrane monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 3BP circumvents MCT binding enter cells independently.
