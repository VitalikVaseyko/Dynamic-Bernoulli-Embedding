 Epitope detection monocytes (EDIM) represents liquid biopsy exploiting innate immune system. Activated monocytes (macrophages) phagocytose unwanted cells/cell fragments whole body including solid tissues. return blood, macrophages used non-invasive detection biomarkers, thereby providing high sensitivity specificity, intracellular presence biomarkers due innate immune response. Flow cytometry analysis blood enables detection macrophages phagocytosed intracellular biomarkers. order establish pan-cancer test, biomarkers two fundamental biophysical mechanisms exploited. DNaseX/Apo10 protein epitope characteristic tumor cells abnormal apoptosis proliferation. Transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) marker anaerobic glucose metabolism (Warburg effect), concomitant invasive growth/metastasis resistant radical apoptosis inducing therapies. detection Apo10 TKTL1 blood macrophages allowed sensitive (95.8%) specific (97.3%) detection prostate, breast oral squamous cell carcinomas. Since TKTL1 represents drugable target, EDIM based detection TKTL1 enables targeted cancer therapy using vitamin derivatives oxythiamine benfo-oxythiamine.
