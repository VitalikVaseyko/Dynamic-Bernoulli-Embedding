 developed vitro system detailed analysis reversible phosphorylation plant mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, comprising recombinant Arabidopsis thalianaalpha2beta2-heterotetrameric pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) plus A. thaliana E1-kinase (AtPDK). Upon addition MgATP, Ser292, located within active-site loop structure E1alpha, phosphorylated. addition Ser292, Asp295 Gly297 highly conserved E1alpha active-site loop sequences. Mutation Asp295 Ala, Asn, Leu greatly reduced phosphorylation Ser292, mutation Gly297 relatively little effect. Quantitative two-hybrid analysis used show mutation Asp295 substantially affect binding AtPDK E1alpha. using pyruvate variable substrate, Asp295 mutant proteins modest changes k(cat), K(m), k(cat)/K(m) values. Therefore, propose Asp295 plays important role stabilizing active-site loop structure, facilitating transfer gamma-phosphate ATP Ser residue regulatory site one E1alpha.
