 Weanling rats fed vitamin E deficient diets 6 15 weeks given vitamin E orally 4 days. Plasma obtained 1 day last dose assayed glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) pyruvate kinase activity (PK). Administration vitamin E resulted reduction activity enzymes. Plasma levels alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, bilirubin unaffected vitamin E histological evidence liver degeneration. number phagocytized muscle fibers greatly reduced vitamin E treatment, substantial number necrotic fibers still present. prolonged (8 days) treatment, plasma PK GOT levels reduced levels found plasma vitamin E replete animals degenerated muscle fibers could observed. concluded resolution necrotizing myopathy vitamin E deficient rats rapid process decreased activity PK GOT plasma sensitive indicator resolution process. decrease plasma enzyme levels easily quantitated reproducible biological response vitamin E administration. Thus, approach provides basis sensitive accurate bioassay vitamin E activity.
