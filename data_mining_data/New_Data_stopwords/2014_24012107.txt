 Two engineered Escherichia coli strains, designated VH33 VH34, compared parent strain W3110 chemostat mode plasmid DNA (pDNA) production. strain VH33 glucose uptake system modified aim reducing overflow metabolism. strain VH34 additional deletion pyruvate kinase gene (pykA) increase pDNA formation. pDNA formation rates well kinetic stoichiometric parameters investigated dependence growth rate within range 0.02 0.25 h(-1). Differences strains found terms biomass yields nitrogen oxygen, well cell maintenance coefficients. deletion pykA led significantly increased pDNA yield productivity. optimal growth rate 0.20 h(-1) nearly 60% higher W3110 VH33. Metabolic fluxes calculated metabolite balance analysis showed differences mainly reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. obtained data useful design cultivation schemes pDNA production E. coli.
