 identification two genes encoding polypeptides structural features common estrogen receptor quarter century ago, referred estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), subsequently led discovery several previously unrecognized hormone responsive systems application reverse endocrinology. Paradoxically, natural ligand(s) associated members ERR subfamily remains identified. initial studies mode action physiological functions ERRs focused interaction estrogen signalling breast cancer, subsequent work showed ERRs ubiquitous master regulators cellular energy metabolism. review aims demonstrate ERRs occupy central node interface cancer metabolism, modulation activity may represent worthwhile strategy induce metabolic vulnerability tumors various origins thus achieve comprehensive response current therapies.
