 Epidemiological biochemical studies show sporadic forms Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized following hallmarks: (a) exponential increase age; (b) Selective neuronal vulnerability; (c) Inverse cancer comorbidity. present article appeals hallmarks evaluate contrast two competing models AD: amyloid hypothesis (a neuron-centric mechanism) Inverse Warburg hypothesis (a neuron-astrocytic mechanism). show three hallmarks AD conflict amyloid hypothesis, consistent Inverse Warburg hypothesis, bioenergetic model postulates AD result cascade three events-mitochondrial dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming (the Inverse Warburg effect), natural selection. also provide explanation failures clinical trials based amyloid immunization, propose new class therapeutic strategies consistent neuroenergetic selection model.
