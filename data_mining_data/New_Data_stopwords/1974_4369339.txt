 new method described preparation pyruvate kinase yeast. eliminates proteolysis preparation. molecular weight yeast pyruvate kinase 215000, composed four subunits. properties enzyme extinction coefficient, cold-lability, thiol-group reactivity binding Mn(2+) ions compared previously reported yeast pyruvate kinase prepared different methods. specific activity significantly higher previously observed, otherwise enzyme similar, apart molecular weight Mn(2+)-binding characteristics, preparations Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained laboratory (e.g. Fell et al., 1972, references therein) C. H. Suelter (e.g. Kuczenski & Suelter, 1971, references therein), different enzyme isolated Saccharomyces carlsbergensis B. Hess co-workers (e.g. Wieker & Hess, 1972, references therein).
