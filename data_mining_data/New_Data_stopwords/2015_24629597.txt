 present study designed evaluate antihyperglycemic potential tangeretin activities key enzymes carbohydrate glycogen metabolism control streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. daily oral administration tangeretin (100mg/kg body weight) diabetic rats 30 days resulted significant reduction levels plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) increase levels insulin hemoglobin. altered activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase liver diabetic rats significantly reverted near normal levels administration tangeretin. Further, tangeretin administration diabetic rats improved hepatic glycogen content suggesting antihyperglycemic potential tangeretin diabetic rats. effect produced tangeretin various parameters comparable glibenclamide - standard oral hypoglycemic drug. Thus, results show tangeretin modulates activities hepatic enzymes via enhanced secretion insulin decreases blood glucose streptozotocin induced diabetic rats antioxidant potential.
