 Tumor stroma recently shown play crucial role development breast cancer. Since origin stromal cells tumor unknown, examined differences similarities three stromal cell types mesenchymal origin, namely carcinoma associated fibroblasts breast tumor (CAFs), fibroblasts normal breast area (NFs) bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). microarray analysis, immunological, developmental extracellular matrix -related pathways over-represented CAFs compared NFs (p<0.001). hypoxic conditions, expression levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) lower CAFs compared NFs (fold changes 0.6 0.4, respectively). normoxia, compared NFs, CAFs displayed increased expression glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) PDK1 (fold changes 1.5 1.3, respectively). respect assessed surface markers, CD105 expressed differently MSCs compared fibroblasts, often expressed MSCs. Cells myofibroblast features present NF CAF samples. conclude, CAFs differ distinctly NFs gene expression level, hypothesis also tested silico available gene expression data.
