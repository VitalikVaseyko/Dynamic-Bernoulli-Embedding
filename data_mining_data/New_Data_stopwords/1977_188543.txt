 relationships among properties pyruvate kinase isozymes reviewed, emphasizing potential role carcinogenesis. Particular consideration given evaluation concept three major nonreadily interconvertible forms products distinct genes, relationship forms additional separable forms pyruvate kinase, types possible functions interconvertible forms major isozymes, mechanisms affecting genetic expression isozymes. Emphasis placed upon apparent derepression fetal isozyme hepatomas influence neoplasms extracts expression pyruvate kinase liver host animals.
