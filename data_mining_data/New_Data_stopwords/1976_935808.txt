 Two patients mild chronic haemolytic anaemia, mother son, found heterozygous erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. red blood cells enzymatic activity reduced 50% residual PK normal kinetic properties, stability electrofocusing pattern. PK antigen concentration also decreased half, ratio enzymatic activity immunological reactivity (i.e. molecular specific activity) normal. son's liver PK enzymatic activity slightly reduced and, all, abnormal active form, anodic normal PK, detected electrofocusing. propositus's liver PK also slightly thermo-unstable. suggested patients heterozygous unstable PK variant found liver, nucleated tissue actively synthesizing proteins, disappeared erythrocytes unstability.
