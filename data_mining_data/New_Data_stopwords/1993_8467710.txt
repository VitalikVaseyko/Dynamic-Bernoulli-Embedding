 Analysis F2 intercross progeny inbred F344/N x LEW/N rats led assignment 10 polymorphic PCR-typable markers rat chromosome 2. markers form single linkage group covering 47.9 cM following order: D2N1R-D2N28-FGG (gamma fibrinogen)-PKLR (liver RBC pyruvate kinase)-ATP1A1 (the alpha-1 polypeptide Na+/K+ transporting ATPase)-HSD3B (hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase)-D2N2R-D2N91-CAMKI (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II)-D2N35. two markers (D2N1R D2N2R) detected using specific PCR primers flanking dinucleotide repeats. Sequences dinucleotide repeats associated five genes (FGG, PKLR, ATP1A1, HSD3B, CAMKI) identified GenBank, primers designed flank repeats. PCR primer pairs three anonymous markers (D2N28, D2N91, D2N35) identified sequencing cloned LEW/N rat genomic DNA containing (CA)n.(GT)n repeats. D2N1R D2N2R identified PCR amplification genomic DNA single, nonspecific 10-base oligonucleotide primers. markers codominant except D2N1R, D2N2R, CAMKI, amplified F344/N homozygous heterozygous rat DNA. seven codominant markers highly polymorphic 10 inbred rat strains (SHR/N, WKY/N, MNR/N, MR/N, LOU/MN, BN/SsN, BUF/N, WBB1/N, WBB2/N, ACI/N), suggesting useful general mapping studies among strains. Comparative gene mapping analysis indicated portion mapped region rat chromosome 2 exhibits synteny conservation regions human chromosome 1 mouse Chromosome 3.
