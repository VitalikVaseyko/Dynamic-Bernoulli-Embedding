 Hypobaric hypoxia induces right ventricular hypertrophy. relative contribution pulmonary hypertension, decreased arterial oxygen, neuroendocrine stimulation transcriptional profile hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy unknown. Whereas ventricles exposed hypoxia neuroendocrine stimulation, right ventricle exposed increased load. postulated right ventricular hypertrophy would reactivate fetal gene transcriptional profile response increased load. measured expression candidate genes right ventricle rats exposed hypobaric hypoxia (11% O(2)) compared results left ventricle. Hypoxia induced right ventricular hypertrophy without fibrosis. right ventricle only, atrial natriuretic factor transcript levels progressively increased starting day 7. Metabolic genes differentially regulated, suggesting substrate switch fatty acids glucose early hypoxia switch back fatty acids day 14. also switch myosin isogene expression downregulation sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic ATPase 2a early hypoxia, whereas later, myosin isoforms SERCA2a upregulated. right left ventricle compared, transcript levels genes, except myosin isoforms pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, differed dramatically suggesting genes regulated load. findings demonstrate hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy transiently reactivates fetal gene program. Furthermore, myosin iso-gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 expression affected load, suggesting either hypoxia neuroendocrine stimulation primary regulator genes.
