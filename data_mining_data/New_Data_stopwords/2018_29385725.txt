 Cancers exhibit Warburg effect may elevate expression glyoxylase 1 (GLO1) detoxify toxic glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal (MG) inhibit formation pro-apoptotic advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Inhibition GLO1 cancers up-regulate glycolysis proposed therapeutic targeting strategy, approach evaluated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), aggressive difficult treat malignancy brain. Elevated GLO1 expression GBM established patient tumors cell lines using bioinformatics tools biochemical approaches. GLO1 inhibition GBM cell lines orthotopic xenograft GBM mouse model examined using small molecule short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approaches. Inhibition GLO1 S-(p-bromobenzyl) glutathione dicyclopentyl ester (p-BrBzGSH(Cp)(2)) increased levels DNA-AGE N(2)-1-(carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (CEdG), surrogate biomarker nuclear MG exposure; substantially elevated expression immunoglobulin-like receptor AGEs (RAGE); induced apoptosis GBM cell lines. Targeting GLO1 shRNA similarly increased CEdG levels RAGE expression, cytotoxic glioma cells. Mice bearing orthotopic GBM xenografts treated systemically p-BrBzGSH(Cp)(2) exhibited tumor regression without significant off-target effects suggesting GLO1 inhibition may value therapeutic management drug-resistant tumors.
