 Recent advances hereditary disorders red cell enzymes Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway Rapoport-Leubering cycle discussed stress pyruvate kinase deficiency, common intensively studied disorder among them. Broad genetic heterogeneity exists known erythroenzymopathies. Recently, primary structure normal human red cell phosphoglycerate kinase determined single amino acid substitutions four mutant phosphoglycerate kinases clarified Yoshida et al. studies allowed analysis structure-function relationships molecular level carried precisely previously possible. consensus investigators working field pathogenesis three-quarters congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia patients remains unknown even adequate red cell enzyme studies isopropanol test unstable hemoglobin done. simply means much studies remain worked field.
