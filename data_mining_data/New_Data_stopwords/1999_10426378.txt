 Regulation activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex skeletal muscle plays important role fuel selection glucose homeostasis. Activation complex promotes disposal glucose, whereas inactivation conserves substrates hepatic glucose production. Starvation diabetes induce stable increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity skeletal muscle mitochondria promotes phosphorylation inactivation complex. present study shows metabolic conditions induce large increase expression PDK4, one four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzymes expressed mammalian tissues, mitochondria gastrocnemius muscle. Refeeding starved rats insulin treatment diabetic rats decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity also reversed increase PDK4 protein gastrocnemius muscle mitochondria. Starvation diabetes also increased abundance PDK4 mRNA gastrocnemius muscle, refeeding insulin treatment reversed effects starvation diabetes. findings suggest increase amount enzyme contributes hyperphosphorylation inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex metabolic conditions. found feeding rats WY-14,643, selective agonist peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), also induced large increases pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity, PDK4 protein, PDK4 mRNA gastrocnemius muscle. Since long-chain fatty acids activate PPAR-alpha endogenously, increased levels compounds starvation diabetes may signal increased expression PDK4 skeletal muscle.
