 Betulin wide range biological pharmacological properties anticancer activity attracting attention offers possible alternative treatment chemotherapy. However, betulin's vivo biological effectiveness limited poor solubility. such, synthesized polar glycosylated derivatives increase hydrosolubility enhance pharmacological properties. Among synthesized compounds, 28-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranosylbetulin 3beta-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (Bi-L-RhamBet) assessed cytotoxic effects suite lung cancer cell lines. also investigated mechanism action using A549 lung cancer cell line. results showed Bi-L-RhamBet exhibited potent cytotoxic activity toward lung cancer cell lines including A549, NCI-H2087, NCI-H522, NCI-H1993 NCI-H1755, LLC1 IC50 values ranging 2.9 5.9 muM. Moreover, Bi-L-RhamBet (50 mg/kg) significantly inhibited tumor growth treatment-to-control ratio (T/C) 0.54 tumor growth inhibition rate 46% day 18 (p < 0.05). Microscopic observations A549 cells, double stained acridine orange ethidium bromide, showed apoptotic features. Bi-L-RhamBet induced activation pro-apoptotic caspases 8, 9, 3/7 well causing DNA fragmentation. Moreover, marked increase mitochondrial ROS (mROS) coupled reduction mitochondrial potential. Interestingly, presence mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors, including rotenone, malonate, antimycin A, reduced mROS production, activation caspases suggesting Bi-L-RhamBet disturbs ETC. Finally, dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor potentiated cytotoxicity Bi-L-RhamBet A549 cells. Taken together, data suggest Bi-L-RhamBet induce apoptotic cell death via disturbance mitochondrial electron transfer chain, reduced ROS production, decreased membrane potential.
