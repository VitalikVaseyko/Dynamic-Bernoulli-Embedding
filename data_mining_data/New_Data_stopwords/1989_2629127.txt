 Hereditary spherocytosis still difficult diagnose situations due existence subclinical expressions lack accurate test high sensitivity specificity. Recently, Vettore et al. described so-called 'Pink test' easy method highest reproducibility sensitivity. Herein, present experience 'Pink test' diagnosis 16 previously diagnosed hereditary spherocytosis patients comparing results obtained 96 healthy controls, 41 beta-thalassaemias, 9 autoimmune haemolytic anaemias, 8 chronic hemoproliferative syndromes 2 patients pyruvate kinase deficiency. also present modification original 'Pink test' small sample blood (200 microL) obtained finger-prick (or heel puncture newborns infants) mixed hemolyzing solution 'Pink test' within first three hours blood drawing. Elevated correlation coefficients (r = 0.75-0.96) methods obtained comparing percentage final haemolysis 25 healthy controls, 21 beta-thalassaemia minor 9 hereditary spherocytosis patients.
