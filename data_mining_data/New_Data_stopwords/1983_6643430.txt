 effect ODC-factor, partially purified ascites fluid mice bearing Ehrlich ascites hepatoma, DNA synthesis normal mouse liver spleen studied, target cells factor liver examined. DNA synthesis liver increased 4-fold basal level 39-42 h increase ODC activity induced injection factor normal mice. increase DNA synthesis inhibited repeated injection DAPol. inhibition completely reversed administration appropriate amount putrescine time. TK activity also increased parallel DNA synthesis. Normal mice without treatment factor used examine cell population liver real target factor. livers dispersed three cell populations (heavy, medium, light) separated centrifugation. heavy light cell populations characterized mature hepatocytes cell population consisting mainly immature hepatocytes non-hepatocytes analysis marker enzymes, pyruvate kinase isozymes, L M2, respectively. factor stimulated ODC induction, concomitant increases TK DNA poly activities DNA synthesis, effectively light cell fraction followed order medium heavy fractions. nutritional factor (a high protein diet), potent inducer liver ODC, appeared act liver different way ODC-factor, judging results studies whole liver fractionated cell system described above. Autoradiography [3H]thymidine incorporation liver cells showed DNA synthesis mature hepatocytes well nonhepatocytes enhanced injection factor. Stimulation non-hepatocytes seems suggestive evidence immunologic response mice might developed factor. fact, ODC activity, DNA synthesis, DNA poly activity (but TK) spleen significantly increased response factor increments suppressed DAPol, though less sensitively light cell fraction liver.
