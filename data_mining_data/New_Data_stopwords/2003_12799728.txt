 purpose study evaluate effects dichloroacetate sodium (DCA), drug inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH-K), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, lactate level, function skeletal muscle experimental model acute limb ischemia. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent right iliac artery ligation produce hindlimb ischemia. 2 hours ischemia, 16 animals received intravenous DCA (15 mg/100 g body weight) 16 control animals received equivalent volume normal saline. additional 1 hour ischemia (total 3 hours) tibialis anterior muscle ischemic limb contralateral nonischemic limb excised, rapidly freeze-clamped Wallenberg tongs cooled liquid nitrogen, stored -70 degrees C. Muscles specimens subsequently assayed PDH activity lactate level use spectrophotometric techniques. additional 16 animals (DCA-treated, n = 8; control, n = 8) underwent ex-vivo gastrocnemius muscle fatigue testing 10 g tension preload 3 hours limb ischemia. ischemic hind limbs, DCA treatment significantly (p = 0.025) increased PDH activity (19.6 +/-1.6 micromol/min/g dry weight) compared controls (13.1 +/-1.3 micromol/min/g dry weight). DCA treatment increase (p = 0.13) skeletal muscle PDH activity nonischemic limbs (9.6 +/-1.1 micromol/min/g dry weight, controls; 13.2 +/-1.3 micromol/min/g dry weight, DCA group). DCA-treated animals, hind limb ischemia resulted significant increase muscle lactate levels compared nonischemic limb, control animals demonstrated significant (p = 0.005) elevation lactate level ischemic limbs compared contralateral nonischemic limb. Ischemia induced significant decrease time muscle fatigue DCA-treated control animals (p = 0.002 0.001, respectively). Time muscle fatigue DCA-treated animals increased compared controls (2.6 +/-0.3 versus 2 +/-0.6 minutes; p < 0.05)in ischemic limbs significantly different nonischemic limbs (DCA = 3.3 +/-0.5 minutes; control = 3.1 +/-0.6 minutes). Treatment DCA acute limb ischemia reduced depression PDH activity lactate level skeletal muscle. Ischemic muscle function also improved DCA treatment. investigation potential beneficial effects DCA treatment muscle injury ischemia reperfusion warranted.
