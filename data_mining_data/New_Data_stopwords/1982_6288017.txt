 method devised purify branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase (BCOAD) rat kidney retains endogenous kinase activity. Incorporation 32P purified enzyme parallels time course enzyme inhibition ATP. Phosphorylation occurs serine residue(s) 46000-mol.wt. subunit enzyme complex. Endogenous phosphatase activity present purification, added pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase re-activate BCOAD liberate 32P previously labelled enzyme. results demonstrate BCOAD regulated endogenous protein kinase phosphorylation-cycle enzymes regulating BCOAD appear distinct associated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
