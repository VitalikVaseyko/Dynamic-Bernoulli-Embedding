 2-[18O]phosphorothioate D-glycerate, chiral phosphorus, prepared. chiral phosphoryl group transferred enzymically ADP [by using enolase pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.40)] resulting synthesis adenosine 5'-O-([gamma-18O],gamma-thio)triphosphate. labeled ATP used thiophosphoryl group donor reactions catalyzed glycerol kinase (ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.30) hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.1). product latter (glucose 6-phosphorothioate) converted enzymically glycerol phosphorothioate. Determination relative configurations diastereoisomeric purities samples glycerol phosphorothioate demonstrates three phosphokinases (pyruvate kinase, glycerol kinase, hexokinase) transfer thiophosphoryl group complete stereospecificity, shows reactions follow identical stereochemical course.
