 Male C57BL/6 X C3H/anf F1 mice either untreated fed 3,5-dichloro(N-1, 1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)benzamide, chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide, 12, 18 24 months. Mice highest dose group showed evidence chronic liver toxicity including necrosis increased incidence tumors diagnosed malignant histological assessment. increase malignant tumors accompanied increased mortality. Glucose-6-phosphatase alkaline phosphatase good markers mouse hepatic nodules. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase good marker irregularly present lesions. Nodules also relative decrease aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity increase K form glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase. Treatment type, well nodular morphology, effect enzyme activity case markers.
