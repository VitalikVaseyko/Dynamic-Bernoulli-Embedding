 Effects prolactin (PRL), bromocriptine (Br), testosterone propionate (TP), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) combinations androgens PRL/Br specific activities caudal cranial prostatic cellular enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism castrated mature bonnet monkeys studied. Castration decreased enzymes studied hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3-PD), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) cranial caudal prostates. PRL elevated activities enzymes normal except G-3-PD cranial lobe. caudal lobe, PRL brought back activities HK, PFK, PK, G-6-PD normal 6-PGD normal except G-3-PD. TP/DHT treatment increased enzymes lobes. PRL given along TP/DHT enhanced androgen action regard HK, PK, G-6-PD 6-PGD cranial PFK, G-3-PD, PK, G-6-PD 6-PGD caudal lobe. Br treatment produce alteration enzymes lobes. cranial lobe, Br+TP/DHT treatment, stimulating effects androgen unaffected enzymes except PK. hand caudal, stimulatory effects androgens affected activities HK, PFK, PK 6-PGD significantly decreased. present results suggest PRL direct well synergistic action androgens enzymes EMP HMP shunt prostates monkeys.
