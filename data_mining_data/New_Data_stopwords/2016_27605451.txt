 Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 (sFRP2) plays key role chronic fibrosis myocardial infarction heart failure. aim study elucidate mechanisms sFRP2 may regulate growth extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). found sFRP2 activates CFs part canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, evidenced increased expression Axin2 Wnt3a, Wnt5a, well accumulation nuclear beta-catenin. response sFRP2, CFs exhibited robust cell proliferation associated increased glucose consumption lactate production, phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect" oncology. coupling CF expansion anaerobic glycolysis marked upregulation glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. conjunction phenotypic changes, CFs accelerated ECM remodeling upregulation expression matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 MMP13 genes, two members collagenase subfamily, enzyme activities MMP2 MMP9, two members gelatinase subfamily. Consistent induction multiple MMPs possessing collagenolytic activities, steady-state level collagen type 1 CF-spent medium reduced sFRP2. Analysis non-CF cell types revealed multifaceted effects sFRP2 growth control, glucose metabolism, ECM regulation largely restricted CFs highly sensitive Wnt signaling perturbation. study provides molecular framework functional versatility signaling complexity sFRP2 cardiac fibrosis may better defined.
