 Glucose metabolic reprogramming hallmark cancer. Cancer cells rapidly adjust energy source oxidative phosphorylation glycolytic metabolism order efficiently proliferate hypoxic environment, mechanism underlying switch still incompletely understood. Here, report hypoxia potently induces RNA-binding protein HuR specifically bind primary miR-199a transcript block miR-199a maturation hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. demonstrate hypoxia-suppressed miR-199a plays decisive role limiting glycolysis HCC cells targeting hexokinase-2 (Hk2) pyruvate kinase-M2 (Pkm2). Furthermore, systemically delivered cholesterol-modified agomiR-199a inhibits [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake attenuates tumor growth HCC tumor-bearing mice. data reveal novel mechanism reprogramming cancer energy metabolism HuR suppresses miR-199a maturation link hypoxia Warburg effect suggest promising therapeutic strategy targets miR-199a interrupt cancerous aerobic glycolysis.
