 BACKGROUND & AIMS: pathogenesis cirrhosis, disabling outcome defective liver repair, involves deregulated accumulation myofibroblasts derived quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), mechanisms control transdifferentiation HSCs poorly understood. investigated whether Hedgehog (Hh) pathway controls fate HSCs regulating metabolism. METHODS: Microarray, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot analyses used identify metabolic genes differentially expressed quiescent vs myofibroblast HSCs. Glycolysis lactate production disrupted HSCs determine metabolism influenced transdifferentiation. Hh signaling hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) activity altered identify factors alter glycolytic activity. Changes expression genes regulate glycolysis quantified localized biopsy samples patients cirrhosis liver samples mice following administration CCl(4) bile duct ligation. Mice given systemic inhibitors Hh determine affect glycolytic activity hepatic stroma; Hh signaling also conditionally disrupted myofibroblasts determine effects glycolytic activity. RESULTS: Transdifferentiation cultured, quiescent HSCs myofibroblasts induced glycolysis caused lactate accumulation. Increased expression genes regulate glycolysis required Hh signaling involved induction HIF1alpha. Inhibitors Hh signaling, HIF1alpha, glycolysis, lactate accumulation converted myofibroblasts quiescent HSCs. diseased livers animals patients, numbers glycolytic stromal cells associated severity fibrosis. Conditional disruption Hh signaling myofibroblasts reduced numbers glycolytic myofibroblasts liver fibrosis mice; similar effects observed following administration pharmacologic inhibitors Hh. CONCLUSIONS: Hedgehog signaling controls fate HSCs regulating metabolism. findings might applied diagnosis treatment patients cirrhosis.
