 Genomic characterization medulloblastoma improved molecular risk classification struggles define functional biological processes, particularly aggressive subgroups. present novel proteomic approach problem using reference library stable isotope labeled medulloblastoma-specific proteins spike-in standard accurate quantification tumor proteome. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, quantified tumor proteome group 3 medulloblastoma cells demonstrate high-risk MYC amplified tumors segregated based protein expression patterns. cross-validated differentially expressed protein candidates using independent transcriptomic data set confirmed separate cohort medulloblastoma tissue samples identify robust proteogenomic differences. Interestingly, highly expressed proteins associated MYC-amplified tumors significantly related glycolytic metabolic pathways via alternative splicing pyruvate kinase (PKM) heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs). Furthermore, maintained hypoxic conditions, MYC-amplified tumors demonstrated increased viability compared non-amplified tumors within subgroup. Taken together, findings highlight power proteomics integrative platform help prioritize genetic molecular drivers cancer biology behavior.
