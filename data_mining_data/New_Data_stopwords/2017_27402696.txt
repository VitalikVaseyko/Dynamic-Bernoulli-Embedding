 vitamin metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces gut-homing phenotype activated CD4(+) conventional cells (Tconv) upregulating integrin alpha4beta7 chemokine receptor CCR9. report that, contrast mouse Tconv, approximately 50% regulatory cells (Treg) upregulate CCR9 stimulated physiological levels ATRA, even though Tconv Treg express similar levels retinoic acid receptor (RAR). resulting bimodal CCR9 expression associated differences extent proliferation, level Foxp3 expression, affiliation naturally occurring Treg induced Treg circulating Treg pool. Furthermore, find exposure Treg mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin suppresses upregulation CCR9 alpha4beta7, effect evident Tconv. suggests Treg, ATRA-induced upregulation CCR9 alpha4beta7 dependent activation mTOR signaling pathway. involvement mTOR independent Akt activity, specific inhibition Akt, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, downstream target glycogen synthase kinase-3 prevent CCR9 expression. Additionally, Rictor (mTOR complex [mTORC]2)-deficient Treg showed unaltered ability express CCR9, whereas Raptor (mTORC1)-deficient Treg unable upregulate CCR9, suggesting selective participation mTORC1. findings reveal novel difference ATRA signaling chemokine receptor induction Treg versus Tconv provide framework via migratory behavior Treg versus Tconv might regulated differentially therapeutic purposes.
