 p-Synephrine one main active components fruit Citrus aurantium (bitter orange). Extracts bitter orange preparations containing p-synephrine used worldwide promote weight loss sports performance. purpose study measure action p-synephrine hepatic enzyme activities linked carbohydrate energy metabolism levels adenine mononucleotides. Enzymes adenine mononucleotides measured isolated perfused rat liver vivo oral administration drug (50 300 mg/kg) using standard techniques. p-Synephrine increased activity glycogen phosphorylase vivo perfused liver. decreased, however, activities pyruvate kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase also vivo perfused liver. p-Synephrine increased hepatic pools adenosine diphosphate adenosine triphosphate. Stimulation glycogen phosphorylase consistent reported increased glycogenolysis perfused liver increased glycemia rats. decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indicates p-synephrine potentially capable inhibiting transformation carbohydrates lipids. capability increasing adenosine triphosphate-adenosine diphosphate pool indicates beneficial effect p-synephrine cellular energetics.
