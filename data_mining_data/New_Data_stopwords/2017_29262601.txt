 JAK-2 dysregulation plays important role oncogenic driver, thus promising therapeutic target hematological malignancies. Ruxolitinib pyrrolo[2.3-d]pyrimidine derivative inhibitory activity JAK1 JAK2, moderate activity TYK2, minor activity JAK3. Vorinostat HDAC inhibitor reduces JAK-2 expression, thus affecting JAK-2 mRNA expression increasing JAK-2 proteasomal deterioration. hypothesized combination ruxolitinib vorinostat could synergistic effects hematological disease. tested combinations low doses ruxolitinib vorinostat 12 cell lines, observed highly synergistic cytotoxic action six cell lines, maintained 120 h presence stromal cells. sensitivity six cell lines may explained broad effects drug combination, affect various targets. Treatment combination ruxolitinib vorinostat appeared induce possible reversal Warburg effect, associated ROS production, apoptotic events, growth inhibition. Decreased glucose metabolism may markedly sensitized six susceptible cell lines combined treatment. Therapeutic inhibition JAK/STAT pathway seems offer substantial anti-tumor benefit, combined therapy ruxolitinib vorinostat may represent promising novel therapeutic modality hematological neoplasms.
