 Pectobacterium spp. among devastating necrotrophs, attacking 50% angiosperm plant orders. virulence strategy based mainly secretion exoenzymes degrade cell walls hosts, providing nutrients bacteria, conversely, exposing bacteria plant defense compounds. present study, screened plant-derived antimicrobial compounds, mainly phenolic acids polyphenols, ability affect virulence determinants including motility, biofilm formation extracellular enzyme activities different Pectobacteria: Pectobacterium carotovorum, P. brasiliensis, P. atrosepticum P. aroidearum. addition, virulence assays performed three different plant hosts following exposure bacteria selected phenolic compounds. experiments showed cinnamic, coumaric, syringic salicylic acids catechol considerably reduce disease severity, ranging 20 100%. reduced disease severity result reduced bacterial growth, also direct effect compounds important bacterial virulence determinants, including pectolytic proteolytic exoenzyme activities, reduced 50-100%. first report revealing direct effect phenolic compounds virulence factors wide range Pectobacterium strains.
