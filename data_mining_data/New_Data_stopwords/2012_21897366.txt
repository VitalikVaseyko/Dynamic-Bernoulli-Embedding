 Obesity life-threatening factor often associated dysregulation gene expression. Here, show CNOT3 subunit CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex critical metabolic regulation. Cnot3(+/-) mice lean hepatic adipose tissues containing reduced levels lipids, show increased metabolic rates enhanced glucose tolerance. Cnot3(+/-) mice remain lean sensitive insulin even high-fat diet. Furthermore, introduction Cnot3 haplodeficiency ob/ob mice ameliorated obese phenotype. Hepatic expression mRNAs altered Cnot3(+/-) vis-a-vis wild-type mice. However, levels specific mRNAs, coding energy metabolism-related PDK4 IGFBP1, increased Cnot3(+/-) hepatocytes, poly(A) tails longer seen control cells. provide evidence CNOT3 involved recruitment CCR4-NOT deadenylase 3' end specific mRNAs. Finally, CNOT3 levels liver white adipose tissues decrease upon fasting, propose CNOT3 responds feeding conditions regulate deadenylation-specific mRNAs energy metabolism.
