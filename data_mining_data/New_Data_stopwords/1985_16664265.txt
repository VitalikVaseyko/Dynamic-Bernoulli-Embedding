 Young bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var Saxa) fed 3.5 10 millimolar N either form NO(3) (-) NH(4) (+), grown N-free nutrient solution 8 days. pH nutrient solutions either 6 4. cell sap pH extractable activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase roots primary leaves measured several days.The extractable activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (based soluble protein) primary leaves increased NO(3) (-) nutrition, whereas NH(4) (+) nutrition N-free nutrient solution activity remained low level. Phosphoenopyruvate carboxylase activity roots NH(4) (+)-fed plants pH 4 finally somewhat higher roots plants grown NO(3) (-) pH. difference activity root N treatments pH nutrient solutions 6. extractable activity pyruvate kinase roots primary leaves seemed influenced N nutrition plants.The results discussed relation physiological function enzymes special regard postulated functions phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase C3 plants anaplerotic enzyme part cellular pH stat.
