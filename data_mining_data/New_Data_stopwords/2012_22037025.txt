 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Graft dysfunction one major complications liver transplantation, precise mechanism remains unclear. Since steatotic liver grafts susceptible post-transplant dysfunction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha plays important role maintenance hepatic lipid homeostasis, examined role PPARalpha liver transplantation. METHODS: Livers harvested Sv/129 wild-type (Ppara(+/+)) mice PPARalpha-null (Ppara(-/-)) mice transplanted orthotopically syngeneic Ppara(+/+) mice. RESULTS: Hepatocellular damage unexpectedly milder transplanted Ppara(-/-) livers compared Ppara(+/+) ones. likely due decreased lipid peroxides Ppara(-/-) livers, revealed lower levels fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes, major sources reactive oxygen species. Hepatic PPARalpha target genes, FAO enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, strongly down-regulated transplantation, associated increases hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression nuclear factor-kappaB activity. Inhibiting post-transplant PPARalpha down-regulation clofibrate treatment markedly augmented oxidative stress hepatocellular injury. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation PPARalpha seemed adaptive response metabolic alterations following liver transplantation. results provide novel information understanding pathogenesis early post-transplant events.
