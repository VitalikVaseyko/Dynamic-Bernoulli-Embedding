 Rabbit sperm pyruvate kinase remains bound cell structure hypotonically treated mature rabbit epididymal spermatozoa (HTRES). displays kinetic behavior similar rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase regard KM values substrates, activation monovalent divalent cations, inhibition phenylalanine reversed alanine, lack activation fructose-1,6-biphosphate. flagellar ATPase also remains bound cell structure HTRES, whose motility may reactivated source ATP. requires Mg+2 activity; KM ATP MG+2 0.2 mM, implying MgATP substrate. ATPase activity inhibited ouabain, oligomycin, vanadate, also affect reconstituted motility, affected cyclic AMP presence inhibitor phosphodiesterase. activities pyruvate kinase flagellar ATPase given preparation HTRES comparable. Rabbit spermatozoa metabolic strategy similar muscle cells. suggests major use sperm cell's metabolic machinery maintenance energy contractile work motility minor amounts metabolic energy appear consumed reactions, including involved fertilization.
