 Glutaric acidemia type inherited metabolic disorder caused severe deficiency mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity leading accumulation predominantly glutaric 3-hydroxyglutaric acids brain tissue affected patients. Considering toxic role recently postulated quinolinic acid neuropathology glutaric acidemia type I, present work investigated whether combination quinolinic acid glutaric 3-hydroxyglutaric acids mixture glutaric plus 3-hydroxyglutaric acids could alter brain energy metabolism. parameters evaluated cerebral cortex young rats glucose utilization, lactate formation (14)CO(2) production labeled glucose acetate, well activities pyruvate dehydrogenase creatine kinase. first observed glutaric (5 mM), 3-hydroxyglutaric (1 mM) quinolinic acids (0.1 microM) per se alter parameters. Similarly, change parameters occurred combining glutaric quinolinic acids 3-hydroxyglutaric quinolinic acids. contrast, co-incubation glutaric plus 3-hydroxyglutaric acids increased glucose utilization, decreased (14)CO(2) generation glucose, inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase activity well total mitochondrial creatine kinase activities. glutaric plus 3-hydroxyglutaric acids-induced inhibitory effects creatine kinase prevented antioxidants glutathione catalase plus superoxide dismutase, indicating participation reactive oxygen species. data indicate synergic action glutaric 3-hydroxyglutaric acids disturbing energy metabolism cerebral cortex young rats.
