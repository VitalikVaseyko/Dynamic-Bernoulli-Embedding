 Allostery phenomenon observed many proteins binding macromolecular partner small-molecule ligand one location leads specific perturbations site direct contact region binding occurs. list proteins allosteric regulation includes AGC protein kinases. AGC kinases conserved allosteric site, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-interacting fragment (PIF) pocket, regulates protein ATP-binding, activity, interaction substrates. study, identify small molecules bind ATP-binding site affect PIF pocket AGC kinase family members, PDK1 Aurora kinase. describe mechanistic details show although PDK1 Aurora kinase inhibitors bind conserved ATP-binding site, differentially modulate physiological interactions PIF-pocket site. work outlines strategy developing bidirectional small-molecule allosteric modulators protein kinases signaling proteins.
