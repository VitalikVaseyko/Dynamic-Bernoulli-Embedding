 1. examined effects, gluconeogenesis lactate, altering energy metabolism two ways: (a) primarily lowering cytosolic ATP levels use atractyloside 2,5 anhydromannose; (b) decreasing mitochondrial energy generation use classical uncoupler, dinitrophenol. 2. Agents lower cytosolic ATP inhibit gluconeogenesis increase pyruvate kinase flux (PK) correspondingly, pyruvate carboxylase P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase fluxes unchanged, least gluconeogenesis inhibited 50%. 3. Dinitrophenol, hand, although also induces (smaller) increase PK, primarily decreases gluconeogenesis effect mitochondrial step gluconeogenic pathway. 4. Low concentrations dinitrophenol increase Krebs cycle oxidation least 50% significant inhibition gluconeogenesis lactate occurs.
