 Specific activities diacylglycerol acyltransferase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase pyruvate dehydrogenase studied virgin, pregnant, lactating involuting rat mammary glands. inverse relationship evident cAMP binding protein kinase(s) activities enzymes lactating rat mammary glands. Results suggested free Ca2+ concentration may also contribute control activity pyruvate dehydrogenase glands. However, consistent change observed activities enzymes cAMP binding young, pregnant involuting rat mammary glands. Calmodulin levels paralleled bound Ca2+ except lactating rats. Almost parameters studied peaked day 8 lactation.
