 Pyk1 (pyruvate kinase 1) Saccharomyces cerevisiae characterized substrate PKA (protein kinase A) bovine heart yeast. designing Pyk1 synthetic peptides containing potential PKA sequence targets (Ser22, Thr94 Thr478) determined peptide S22 substrate PKA vitro, K(sp)* (specificity constant) 10-fold 3-fold higher Kemptide bovine heart yeast PKA respectively. vitro phosphorylation Pyk1 S22A mutant protein decreased much 90% compared wild-type Pyk1 Pyk1 T94A mutant. K(sp)* values Pyk1 Pyk1 T94A same, indicating proteins phosphorylated site PKA. Two-dimensional PAGE Pyk1 Pyk1 S22A indicates vivo S22A mutation prevented formation one Pyk1 isoforms. conclude yeast major PKA phosphorylation site Pyk1 Ser22. Phosphorylation Ser22 leads Pyk1 enzyme active absence FBP (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate). specificity yeast mammalian PKA towards S22 peptide towards whole Pyk1 protein measured compared. K(sp)* S22 peptide higher Pyk1, indicating peptide modelled Pyk1 much better substrate Pyk1, regardless tissue used source PKA. However, K(m) Pyk1 protein lower better substrate, S22 peptide, indicating ground-state substrate binding major determinant substrate specificity PKA.
