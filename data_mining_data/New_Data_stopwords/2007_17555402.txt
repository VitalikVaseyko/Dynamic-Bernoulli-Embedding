 survival metazoan organisms dependent upon utilization O2 substrate COX (cytochrome c oxidase), constitutes Complex IV mitochondrial respiratory chain. Premature transfer electrons, either Complex Complex III, results increased generation ROS (reactive oxygen species). Recent studies identified two critical adaptations may function prevent excessive ROS production hypoxic cells. First, expression PDK1 [PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) kinase 1] induced. PDK1 phosphorylates inactivates PDH, mitochondrial enzyme converts pyruvate acetyl-CoA. combination hypoxia-induced expression LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A), converts pyruvate lactate, PDK1 reduces delivery acetyl-CoA tricarboxylic acid cycle, thus reducing levels NADH FADH2 delivered electron-transport chain. Secondly, subunit composition COX altered hypoxic cells increased expression COX4-2 subunit, optimizes COX activity hypoxic conditions, increased degradation COX4-1 subunit, optimizes COX activity aerobic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 controls metabolic adaptation mammalian cells hypoxia activating transcription genes encoding PDK1, LDHA, COX4-2 LON, mitochondrial protease required degradation COX4-1. COX subunit switching occurs yeast, completely different regulatory mechanism, suggesting selection O2-dependent homoeostatic regulation mitochondrial respiration ancient likely shared eukaryotic organisms.
