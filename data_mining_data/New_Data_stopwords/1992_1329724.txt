 Levels mRNA glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase analysed liver regeneration. Levels mRNA glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase L-pyruvate kinase) decreased rapidly partial hepatectomy. Glucokinase mRNA increased 16-24 h, returning normal values time. L-pyruvate kinase mRNA recovered control levels 168 h. contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA increased rapidly liver resection remained high regenerative process. However, levels fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA modified significantly. results correlate reported increased rate gluconeogenesis changes enzyme levels partial hepatectomy. effect stress mRNA levels also studied. enzymes showed variations mRNA levels surgical stress. general, differences pronounced regenerating liver sham-operated animals, practically normalized 24 h.
