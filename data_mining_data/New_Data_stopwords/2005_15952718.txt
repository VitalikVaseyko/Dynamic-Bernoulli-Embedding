 Change expression body fluid proteins caused many diseases environmental disturbances. changes tear proteins also associated various pathological eye conditions. Especially, chronic blepharitis one common conditions seen ophthalmologist's office. However, specific clinical diagnostic tests blepharitis, difficult treat effectively. Therefore, aim study screen prognostic diagnostic marker tear proteins blepharitis investigate pathogenesis disease using proteomics techniques. tear proteins expressed patients suffering blepharitis (patient, n=19) healthy volunteers (control, n=27) analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique. differentially expressed proteins patients identified ESI-Q-TOF (electrospray-quadrupole-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry confirmed western blotting. Nine proteins patient regulated 50% compared control: serum albumin precursor, alpha-1 antitrypsin, lacritin precursor, lysozyme, Ig-kappa chain VIII, prolactin inducible protein (PIP/GCDFP-15), cystatin-SA III, pyruvate kinase, unnamed protein. use two-dimensional eletrophoretic technique could give insight disease-related protein expression changes tear fluids. findings reveal composition tear proteins blepharitis patients different healthy subjects may provide insights pathogenesis blepharitis.
