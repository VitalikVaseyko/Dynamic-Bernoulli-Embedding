 Aripiprazole atypical antipsychotic drug known cause phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) PC12 cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying phosphorylation aripiprazole-treated PC12 cells yet clarified. Here, using PC12 cells, show cells incubated 24 h aripiprazole 50 muM 25 mM glucose underwent decrease NAD(+)/NADH ratio. Aripiprazole suppressed cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity enhanced activities pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate synthase Complex I. changes enzyme activities coincided well NADH, NAD(+), NAD(+)/NADH ratio. However, bioenergetic peril judged lowered COX activity might accompanied excessive occurrence apoptotic cell death aripiprazole-treated cells, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, rather increased. hand, PC12 cells incubated 24 h clozapine 50 muM 25 mM glucose, NAD(+)/NADH ratio change. Also, COX activity decreased; PDH activity enhanced. results suggest aripiprazole-treated PC12 cells responded bioenergetic peril effectively clozapine-treated ones return ATP biosynthesis back toward ordinary level. finding might related fact aripiprazole alone causes phosphorylation AMPK PC12 cells.
