 demonstrated acute arginine administration decreases antioxidant defenses compromises enzymes respiratory chain rat brain. study evaluated vivo vitro effect arginine pyruvate kinase activity, well effect important parameter oxidative stress namely thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) cerebrum rats. also tested influence antioxidants, namely alpha -tocopherol plus ascorbic acid effects elicited arginine order investigate possible participation free radicals effects arginine parameters. Results showed arginine acute administration inhibited pyruvate kinase activity cerebrum rats, well increased TBA-RS. hand, arginine added incubation medium, vitro studies, alter parameters rat cerebrum. addition, pretreatment antioxidants prevented reduction pyruvate kinase activity increase TBA-RS caused arginine. data indicate acute administration arginine induces lipid peroxidation rat cerebrum inhibition pyruvate kinase activity caused amino acid probably mediated free radicals since antioxidants prevented effect. presumed results might associated, least part, neuronal dysfunction patients affected hyperargininemia. Finally, suggest administration antioxidants considered adjuvant therapy specific diets hyperargininemia.
