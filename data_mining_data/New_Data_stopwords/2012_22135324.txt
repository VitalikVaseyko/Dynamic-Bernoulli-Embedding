 identify new gene regulatory pathways controlling skeletal muscle energy metabolism, comparative studies conducted muscle-specific transgenic mouse lines expressing nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha; muscle creatine kinase [MCK]-PPARalpha) PPARbeta/delta (MCK-PPARbeta/delta). MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice known enhanced exercise performance, whereas MCK-PPARalpha mice perform low levels. Transcriptional profiling revealed lactate dehydrogenase b (Ldhb)/Ldha gene expression ratio increased MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle, isoenzyme shift diverts pyruvate mitochondrion final steps glucose oxidation. PPARbeta/delta gain- loss-of-function studies skeletal myotubes demonstrated PPARbeta/delta, PPARalpha, interacts exercise-inducible kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) synergistically activate Ldhb gene transcription cooperating myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) PPARbeta/delta ligand-independent manner. MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle shown high glycogen stores, increased levels GLUT4, augmented capacity mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, suggesting broad reprogramming glucose utilization pathways. Lastly, exercise studies demonstrated MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice persistently oxidized glucose compared nontransgenic controls, exhibiting supranormal performance. results identify transcriptional regulatory mechanism increases capacity muscle glucose utilization pattern resembles effects exercise training.
