 Dysregulation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway occurs frequently human cancer. PTEN tumor suppressor PIK3CA oncogene mutations direct PI3K-dependent tumorigenesis largely activation AKT/PKB kinase. However, show phosphoprotein profiling functional genomic studies many PIK3CA mutant cancer cell lines human breast tumors exhibit minimal AKT activation diminished reliance AKT anchorage-independent growth. Instead, cells retain robust PDK1 activation membrane localization exhibit dependency PDK1 substrate SGK3. SGK3 undergoes PI3K- PDK1-dependent activation PIK3CA mutant cancer cells. Thus, PI3K may promote cancer AKT-dependent AKT-independent mechanisms. Knowledge differential PI3K/PDK1 signaling could inform rational therapeutics cancers harboring PIK3CA mutations.
