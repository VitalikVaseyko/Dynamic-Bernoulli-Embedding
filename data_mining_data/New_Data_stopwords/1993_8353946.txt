 describe automated enzymatic procedure quantitate creatine serum urine. assay, requires pretreatment sample, creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.1.7.40) used auxiliary enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) used indicator reaction. CK also used starting reagent. Data obtained present method creatine measurement serum compared Jaffe method enzymatic method: = 1.13x - 7.58, SE = 4.48, r = 0.925 (Jaffe); = 1.17x + 2.73, SE = 5.06, r = 0.962 (enzymatic); creatine measurement urine: = 0.63x + 39.74, SE = 296.7 r = 0.719 (Jaffe). present method provides improved precision: total CVs serum, determined present comparative methods, respectively, 3.5-8.9%, 8.2-43.0%, 5.3-16%; urine, CVs 3.3-5.1% 9.6-21.2% present comparative method, respectively. established normal reference interval 13-74 13-89 mumol/L creatine serum, 175-700 150-1200 mumol/24 h creatine urine men women, respectively.
