 rare case hereditary erythrocyte enzymopathy, namely 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) deficiency, found Italian family. activity enzyme reduced 35% propositus mother, normal three members family. 6PGD deficiency associated variable reticulocyte count recurrent increased unconjugated bilirubinemia without anemia propositus, clinical hematological symptoms evident mother. Increased levels erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity reduced glutathione (GSH) observed, indicating slight decrease mean red blood cell (RBC) age activation reducing systems. episodic hemolytic events jaundice observed propositus may result defective RBC ability counteract conditions marked oxidative stress. report importance 6PGD estimation proper analysis glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency also highlighted. fact present study, presence 6PGD deficiency could mistaken partial G6PD deficiency assay G6PD activity performed without correcting 6PGD activity.
