 Seeds provide basis many food, feed, fuel products. Continued increases seed yield, composition, quality require improved understanding developing seed converts carbon nitrogen supplies storage. Current knowledge process often based premise transcriptional regulation directly translates via enzyme concentration flux. attempt highlight metabolic control, explore genotypic differences carbon partitioning vitro cultured developing embryos oilseed rape (Brassica napus). determined biomass composition well 79 net fluxes, levels 77 metabolites, 26 enzyme activities specific focus central metabolism nine selected germplasm accessions. Overall, observed tradeoff biomass component fractions lipid starch. increasing lipid content spectrum genotypes, plastidic fatty acid synthesis glycolytic flux increased concomitantly, glycolytic intermediates decreased. lipid/starch tradeoff reflected proteome level, pointing significance (posttranslational) metabolic control. Enzyme activity/flux metabolite/flux correlations suggest plastidic pyruvate kinase exerts flux control lipid/starch tradeoff likely mediated allosteric feedback regulation phosphofructokinase ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Quantitative data also used calculate vivo mass action ratios, reaction equilibria, metabolite turnover times. Compounds like cyclic 3',5'-AMP sucrose-6-phosphate identified potentially involved far unknown mechanisms metabolic control. study provides rich source quantitative data studying central metabolism.
