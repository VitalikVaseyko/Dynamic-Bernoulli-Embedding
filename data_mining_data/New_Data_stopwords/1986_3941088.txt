 regulatory effects alpha-ketoisovalerate purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase investigated. Incubation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 0.125 10 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused initial lag enzymatic activity, followed linear inhibited rate NADH production. Incubation 0.0125 0.05 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition, cause initial lag pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Gel electrophoresis fluorography demonstrated incorporation acyl groups alpha-keto[2-14C]isovalerate dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component enzyme complex. Acylation prevented pyruvate arsenite plus NADH. Endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity stimulated specifically K+, contrast previous reports, kinase stimulation K+ correlated pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation. Maximum kinase activity presence K+ inhibited 62% 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate, inhibited 27% presence 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate 0.1 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate. Pyruvate affect kinase inhibition thiamin pyrophosphate either 0.05 2 mM. present study demonstrates alpha-ketoisovalerate acylates heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggests acylation prevents thiamin pyrophosphate-mediated kinase inhibition.
