 Arginine (Arg), injected intraperitoneally rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), increases plasma concentrations glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin three- 10-fold. Resulting ratios glucagon GLP-1 insulin unchanged 20-d food-deprived fish (saline, 1.28 vs. Arg, 0.93; significant) slightly increased feeding trout (saline, 0.70 vs. Arg, 0.92; P<0.05). food-deprived juveniles, Arg injection leads significant decreases plasma fatty acids (saline, 1.65 mM L(-1) vs. Arg, 1.09 mM L(-1); P<0.05) increases glycogen phosphorylase total activity (saline, 3.7 units g(-1) vs. Arg, 4.6 units g(-1); P<0.05) degree phosphorylation (saline, 1.7 units g(-1) vs. Arg, 2.33 units g(-1); P<0.05). Plasma liver glucose liver enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme) unaffected. Otherwise, fish show changes plasma metabolites expected food deprivation. Arg injection feeding fish results decreases plasma fatty acids, liver glycogen, glucose, liver glucose 6-phosphate concentrations increase. Hepatocytes isolated feeding fish injected Arg 2 h previously show significantly lower rates lactate oxidation controls (85% control), rates gluconeogenesis hormonal responses mammalian glucagon GLP-1 remain unchanged. Rates lactate oxidation gluconeogenesis significantly decreased 5%-10% treatment porcine insulin. Complete immunoneutralization insulin rabbit antisalmon insulin serum decreases hepatic glucose 6-phosphate concentrations abolishes Arg-dependent effects glycogen phosphorylase. appears short-term increases pancreatic hormones cause minor metabolic readjustments relatively short time frame covered experiments. Surprisingly, complete removal insulin immediate altering detrimental effects key metabolites metabolic pathways, even glucagon GLP-1 concentrations concurrently several-fold higher usual. data clearly show dual role Arg fish metabolism.
