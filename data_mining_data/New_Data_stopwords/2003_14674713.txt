 Hepatic genes crucial carbohydrate lipid homeostasis regulated insulin glucose metabolism. However, relative contributions insulin glucose regulation metabolic gene expression poorly defined vivo. address issue, adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression glucokinase used determine effects increased hepatic glucose metabolism gene expression fasted ad libitum fed rats. fasted state, 3 fold glucokinase overexpression sufficient mimic feeding-induced increases pyruvate kinase acetyl CoA carboxylase mRNA levels, demonstrating primary role glucose metabolism regulation genes vivo. Conversely, glucokinase overexpression unable mimic feeding-induced alterations fatty acid synthase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase PEPCK mRNAs, indicating insulin primary regulator genes. Interestingly, glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA increased glucokinase overexpression fasted fed states, providing evidence, conditions, dominance glucose insulin signaling gene vivo. Importantly, glucokinase overexpression alter sterol regulatory element binding protein 1-c mRNA levels vivo glucose signaling alter expression gene primary hepatocytes. conclude modest hepatic overexpression glucokinase sufficient alter expression metabolic genes without changing expression SREBP-1c.
