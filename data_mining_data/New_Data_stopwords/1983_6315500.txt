 Pyruvate kinase purified codfish muscle. ratio phosphotransferase oxalacetate decarboxylase activities remains relatively constant throughout purification steps. two activities dependent well sensitive sulfhydryl reagents. presence dithioerythritol, one molecular form pyruvate kinase detected. However, enzyme exists four pseudoisozymes presence 2-mercaptoethanol. pseudoisozymes codfish pyruvate kinase interconvertible influence sulfhydryl reagents.
