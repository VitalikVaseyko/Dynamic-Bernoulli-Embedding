 developed implemented model predict positional isotopomer distribution various hepatic metabolites labeled [U-13C3]lactate and/or [U-13C3]pyruvate given relative flux rates citric acid cycle gluconeogenesis reactions. model includes (i) isotopic exchange alpha-ketoglutarate glutamate, (ii) reversible isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, (iii) active ATP-citrate lyase, (iv) aspartate malate shuttles separate cytosolic mitochondrial pools oxaloacetate, malate, fumarate. parameter estimation routine fit mass isotopomer distribution selected metabolites measured gas chromatography-mass spectrometry model predicted distributions. fit measured mass isotopomer distributions phosphoenolpyruvate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, pyruvate isolated fasted rat livers perfused [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate. fitting yielded rates express relative pyruvate carboxylase: citric acid cycle represented irreversible alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase = 0.32; citrate synthase = 0.64; reversal isocitrate dehydrogenase = 0.52; citrate lyase = 0.33, aspartate shuttle = 0.24, malate shuttle = 0.44. Rates calculated cytosolic mitochondrial fumarate malate dehydrogenase reactions subject uncertainties indicated identifiability analyses. Previous forms model include pyruvate kinase, exchange alpha-ketoglutarate glutamate, reversibility isocitrate dehydrogenase, and/or ATP-citrate lyase activity successful predicting measured values. model offers general tool studying regulation citric acid cycle gluconeogenesis readily modified 13C-labeled lactate pyruvate substrate.
