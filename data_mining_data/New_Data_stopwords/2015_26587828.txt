 Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) complex neoplasias may present unexpected clinical behavior, imperative identify new biological markers predict patient prognosis provide new therapeutic options. main aim present study evaluate prognostic value metabolism-related key proteins adrenocortical carcinoma. immunohistochemical expression MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, CD147, CD44, GLUT1 CAIX evaluated series 154 adult patients adrenocortical neoplasia associated patients' clinicopathological parameters. significant increase found membranous expression MCT4, GLUT1 CAIX carcinomas, compared adenomas. Importantly MCT1, GLUT1 CAIX expressions significantly associated poor prognostic variables, including high nuclear grade, high mitotic index, advanced tumor staging, presence metastasis, well shorter overall disease free survival. opposition, MCT2 membranous expression associated favorable prognostic parameters. Importantly, cytoplasmic expression CD147 identified independent predictor longer overall survival cytoplasmic expression CAIX independent predictor longer disease-free survival. provide evidence metabolic reprogramming adrenocortical malignant tumors towards hyperglycolytic acid-resistant phenotype, associated poor prognosis.
