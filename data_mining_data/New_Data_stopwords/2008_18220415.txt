 Association PDHK2 GST-L2 (glutathione-S-transferase fused inner lipoyl domain (L2) dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2)) dimers enhanced K+ higher affinity K+ binding occurs PDHK2 active site. Supporting distinct K+ binding site, NH4+ ion effectively replace K+ aiding GST-L2 binding. 50 mM K+, Pi enhanced interference ADP, ATP, pyruvate PDHK2 binding GST-L2. inclusion Pi ADP ATP plus pyruvate greatly hindered PDHK2 binding GST-L2 promoted PDHK2 forming tetramer. Reciprocally, GST-L2 interference ATP/ADP binding also required elevated K+ increased Pi. Potent inhibition Nov3r E2-activated PDHK2 activity (IC50 approximately 7.8 nM) required elevated K+ Pi. Nov3r modestly inhibited low activity PDHK2 without E2. binding lipoyl group binding site, Nov3r prevented PDHK2 binding E2 GST-L2. Nov3r interfered high-affinity binding ADP pyruvate via Pi-dependent mechanism. Thus, GST-L2 binding PDHK2 supported K+ binding site distinct active site. Pi makes major contributions ligands interfering PDHK2 binding GST-L2, conversion PDHK2 dimer tetramer, Nov3r (an acetyl-lipoate analog) interfering binding ADP pyruvate. Pi suggested facilitate transmission within PDHK2 stimulatory signal acetylation distal lipoyl-group binding site active site.
