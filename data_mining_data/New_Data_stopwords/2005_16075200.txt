 Lactobacillus casei BL23, phosphofructokinase activity higher cells utilizing sugars transported phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). phosphofructokinase gene (pfk) cloned L. casei shown clustered gene encoding pyruvate kinase (pyk). pfk pyk genes cotranscribed induced upon growth sugars transported PTS. Contrarily model proposed Lactococcus lactis, global catabolite regulator protein (CcpA) involved PTS-induced transcription pfk pyk, ccpA mutation resulted slight increase pfk-pyk expression L. casei. weak regulation evidenced CcpA binding region pfk-pyk promoter contained two cre sequences significantly deviated consensus. PTS induction pfk-pyk seems counteracted CcpA-mediated repression. results suggest need accommodate levels pfk-pyk mRNA availability sugars fulfilled L. casei PTS/CcpA-mediated signal transduction different L. lactis.
