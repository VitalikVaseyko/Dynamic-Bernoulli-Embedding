 liver X receptors, LXRalpha (NR1H3) LXRbeta (NR1H2), ligand-activated transcription factors belong nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. LXRs play critical role cholesterol homeostasis bile acid metabolism. addition, oral administration LXR agonists mice results elevated hepatic fatty acid synthesis steatosis increased secretion triglyceride-rich low density lipoprotein resulting hypertriglyceridemia. increased hepatic lipogenesis largely attributed LXR-dependent up-regulation sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression. However, reported treating Srebp-1c null mice synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 still results enhanced expression many lipogenic genes, suggesting additional mechanisms LXR enhance hepatic lipogenesis. report, identify carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) LXR target independently enhances up-regulation select lipogenic genes. ChREBP promoter contains functional LXR-binding sites confer receptor-dependent binding transactivation. show T0901317 treatment mice associated up-regulation ChREBP target gene, liver-type pyruvate kinase. Therefore, activation LXR increases ChREBP mRNA via enhanced transcription also modulates ChREBP activity. establishes LXR master lipogenic transcription factor, directly regulates SREBP-1c ChREBP enhance hepatic fatty acid synthesis.
