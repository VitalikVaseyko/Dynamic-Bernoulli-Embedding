 Eukaryotic transcription dynamic process relying large number proteins. measuring cycling expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene human cells, constructed detailed stochastic model single-gene transcription molecular level using realistic kinetics diffusion protein complex dynamics. observed gene induction caused approximate 60 min periodicity several transcription related processes: first, covalent histone modifications presence many regulatory proteins transcription start site; second, RNA polymerase II activity; third, chromatin loop formation; fourth, mRNA accumulation. model predict precise timing single-gene activity leading transcriptional cycling cell population level take account sequential irreversible multistep nature transcriptional initiation. propose cyclic nature population gene expression primarily based intrinsic periodicity transcription process itself.
