 Metabolism lies heart cell biology. metabolism cancer cells significantly different normal counterparts tumorigenesis progression. Elevated glucose metabolism one hallmarks cancer cells, even aerobic conditions. Warburg effect allows cancer cells meet high energy demands supply biological materials anabolic processes including nucleotide lipid synthesis, also minimizes reactive oxygen species production mitochondria, thereby providing growth advantage tumors. Indeed, mitochondria also play essential role tumor development. information numorous microRNAs emerged, importance metabolic phenotypes mediated microRNAs cancer increasingly emphasized. However, consequences dysregulation Warburg effect mitochondrial metabolism modulated microRNAs tumor initiation progression still largely unclear.
