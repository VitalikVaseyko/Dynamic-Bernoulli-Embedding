 significant increase plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase glutamate-pyruvate transaminase observed 6 h intraperitoneal administration D-galactosamine (D-Galn). Three hours administration D-Galn, vitamin C concentration liver decreased significantly compared control group thereafter hepatic vitamin C concentration remained significantly lower level. Phosphorylated JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) phosphorylated ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) started increasing 3 h D-Galn treatment remained high level 6-12 h treatment, phosphorylated p38 MAPK increased significantly 6 h D-Galn administration. results indicated oxidative stress activation JNK ERK took place almost simultaneously, followed activation p38 MAPK.
