 mini-review focuses changes ATP creatine phosphate concentrations fish sperm storage conditions. storage catfish sperm 4 degrees C leads ATP depletion decreased sperm motility. rate intracellular ATP depletion diminished addition energetic substrates sperm storage medium, lactate + pyruvate efficient substrates maintaining ATP concentrations catfish sperm. decrease ATP concentration closely associated increases AMP hypoxanthine content. contrast catfish sperm, carp sperm able maintain intracellular ATP concentration close physiological level storage. Collectively, results suggest fish species differ terms energy metabolism spermatozoa semen storage medium must carefully selected particular fish species maintain ATP concentration adenylate energy charge close physiological values long possible.
