 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) upregulated starvation many tissues body starvation. causes inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex blocks pyruvate oxidation conserves lactate alanine gluconeogenesis. Enhanced PDK4 expression may caused increase free fatty acids occurs starvation. Free fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), activation PPARalpha promote PDK4 expression. model supported findings reported WY-14,643, synthetic PPARalpha activator, increases PDK4 expression wild-type mice PPARalpha-null mice. Starvation likewise increases expression PDK4 tissues wild-type mice tissues PPARalpha-null mice. findings document functional importance PPARalpha PDK4 expression starvation suggest important role elevated free fatty acids induction.
