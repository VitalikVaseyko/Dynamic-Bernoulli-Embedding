 dependence forward pyruvate kinase reaction concentrations ADP Mg2+ studied. shown high total ADP concentrations (2-15 mM) exceeding total Mg2+ concentration medium lead inhibition pyruvate kinase reaction, whereas relatively high Mg2+ concentrations (up 15 mM) cause inhibition. kinetics reaction described best way scheme incorporating active PEP . E . Mg2+ . Mg . ADP complex dead-end complexes containing free ADP. analysis experimental data allows determine coefficients rate equation calculate values kinetic parameters. values constants obtained used mathematical simulation reaction basis kinetic scheme given. mathematical model obtained describes satisfactorily experimentally determined dependences, indicative correctness model.
