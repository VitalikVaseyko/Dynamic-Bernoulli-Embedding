 BACKGROUND: Clonorchis sinensis, causative agent clonorchiasis, classified one neglected tropical diseases affects 15 million people globally. hepatobiliary disease highly associated cholangiocarcinoma. key molecules infectivity subsistence trematodes, glycolytic enzymes targets drug vaccine development. Clonorchis sinensis pyruvate kinase (CsPK), crucial glycolytic enzyme, characterized research. RESULTS: Differences observed sequences spatial structures CsPK PKs humans, rats, mice rabbits. CsPK possessed characteristic active site signature (IKLIAKIENHEGV) unique sites lacked N-terminal domain. predicted subunit molecular mass (Mr) CsPK 53.1 kDa. Recombinant CsPK (rCsPK) homopentamer Mr. approximately 290 kDa native PAGE gel filtration chromatography. Significant differences protein mRNA levels CsPK observed among four life stages C. sinensis (egg, adult worm, excysted metacercaria metacercaria), suggesting developmental stages may associated diverse energy demands. CsPK widely distributed adult worms. Moreover, intense Th1-biased immune response persistently elicited rats immunized rCsPK. Also, rat anti-rCsPK sera suppressed C. sinensis adult subsistence vivo vitro. CONCLUSIONS: sequences spatial structures, molecular mass, expression profile CsPK characterized. rCsPK indicated homopentamer. Rat anti-rCsPK sera suppressed C. sinensis adult subsistence vivo vitro. CsPK worthy study promising target drug vaccine development.
