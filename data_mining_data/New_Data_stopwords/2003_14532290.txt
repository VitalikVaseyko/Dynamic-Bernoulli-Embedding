 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG), nonmetabolizable glucose analogue, blocks glycolysis phosphohexose isomerase step frequently used glucose starvation mimetic studies wide variety physiological dysfuctions. However, effect 2-DG protein glycosylation related signal pathways investigated depth. HeLa, HPV18-positive cervical carcinoma line, 2-DG treatment down-regulates human papillomavirus early gene transcription. down-regulation also achieved low glucose supply hypoxia, suggesting response commonly modulated cellular glucose energy level. investigated 2-DG low glucose affect transcriptional activity. Human papillomavirus gene transcription marginally affected inhibition ATP synthesis supplementation pyruvate 2-DG-treated cells, suggesting poor ATP generation involved limited extent. 2-DG treatment also inhibited activation p21 WAF1 promoter, controlled p53 and/or Sp1. reporter assay using p21 WAF1 promoter constructs, 2-DG exerted strong inhibitory effect Sp1 activity. DNA binding activity Sp1 2-DG-treated HeLa cells intact, whereas severely impaired cells incubated low glucose medium hypoxic condition. Unexpectedly, Sp1 heavily modified GlcNAc 2-DG-treated cells, least partially attributed inhibitory effect 2-DG N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity. results suggest 2-DG, like low glucose hypoxic condition, down-regulates Sp1 activity, hyper-GlcNAcylation instead hypo-GlcNAcylation.
