 Oxidative stress recognized key participant development diabetic complications vasculature. One seminal studies advancing role oxidative stress vascular endothelial cells proposed oxidative stress-mediated diversion glycolytic intermediates pathological pathways key underlying element development diabetic complications. widely recognized flux glycolysis slows diabetes. However, several bottlenecks develop glycolytic pathway, including glucose transport, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase. limiting steps glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sensitive oxidative stress, leading hypothesis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate inactivation ribosylation underlies diversion glycolytic intermediates pathological pathways. However, recent studies question mechanism underlying effect reactive oxygen species key enzymes glycolytic pathway. present review critiques major premises hypothesis concludes study role oxidative stress development diabetes-mediated vasculature dysfunction warranted.
