 activities 10 enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism measured desiccated rehydrated fronds desiccation-tolerant pteridophyte Selaginella lepidophylla (Hook. & Grev.) Spring. Enzyme conservation defined ratio desiccated hydrated frond enzyme activity. mean level conservation 74%, nine 10 enzymes showing significant activity increases (P<0.05) hydration. mean photosynthetic enzyme conservation significantly lower (P=0.05) mean glycolytic respiratory enzymes combined. Chloramphenicol inhibited normal activity increase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (NADPH)triose-P dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase upon rehydration. Cycloheximide affect normal activity increase three enzymes. concluded substantial enzyme conservation beneficial rapid resumption metabolic activity resurrection plants.
