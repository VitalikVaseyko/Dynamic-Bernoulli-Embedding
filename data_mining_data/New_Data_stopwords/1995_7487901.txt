 investigated signalling pathways involved stimulation glycogen fatty acid synthesis insulin rat fat cells using wortmannin, inhibitor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, rapamycin, blocks activation p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). Insulin produced decrease activity glycogen synthase kinase-3 likely important observed stimulation glycogen synthase. actions found sensitive inhibition wortmannin. Activation three processes involved stimulation fatty acid synthesis glucose insulin, namely glucose uptake, acetyl-CoA carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase. Whereas wortmannin largely abolished effects insulin glucose utilization acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, without effect stimulation pyruvate dehydrogenase. Although epidermal growth factor stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase greater extent insulin, unable mimic effect insulin glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, glucose utilization, acetyl-CoA carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase. Rapamycin also failed appreciable effect stimulation parameters insulin, although block effect insulin p70S6K. conclude activity phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase required effects insulin glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake acetyl-Co-AN carboxylase, involved signalling pyruvate dehydrogenase. Activation mitogen-activated protein kinase p70S6K, however, appear sufficient bring stimulation fatty acid glycogen synthesis. Altogether seems likely least four distinct signalling pathways involved effects insulin rat fat cells.
