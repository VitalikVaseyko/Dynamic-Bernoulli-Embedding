 catabolic, NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD-GDH) Neurospora crassa carbon catabolite repression. Cells grown glycolytic carbon source, sucrose, low basal levels enzyme activity. Treatment repressed cells either polymyxin B amphotericin B resulted derepression NAD-GDH. Derepression transcriptional level occurred rapidly (within 30 min) response polymyxin B addition reached plateau within 2 h. Amphotericin B-induced derepression initiated slowly continued least 6 h, resulting specific activity comparable seen cells transferred glutamate sole carbon source. antibiotics significant effect upon activities two constitutive enzymes, pyruvate kinase malate dehydrogenase. Curiously, polymyxin B treatment derepressed invertase, another catabolite-repressed enzyme. addition 100 mM KCl growth medium blocked derepression antibiotics, addition 50 mM MgCl2 annulled derepression polymyxin B. ergosterol-deficient erg-1 mutant, resistant amphotericin B, derepress NAD-GDH treated drug. results consistent derepression resulting interactions antibiotics plasma membrane.
