 numerous reports melatonin inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF-1alpha, HIF-1alpha-inducible gene, VEGF, vivo vitro. inhibition HIF-1-VEGF pathway, melatonin reduces hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Herein discuss interaction melatonin HIF-1alpha HIF-1alpha-inducible genes terms currently known concerning HIF-1alpha hypoxia response element (HIF-1alpha-HRE) pathway. von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), also known VHL tumor suppressor, functions part ubiquitin ligase complex recognizes HIF-1alpha substrate. such, VHL part oxygen sensing mechanism cell. conditions hypoxia, HIF-1alpha stimulates transcription numerous HIF-1alpha-induced genes, including EPO, VEGF, PFKFB3; latter enzyme regulates glycolysis. Data several studies show ROS generated mitochondria conditions hypoxia stimulate HIF-1alpha. Since melatonin acts antioxidant reduces ROS, data suggest antioxidant action melatonin could account reduced HIF-1, less VEGF, reduced glycolysis cancer cells (Warburg effect). direct indirect inhibitory action (via reduction ROS) melatonin proteasome activity would account much published data.
