 Thyroid hormone mimetics alluring potential therapies diseases like dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), insulin resistance. Though diiodothyronines thought inactive, pharmacologic treatment 3,5- Diiodo-L-Thyronine (T2) reportedly reduces hepatic lipid content improves glucose tolerance fat-fed male rats. test this, male Sprague Dawley rats fed safflower-oil based high-fat diet treated T2 (0.25 mg/kg-d) vehicle. Neither 10 30 days T2 treatment effect weight, adiposity, plasma fatty acids, hepatic steatosis. Insulin action quantified vivo hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. T2 alter fasting plasma glucose insulin concentration. Basal endogenous glucose production (EGP) rate unchanged. clamp, difference insulin stimulated whole body glucose disposal. Insulin suppressed EGP 60% +/- 10 T2-treated rats compared 47% +/- 4 suppression vehicle group (p = 0.32). associated improvement hepatic insulin signaling; insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation ~2.5 fold greater T2-treated group compared vehicle-treated group (p = 0.003). change expression genes thought mediate effect T2 hepatic metabolism, including genes regulate hepatic lipid oxidation (ppara, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a), genes regulate hepatic fatty acid synthesis (srebp1c, acetyl coa carboxylase, fatty acid synthase), genes involved glycolysis gluconeogenesis (L-pyruvate kinase, glucose 6 phosphatase). Therefore, contrast previous reports, Sprague Dawley rats fed unsaturated fat diet, T2 administration failed improve NAFLD whole body insulin sensitivity. Though modest improvement hepatic insulin signaling, associated significant differences hepatic insulin action. study necessary diiodothyronines considered effective treatment NAFLD dyslipidemia.
