 paper describes characteristic properties altered form pyruvate kinase mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. partially purified enzyme require fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activity stabilised presence low high temperatures. enzyme displays absence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate hyperbolic kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate (Km, 0.11 mM), ADP (Km, 0.12 mM) K+ (Km, 11 mM). Sedimentation velocity experiments indicate mutated enzyme wild type enzyme S20,w values 8.9 8.6 respectively. mutant pyruvate insensitive fructose 1.6-bisphosphate capable growing synthetic media alcohol malate sole carbon source. steady-state intracellular levels phosphoenolpyruvate mutant suggest mechanisms prevent depletion metabolite despite active pyruvate kinase. Spontaneous reversion mutant yields clones normal enzyme activated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
