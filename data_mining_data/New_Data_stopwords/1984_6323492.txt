 P-815 mastocytoma cells increase level pyruvate kinase (PK) expression response chloroform-methanol extracts conditioned media, butyrate, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (but2cAMP) plus theophylline. butyrate effect indomethacin sensitive, suggesting prostaglandin (PG) active signaling factor. Moreover, chloroform-methanol extracts contain PGE2 PGF2 alpha additions latter enhance PK activity. PGE2 alone little effect acts synergistically PGF2 alpha. data show PGF2 alpha regulate PK levels. hand, factors may also active, since endogeneous but2cAMP plus theophylline effects indomethacin insensitive. factors increase PK activity also inhibit cellular growth; however, regulation PK expression uncoupled growth inhibition.
