 Conversion pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes M2- R-PK observed erythroid cell maturation. understand mechanism, analyzed PK gene R-PK deficient patient, whose erythrocytes M2-PK persistently expressed. point mutation, 1102 GTC-->TTC identified R-PK cDNA, caused single amino acid substitution 368Val-->Phe. residue close 372nd Gln, putative binding site monovalent cation (K+). impaired K+ binding would cause decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate, consequently variant PK may extremely unstable. Although proband's PK allele structural change, R-PK mRNA level reticulocytes decreased. findings suggested structural mutation near active site decreased mRNA level R-PK responsible disorder.
