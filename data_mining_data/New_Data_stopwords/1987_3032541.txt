 Acute hormonal regulation liver carbohydrate metabolism mainly involves changes cytosolic levels cAMP Ca2+. Epinephrine, acting beta 2-adrenergic receptors, glucagon activate adenylate cyclase liver plasma membrane mechanism involving guanine nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory enzyme. resulting accumulation cAMP leads activation cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which, turn, phosphorylates many intracellular enzymes involved regulation glycogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis. (1) phosphorylase b kinase, activated and, turn, phosphorylates activates phosphorylase, rate-limiting enzyme glycogen breakdown; (2) glycogen synthase, inactivated rate-controlling glycogen synthesis; (3) pyruvate kinase, inactivated important regulatory enzyme glycolysis; (4) 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase bifunctional enzyme, phosphorylation leads decreased formation fructose 2,6-P2, activator 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase inhibitor fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, important regulatory enzymes glycolysis gluconeogenesis. addition rapid effects glucagon beta-adrenergic agonists increase hepatic glucose output stimulating glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis inhibiting glycogen synthesis glycolysis, agents produce longer-term stimulatory effects gluconeogenesis altered synthesis certain enzymes gluconeogenesis/glycolysis amino acid metabolism. example, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase induced effect level transcription mediated cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Tyrosine amino-transferase, serine dehydratase, tryptophan oxygenase, glucokinase also regulated cAMP, part level specific messenger RNA synthesis. sympathetic nervous system neurohumoral agonists epinephrine norepinephrine also rapidly alter hepatic glycogen metabolism gluconeogenesis acting alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. primary response agonists phosphodiesterase-mediated breakdown plasma membrane polyphosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 inositol 1,4,5-P3 1,2-diacylglycerol. involves guanine nucleotide-binding protein different involved regulation adenylate cyclase. Inositol 1,4,5-P3 acts intracellular messenger Ca2+ mobilization releasing Ca2+ endoplasmic reticulum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
