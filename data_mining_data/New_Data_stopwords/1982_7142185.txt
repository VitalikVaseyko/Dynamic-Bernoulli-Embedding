 alpha-Chloroisocaproate shown inhibit phosphorylation inactivation rabbit liver branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase also inhibited alpha-ketoisocaproate analog, phosphorylation branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase much sensitive phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (I50 values 7.5 675 microM, respectively). Phosphorylation glycogen synthase six protein kinases inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate (1 mM). Although less sensitive phosphorylation complex, branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase also found inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate. latter inhibition competitive respect alpha-ketoacid substrates dehydrogenase (Ki values approximately 0.5 mM). alpha-Chloroisocaproate greatly stimulated capacity perfused rat heart decarboxylate [1-14C]leucine promoted conversion practically (99%) complex active form.
