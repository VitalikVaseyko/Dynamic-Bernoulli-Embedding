 Plasma glucose levels maintained precise balance glucose production use. Liver pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), 2 key enzymes glycolysis gluconeogenesis, respectively, play crucial role glucose homeostasis along skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT4). diabetic state, balance disturbed owing absence insulin, principal factor controlling regulation. present study, alloxan-diabetic animals high glucose levels 300 mmol/L taken administration Trigonella seed powder (TSP) diabetic animals assessed effect expression PK PEPCK liver GLUT4 distribution skeletal muscle alloxan-diabetic rats. TSP treatment diabetic animals resulted marked decrease plasma glucose levels. Trigonella treatment partially restored altered expression PK PEPCK. TSP treatment also corrected alterations distribution GLUT4 skeletal muscle.
