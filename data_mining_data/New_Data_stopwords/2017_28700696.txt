 Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) essential enzyme C4 photosynthesis plants, catalyzing ATP-driven conversion pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). used bacteria unicellular protists reverse, ATP-forming direction. Many weed species use C4 photosynthesis contrast world's major crops, C3 plants. Hence inhibitors PPDK may used C4-specific herbicides. screening library 80 commercially available kinase inhibitors, identified compounds derived bisindolylmaleimide (bisindolylmaleimide IV, IC50 = 0.76 +/- 0.13 muM) indirubin (indirubin-3'-monoxime, IC50 = 4.2 +/- 0.9 muM) showed high inhibitory potency towards PPDK among effective PPDK inhibitors described today. Physiological studies leaf tissues C4 model plant confirmed vivo inhibition C4-driven photosynthesis substances. Moreover, comparative docking studies non-inhibitory bisindolylmaleimide derivatives suggest selectivity towards PPDK may increased addition functional groups core structure.
