 order directly determine amount label exchange occurs tricarboxylic cycle labeled alanine lactate ingestion glucose load [1-13C]glucose administered continuous intraduodenal infusion awake catheterized rats achieve steady state jugular venous glycemia (160 mg/dl) 180 min. Liver freeze-clamped 90 180 min, perchloric acid extracts liver subjected 13C 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. Dilution oxaloacetate pool determined comparing intrahepatic 13C enrichments C2, C3 positions glutamate C2, C3 positions alanine lactate. addition steady state flux equations derived calculation relative fluxes pyruvate dehydrogenase/TCA cycle flux pyruvate kinase flux/total pyruvate utilization. glucose ingestion 24-h fasted rat direct conversion glucose responsible 34% glycogen. intrahepatic dilution factor labeled pyruvate oxaloacetate pool 2.4. Using factor, alanine lactate contributed approximately 55% glycogen formation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase flux ranged 24 35% total acetyl-coenzyme (CoA) production pyruvate kinase flux relative total pyruvate utilization approximately 40%.
