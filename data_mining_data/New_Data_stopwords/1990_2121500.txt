Blood samples taken antecubital vein supplementation period, without venous stasis, overnight fast. protocol allowed patients used controls. Five healthy subjects underwent identical protocol exclude effect ascorbate per se. Mean (SEM) plasma oxalate (mumol l-1) rose 30.3 (3.5) 48.4 (6.1) patients 1.4 (0.2) 6.8 (0.9) healthy subjects. Whole blood ascorbate (mg l-1) rose 7.0 (0.7) 26.6 (2.5) patients 9.3 (1.2) 17.8 (1.8) healthy subjects (reference range 7.5-20.0 mg l-1). changes observed either group plasma creatinine, bicarbonate, haemoglobin, erythrocyte 2,3,diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) 3 week supplementation period. supplementation lactate generation (area curve, mmol min l-1) 5 min following 60 period standardized ischaemic forearm exercise significantly (P = 0.026) greater patients [69.1 (4.7)] healthy subjects [46.9 (6.7)]; significant change lactate generation occurred either group ascorbate-induced hyperoxalaemia. conclude changes plasma oxalate order 20 mumol l-1 significant effect lactate generation 2,3,DPG levels uraemic subjects.
