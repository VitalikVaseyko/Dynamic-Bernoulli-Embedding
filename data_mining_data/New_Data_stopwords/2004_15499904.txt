 apple variety 'Usterapfel', two known genotypes, differ malic acid content. One hundred days full bloom, low-acid fruit (LA-fruit) contained 125 micromolg(-1) dry matter (DW) malate, high-acid genotype (HA-fruit) reached levels 627 micromolg(-1) DW. difference catalytic activity enzymes involved malate metabolism, PEPcarboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, NADP malic enzyme. [14C]glucose incorporation excised tissue either genotype, organic acid fraction labeled approximately extent. Furthermore, uptake [14C]malate significantly lower excised tissue LA-fruit. findings suggest low malate content LA-fruit result restricted ability accumulate malate apple parenchyma cells. different ability accumulate malate pronounced effect overall carbon partitioning. However, rate respiration rate malate synthesis similar genotypes. HA-fruit, glycolytic flux pyruvate kinase increased compensate carbon accumulated vacuole malate. Since malate storage LA-fruit restricted, easily available gluconeogenesis, correlated three-times higher activity PEPcarboxykinase. LA-fruit showed higher concentrations ATP, stimulated Glc6P fructose-6-phosphate formation. elevated hexosephosphate content led enhanced partitioning carbon starch (+40%), hemicellulose (+104%), sucrose (+40%) mature fruit. activation carbohydrate synthesis resulted significant drop glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P). meet increased demand Glc1P, activities neutral acid invertase, hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase higher LA-fruit. Glucose versatile substrate metabolic route fructose. also evident glycolytic flux apple dependent glucose level, reaction catalysed phosphoglucomutase contributed regulation carbon partitioning malate carbohydrate polymers.
