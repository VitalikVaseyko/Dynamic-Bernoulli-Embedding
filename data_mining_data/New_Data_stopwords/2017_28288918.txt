 hypothesized elevations carbon dioxide (CO2) commonly found modern buildings stimulate leukocytes produce microparticles (MPs) activate nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome due mitochondrial oxidative stress. Human murine neutrophils generate MPs high interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) content incubated ex vivo buffer equilibrated 0.1-0.4% additional CO2. Enhanced MPs production requires mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, mediated activities pyruvate carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Subsequent events leading MPs generation include perturbation inositol 1,3,5-triphosphate receptors, transient elevation intracellular calcium, activation protein kinase C NADPH oxidase (Nox). Concomitant activation type-2 nitric oxide synthase yields secondary oxidants resulting actin S-nitrosylation enhanced filamentous actin turnover. Numerous proteins linked short filamentous actin including vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, focal adhesion kinase, membrane phospholipid translocation enzymes flippase floppase, critical inflammasome protein ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck protein CARD domain). Elevations CO2 cause oligomerization inflammasome components ASC, NLRP3, caspase 1, thioredoxin interacting protein, calreticulin - protein endoplasmic reticulum, leading IL-1beta synthesis. increased production rate MPs containing elevated amounts IL-1beta persists hours short-term exposures elevated CO2.
