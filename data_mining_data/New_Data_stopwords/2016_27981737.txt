 SCOPE: Vitamin metabolites, retinoic acids (RA), related metabolic diseases, particular insulin resistance obesity. Here, studied roles 9-cis RA all-trans RA regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), enzyme involved fatty acid reesterification, crucial metabolic pathway adipose tissue (AT) lipid homeostasis. METHODS RESULTS: 9-cis RA all-trans RA treatment human murine explants, well adipocytes (3T3-F442A cell line) induces PDK4 expression mRNA protein level, via transcriptional mechanism. Using site-directed mutagenesis chomatin immuno-precipitation, showed activation involves two new RA responsive elements Pdk4 promoter, RAREa (DR1: -125/-112) RAREb (DR1: -86/-73), specific AT. Furthermore, even though endogeneous Pdk4 gene upregulated RA Fao cells, rat hepatoma cell line, induction occur newly found RAREs. CONCLUSION: study, showed adipocyte PDK4 gene new target vitamin derived RA might participate reduced fatty acid efflux adipocyte, step plays important role developement metabolic diseases.
