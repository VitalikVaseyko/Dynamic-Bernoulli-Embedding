 Human red cells incubated pH 8.2 30 mM phosphate concentration glucose, glucose plus methylene blue, inosine. 16 normal subjects, lactate production rate (LPR) glucose alone 92.2 +/- 7.5 mumoles per minute per liter red blood cell. methylene blue added, mean LPR 118.5 +/- 7.4 per cent control glucose values. inosine substrate mean LPR 68.5 +/- 6.0 per cent glucose. Lactate/glucose ratios averaged 1.36, presumably accumulation intermediates conditions high pH Pi. Patients various kinds anemias LPR's glucose usually markedly higher normal, LPR's inosine generally 2/3 glucose. LPR's anemic patients correlated degree reticulocytosis several patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency showed normal LPR red cell population age ignored, byt marked depression compared expected LPR degree reticulocytosis. LPR glucose red cells G6PD-deficient subjects decreased (not increased) methylene blue. Methylene blue, stimulating pentose phosphate pathway, also mediated oxidation NADH, thus complicating stoichiometry overall system. addition, results suggested dye may attacked -SH groups enzymes. normal red cells, lower LPR inosine glucose explained due consumption ATP hexose utilization (thus generating ADP triose reactions). confirmation, red cells incubated without substrate deplete ATP-, enhance ADP-, levels, LPR inosine exceeded glucose. Fluoride iodoacetate affected LPR glucose inosine, suggesting necessity adequate ATP levels hexose utilization. Overall glycolysis red cell seen resultant network metabolic reactions ADP ATP levels important control parameters.
