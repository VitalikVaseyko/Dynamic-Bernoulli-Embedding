 High intake dietary fructose shown exert number adverse metabolic eff ects humans experimental animals. present study designed investigate eff ect aqueous extract Tinospora cordifolia stem (TCAE) adverse eff ects fructose loading toward carbohydrate lipid metabolism rats. Adult male Wistar rats body weight around 200 g divided four groups, two fed starch diet two high fructose (66 %) diet. Plant extract TC (400 mg/kg/day) administered orally group starch fed rats highfructose fed rats. end 60 days experimental period, biochemical parameters related carbohydrate lipid metabolism assayed. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, elevated levels hepatic total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids (p < 0.05) observed fructose-fed rats completely prevented TCAE treatment. Alterations activities enzymes glucose metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthetase, lipoprotein lipase, malic enzyme) observed high fructose-fed rats prevented TCAE administration. conclusion, fi ndings indicate improvement glucose lipid metabolism high-fructose fed rats treatment Tinospora cordifolia, suggest plant used adjuvant prevention and/or management insulin resistance disorders related it.
