 Aerobic glycolysis one important hallmarks cancer cells eukaryotic cells. study, investigated relationship blocking mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) UK5099 metabolic alteration well stemness phenotype prostatic cancer cells. found blocking pyruvate transportation mitochondrial attenuated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) increased glycolysis. UK5099 treated cells showed significantly higher proportion side population (SP) fraction expressed higher levels stemness markers Oct3/4 Nanog. Chemosensitivity examinations revealed UK5099 treated cells became resistant chemotherapy compared non-treated cells. results demonstrate probably intimate connection metabolic reprogram stem-like phenotype LnCap cells vitro. propose MPC blocker (UK5099) application may ideal model Warburg effect studies, since attenuates mitochondrial OXPHOS increases aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon typically reflected Warburg effect. conclude impaired mitochondrial OXPHOS upregulated glycolysis related stem-like phenotype shift prostatic cancer cells.
