 Isorhamnetin flavonoid metabolite quercetin isolated water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica, Umbelliferae). reported isorhamnetin exerts beneficial effects including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative activities. present study investigated whether antioxidant activity isorhamnetin correlated anti-cancer effects colorectal cancer cells. Isorhamnetin significantly repressed cobalt chloride (CoCl2)- hypoxia-induced hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) accumulation HCT116 HT29 cells. compared quercetin, isorhamnetin showed potent inhibition HIF-1alpha. Moreover, inhibited CoCl2-induced activity hypoxia response element reporter gene HIF-1alpha-dependent transcription genes glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, carbonic anhydrase-IX, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Isorhamnetin also blocked hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation. antioxidant effects isorhamnetin confirmed observation CoCl2- H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Consistently, overexpressed HIF-1alpha decreased isorhamnetin N-acetyl-L-cysteine HEK293 cells. vitro migration invasion assay confirmed inhibitory effects isorhamnetin cancer cells. Collectively, results demonstrate isorhamnetin inhibits ROS-mediated HIF-1alpha accumulation, contributes anti-metastatic efficacy.
