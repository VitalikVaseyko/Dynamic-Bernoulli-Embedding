 survival patients pulmonary arterial hypertension closely related right ventricular function. progression right ventricular remodeling, energetic metabolism shifts oxidative mitochondrial metabolism glycolysis. normal physiological conditions, cardiomyocytes use major sources glucose fatty acids sustain continuous systolic workload energy supply. allows heart choose efficient substrate response environmental stimuli. Therefore, ATP production glucose preferred energy source fatty acids right ventricular remodeling. However, metabolic fate glucose altered mitochondrial metabolism actively suppressed. Metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis down-regulation mitochondrial oxidation, called Warburg effect. Studies animal models human RVF suggest reduced glucose oxidation increased glycolysis adaptive maladaptive right ventricular failure. Accordingly, gate-keeping enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) activated inhibited pyruvate mitochondria increased lactate dehydrogenase. Therefore, augmentation glucose oxidation beneficial right ventricular remodeling achieved inhibition PDK fatty acid oxidation. PDK inhibitor, Dicholoracetate (DCA) reduce pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation partially restore RV structure function promoting glucose mitochondrial oxidation. Moreover, partial inhibitors fatty acid oxidation would offered utilization improve right ventricular function. Although metabolic targeting drugs beneficial right ventricular remodeling, advantage modulating metabolic shift enhanced clinical performance still remains determined.
