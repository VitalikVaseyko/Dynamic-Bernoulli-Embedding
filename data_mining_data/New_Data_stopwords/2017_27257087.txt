 Hippocampal synaptic plasticity involves membrane trafficking events intracellular signaling, coordinated far clear. endosomal transport glutamate receptors postsynaptic membrane responds multiple signaling cascades triggered synaptic activity. work, identified adaptor protein containing plekstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) crucial element linking trafficking signaling synaptic plasticity. show APPL1 knockdown specifically impairs PI3K-dependent forms synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) metabotropic-glutamate-receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). Indeed, demonstrate APPL1 required activation phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) pathway response LTP induction. requirement bypassed membrane localization PI3K related phosphoinositide binding. Interestingly, inhibitors PDK1 (also known PDPK1) Akt effect LTP expression. Therefore, conclude APPL1 gates PI3K activation plasma membrane upon LTP induction, relayed downstream PIP3 effectors different PDK1 Akt.
