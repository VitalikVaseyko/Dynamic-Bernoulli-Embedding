 several years, scientists investigating cancer focused efforts elucidating mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis, aim finding way inhibit process. mechanisms, however, explain process cancer metastasis, explain cancer would metastasize first place. Cancer metastasizes due several factors, namely attack immune system, lack oxygen necessary nutrients, large amounts lactic acid produced glycolysis increased cell death. Therefore, majority presently available treatments cancer also bear potential induce metastasis. Thus, crucial medical practice minimize risk cancer metastasis time effective means inhibit process.
