 Atypical cases heritable hemolytic anemia noted conform clinically biochemically anemias pyruvatekinase (PK)-deficient type, except presence apparently adequate quantities erythrocyte-PK activity usual assay procedure. Investigations four anomalous cases, occurring two unrelated families, presented. Erythrocytes contained kinetically aberrant isozyme pyruvate kinase (PK(2)). Michaelis constants pathologic isozyme relative phosphoenolpyruvate 10-fold greater control values, kinetic abnormality evident second substrate, adenosine diphosphate. PK(2) exhibited pH optimum almost 1 U lower wild enzyme form (PK(1)). Significant differences also evident functional stabilities isozymes. Leukocytes unaffected. Family studies revealed paternal heterozygosity quantitative PK deficiency usual type. Clinically normal maternal relatives siblings demonstrated intermediate deviations erythrocyte-PK kinetics reaction characteristics compatible coexistence normal PK(1) kinetically abnormal PK(2). Hemolytic anemia propositi appeared require simultaneous inheritance gene governing PK(2) production presumed allele resulting quantitative PK deficiency. genetic defects traced three generations, defective gene instances apparently resident autosomes.A revision PK assay technique suggested, since catalytic inefficiency PK(2) manifested low substrate concentrations therefore undetectable relatively high phosphoenolpyruvate levels employed conventional assay.
