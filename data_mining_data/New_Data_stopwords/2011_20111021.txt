 normal heart responds changes metabolic milieu changing relative oxidation rates energy-providing substrates. hypothesized flexibility lost genetically obese rats fed high-caloric, high-fat "Western" diet (WD). Male Zucker obese (ZO) Zucker lean (ZL) rats fed either control WD composed 10 kcal% 45 kcal% fat, respectively, 7 28 days. Cardiac triglycerides mRNA transcript levels measured situ. Substrate oxidation rates cardiac power measured ex vivo. Hearts ZO rats fed WD 7 days showed decreased cardiac power increased cardiac triglyceride content, change oleate oxidation rates mRNA transcript levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), mitochondrial (MTE-1) cytosolic thioesterase-1(CTE-1). fed WD 28 days, ZO rats showed decrease cardiac power increase intramyocardial triglyceride levels compared ZO rats fed diet 7 days only, show significantly increased oleate oxidation rates transcript levels CTE-1, MTE-1, PDK-4, UCP-3. contrast, hearts ZL rats fed WD showed increased rates oleate oxidation increased transcript levels fatty acid responsive genes investigated, deterioration contractile function. conclude exposing genetic model obesity nutrient stress WD results early reversible loss metabolic flexibility heart accompanied contractile dysfunction.
