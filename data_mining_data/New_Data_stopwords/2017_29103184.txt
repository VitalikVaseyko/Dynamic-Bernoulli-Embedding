 Many aggressive metastatic cancer cell types show Warburg Effect; therefore, possible adaptation helping cancer cells rapidly divide utilize glycolytic intermediates biosynthesis ribose sugars (for nucleotide biosynthesis), fatty acid synthesis (lipids membrane synthesis), NADPH (cellular currency reductive biosynthesis) lactate. due course results decrease extracellular pH, leading acidic tumor micro-environment. EGFR crucial cell surface signaling receptor implicated cancer cell survival progression. warrants studying effect acidic micro-environmental conditions binding EGFR cell surface receptor one natural extracellular ligand EGF. exploited silico approaches: molecular dynamics simulation variable pH MM-GBSA free energy binding calculation method evaluate effect change microenvironmental pH. present study reported pH 6.6 EGFR binds EGF decreased free energy binding compared pH 7.2.
