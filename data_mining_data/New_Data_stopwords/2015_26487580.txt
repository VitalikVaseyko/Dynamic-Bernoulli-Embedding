 BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence shown cancer cell metabolism differs normal cells. However, clear whether different cancer types characterized specific metabolite profile. Therefore, study aims evaluate whether plasma metabolic phenotype allows discriminate lung breast cancer. PATIENTS METHODS: proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum plasma divided 110 integration regions, representing metabolic phenotype. integration regions reflect relative metabolite concentrations used train classification model discriminating 80 female breast cancer patients 54 female lung cancer patients, adenocarcinoma. validity model examined permutation testing classifying independent validation cohort 60 female breast cancer patients 81 male lung cancer patients, adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: model allows classify 99% breast cancer patients 93% lung cancer patients correctly area curve (AUC) 0.96 validated independent cohort sensitivity 89%, specificity 82% AUC 0.94. Decreased levels sphingomyelin phosphatidylcholine (phospholipids choline head group) phospholipids short, unsaturated fatty acid chains next increased levels phospholipids long, saturated fatty acid chains seem indicate cell membranes lung tumors rigid less sensitive lipid peroxidation. discriminating metabolites pointing pronounced response body Warburg effect lung cancer. CONCLUSION: Metabolic phenotyping plasma allows discriminate lung breast cancer, indicating metabolite profile reflects general cancer marker. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02362776.
