 Serum pyruvate-kinase (PK) creatine-kinase (CK) determinations carried sample 100 obligate carriers Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, 23 obligate carriers Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) gene, 50 normal adult control women. Blood samples collected subjects three times three independent occasions means three determinations considered PK CK activities statistical analysis. Discriminant analysis shown that, group carriers DMD gene, estimated misclassification frequencies (M.F.) using either serum CK, PK, enzymes were: 26.5% CK alone, 19.5% PK alone, 19% enzymes. group carriers BMD gene, estimated proportions M.F. were: 31.7% CK alone, 23.8% PK alone, 20.4% enzymes. concluded that, although proportion carries still remains undetected, use serum PK determinations enhances capability detecting carriers DMD BMD mainly compared serum CK alone.
