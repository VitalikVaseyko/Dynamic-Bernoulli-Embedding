 Neurons migrate long radial distance process known locomotion developing mammalian neocortex. locomotion, immature neurons undergo saltatory movement along radial glia fibers. molecular mechanisms regulate speed locomotion largely unknown. show serine/threonine kinase Akt activator phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) regulate speed locomotion mouse neocortical neurons cortical plate. Inactivation PDK1-Akt pathway impaired coordinated movement nucleus centrosome, microtubule-dependent process, neuronal migration. Moreover, PDK1-Akt pathway found control microtubules, likely regulating binding accessory proteins including dynactin subunit p150(glued) Consistent notion, found PDK1 regulates expression cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain light intermediate chain posttranscriptional level developing neocortex. results thus reveal essential role PDK1-Akt pathway regulation key step neuronal migration.
