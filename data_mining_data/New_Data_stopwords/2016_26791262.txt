 Nearly century ago, Otto Warburg made ground-breaking observation cancer cells, unlike normal cells, prefer seemingly inefficient mechanism glucose metabolism: aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon referred Warburg effect. finding rapidly proliferating cancer cells favors incomplete metabolism glucose, producing large amounts lactate opposed synthesizing ATP sustain cell growth, confounded scientists years. investigation metabolic phenotype cancer expanded understanding puzzling conundrum, opened new avenues development anti-cancer therapies. Enhanced glycolytic flux known allow increased synthesis intermediates sustaining anabolic pathways critical cancer cell growth. Alongside increase glycolysis, cancer cells transform mitochondria synthesis machines supported augmented glutaminolysis, supplying lipid production, amino acid synthesis, pentose phosphate pathways. Inhibition several key enzymes involved pathways demonstrated effectively obstruct cancer cell growth multiplication, sensitizing apoptosis. modulation various regulatory proteins involved metabolic processes central cancerous reprogramming metabolism. finding members one major protein families involved cell death regulation also aberrantly regulated cancers, Bcl-2 family proteins, also critical mediators metabolic pathways, provides strong evidence importance metabolic shift cancer cell survival. Targeting anti-apoptotic members Bcl-2 family proteins proving successful way selectively target cancer cells induce apoptosis. understanding cancer cells modify metabolic regulation increase channeling substrates biosynthesis allow discovery novel drug targets treat cancer. present review, focused recent developments therapeutic targeting different steps glycolysis, glutaminolysis metabolic regulatory role Bcl-2 family proteins.
