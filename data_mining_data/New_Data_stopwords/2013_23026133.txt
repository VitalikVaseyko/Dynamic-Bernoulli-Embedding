 Although considerable progress made toward understanding glioblastoma biology large-scale genetic protein expression analyses, little known underlying metabolic alterations promoting aggressive phenotype. conducted global metabolomic profiling patient-derived glioma specimens identified specific metabolic programs differentiating low- high-grade tumors, metabolic signature glioblastoma reflecting accelerated anabolic metabolism. coupled transcriptional profiles, identified metabolic phenotype mesenchymal subtype consist accumulation glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate decreased pyruvate kinase activity. Unbiased hierarchical clustering metabolomic profiles identified three subclasses, term energetic, anabolic, phospholipid catabolism prognostic relevance. studies represent first global metabolomic profiling glioma, offering previously undescribed window metabolic heterogeneity, provide requisite framework strategies designed target metabolism rapidly fatal malignancy.
