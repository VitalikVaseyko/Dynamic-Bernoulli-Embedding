 Current schizophrenia (SCZ) treatments fail treat broad range manifestations associated devastating disorder. Thus, new translational models reproduce core pathological features urgently needed facilitate novel drug discovery efforts. Here, report findings first comprehensive label-free liquid-mass spectrometry proteomic- proton nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic profiling rat frontal cortex chronic phencyclidine (PCP) intervention, induces SCZ-like symptoms. findings compared results proteomic profiling post-mortem prefrontal cortex SCZ patients relevant findings literature. approach, identified proteomic alterations glutamate-mediated Ca(2+) signaling (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, PPP3CA, VISL1), mitochondrial function (GOT2 PKLR), cytoskeletal remodeling (ARP3). Metabonomic profiling revealed changes levels glutamate, glutamine, glycine, pyruvate, Ca(2+) regulator taurine. Effects similar pathways also identified prefrontal cortex tissue human SCZ subjects. discovery similar identical proteomic metabonomic alterations chronic PCP rat model human brain indicates model recapitulates molecular alterations disease. knowledge may helpful understanding mechanisms underlying psychosis, which, turn, facilitate improved therapy drug discovery SCZ psychiatric diseases. importantly, molecular findings suggest combined use multiple models may required effective translation studies human SCZ.
