 rhizome Polygala tenuifolia WILLD (PT, family Polygalaceae) used traditional Chinese medicine inflammation, dementia, amnesia, neurasthenia cancer. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor(s) isolated PT using cytoprotective phenotype human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat-transduced CHME5 cells lipopolysaccharide/cycloheximide. isolated 9 constituents (1)-(9) ethyl acetate fraction PT, potently showed anti-cytoprotective effect HIV-1 TAT-transduced cells. them, (9R)-(-)-9-peptandecanolide (2), new compound named poligapolide, potently abolished cytoprotective effect HIV-1 Tat-transduced CHME5 cells. compound (2) inhibited phosphorylation Akt downstream molecule, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3beta) PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling pathway, suppress phosphorylation PI3K pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1. Based finding, poligapolide may abolish cytoprotective phenotype HIV-1 Tat-transduced CHME5 cells inhibiting Akt phosphorylation PI3K/Akt pathway.
