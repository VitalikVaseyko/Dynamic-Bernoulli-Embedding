 Microheterogeneity human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK-R) obtained isoelectric focusing (IEF) ultrathin polyacrylamide gels followed immunological visualization methods. Using method study whether polymorphismus PK-R occurs, could find deviations normal PK pattern case samples 100 German donors well lower number PK samples European, African Asian donors. Furthermore, compared IEF-pattern PK mutants normal new-borns foetal PK-samples. results show IEF-microheterogeneity PK may serve tool prenatal diagnosis case families effected severe PK deficiency.
