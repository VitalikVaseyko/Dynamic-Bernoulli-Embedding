 Loss transcription factor E2F1 elicits complex metabolic phenotype mice underscored reduced adiposity protection high fat diet-induced diabetes. Here, demonstrate E2F1 directly regulates gene encoding PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), key nutrient sensor modulator glucose homeostasis chronically elevated obesity diabetes acutely induced metabolic stress starvation fasting. show loss E2F1 vivo blunts PDK4 expression improves myocardial glucose oxidation. absence E2F1 also corresponds lower blood glucose levels, improved plasma lipid profile, increased sensitivity insulin stimulation. Consistently, enforced E2F1 expression up-regulates PDK4 levels suppresses glucose oxidation C(2)C(12) myoblasts. Furthermore, inactivation Rb, repressor E2F-dependent transcription, markedly induces PDK4 triggers enrichment E2F1 occupancy onto PDK4 promoter detected chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Two overlapping E2F binding sites identified promoter. Transactivation assays later verified E2F1 responsiveness promoter element C(2)C(12) myoblasts IMR90 fibroblasts, effect completely abrogated following mutation E2F sites. Taken together, data illustrate E2F1 mitogen directly regulates PDK4 levels influences cellular bioenergetics, namely mitochondrial glucose oxidation. results relevant pathophysiology chronic diseases like obesity diabetes, PDK4 dysregulated could implications pertinent etiology tumor metabolism, especially cancers Rb pathway defects.
