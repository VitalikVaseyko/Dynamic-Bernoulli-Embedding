 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency one common causes hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemias. investigated molecular alterations responsible erythrocyte pyruvate kinase enzyme deficiency four patients three unrelated Turkish families available pool 12 patients diagnosed pyruvate kinase deficiency one center. One novel missense mutation located cDNA nt 1623 G-->C (Lys541Asn), three previously described mutations 1456 C-->T (Arg486Trp), 1528 C-->T (Arg510End), 1675 C-->G (Arg559Gly) found associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. four mutations affect C-domain protein. three missense mutations result amino acid changes, cause alteration interaction subunits changing local distribution charges local conformational change protein structure. Arg510End mutation causes deletion terminal residues pyruvate kinase affecting integrity protein. study presents results first molecular study pyruvate kinase deficiency Turkey.
