 Surrounding environmental temperatures affect many aspects ectotherm physiology. Generally, organisms compensate one biological levels, allow temperature dictate processes enzyme activities kinetic effects reaction rates. digestion also alters physiological processes enzyme activities, study determined interacting effect thermal acclimation (8 20 degrees C) digesting single meal maximal enzyme activities three tissues goldfish (Carrassius auratus). Acclimation elevated temperatures decreased branchial Na(+), K(+), ATPase (NKA) activity. contrast, acclimation elevated temperatures effect citrate synthase (CS) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity tissue, renal NKA glutamine synthetase (GS) activities impacted. Warm water-acclimation exaggerated positive impact digestion intestinal branchial NKA activities intestinal GS activity only, digestion effect kidney. CS PK display intestinal zonation; however, distinct increase towards distal intestine NKA GS activities. Zonation NKA prominent warm-acclimated animals, acclimation temperature affect intestinal heterogeneity GS. Finally, impact tissue protein content enzyme activity discussed. conclude intestine gill warm-acclimated goldfish exhibited augmented capacity increasing several enzyme activities response digestion kidney unaffected thermal acclimation digesting single meal. However, amplified capacity ameliorated alterations tissue protein content. Amplified increases NKA activity may ultimately implications ATP demand tissues, increased GS activity may beneficially increase ammonia-detoxifying capacity intestine.
