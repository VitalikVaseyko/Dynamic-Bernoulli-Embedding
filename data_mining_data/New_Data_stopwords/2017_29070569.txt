 mouse cortical collecting duct cell (mpkCCD) instrumental cell model studying vasopressin-mediated aquaporin-2 regulation. cell line first developed Vandewalle's group transgenic mouse carrying transforming SV40 antigens driven pyruvate kinase promoter. immortalize cells, four hormone supplements (dexamethasone, epidermal growth factor, insulin, triiodothyronine) used enhance SV40 antigen expression; however, hormones appear various effects aquaporin-2 gene expression cells. Here, evaluated effects hormone supplement found dexamethasone enhanced vasopressin-induced aquaporin-2 gene expression mRNA protein levels dose- time-dependent manner, without affecting mRNA protein stability. effects dexamethasone attributed largely enhanced aquaporin-2 mRNA transcription association enhanced aquaporin-2 promoter activity. Dexamethasone affect vasopressin-regulated aquaporin-2 phosphorylation trafficking. summary, optimized conditions enhance vasopressin-induced endogenous aquaporin-2 gene expression mpkCCD cells. increasing amount aquaporin-2 protein cells, method facilitate study aquaporin-2 cell physiology regulated vasopressin.
