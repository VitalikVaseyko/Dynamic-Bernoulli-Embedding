 Escherichia coli phosphotransacetylase (Pta) catalyzes reversible interconversion acetyl-CoA acetyl phosphate. compounds critical E. coli metabolism, acetyl phosphate also involved regulation certain signal transduction pathways. Along acetate kinase, Pta plays important role acetate production E. coli grows rich medium; alternatively, involved acetate utilization high acetate concentrations. E. coli Pta composed three different domains, C-terminal one, called PTA_PTB, specific Ptas. present work, characterization E. coli Pta deletions N-terminal region performed. E. coli Pta acetyl phosphate-forming acetyl phosphate-consuming reactions display different maximum activities, differentially regulated pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate. compounds activate acetyl phosphate production, inhibit acetyl-CoA production, thus playing critical role defining rates two Pta reactions. characterization three truncated Ptas, display Pta activity, indicates substrate-binding site located C-terminal PTA_PTB domain. However, N-terminal P-loop NTPase domain involved expression maximal catalytic activity, stabilization hexameric native state, Pta activity regulation NADH, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate. truncated protein Pta-F3 able complement growth acetate E. coli mutant defective acetyl-CoA synthetase Pta, indicating that, although regulated metabolites, Pta C-terminal domain active vivo.
