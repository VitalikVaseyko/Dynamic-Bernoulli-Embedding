 allosteric regulation human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP; activator), ATP (inhibitor) alanine (Ala; inhibitor) monitored pH range 6.5 8.0 37 degrees C. function increasing pH, hL-PYK's affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), Fru-1,6-BP decreases, affinities ATP alanine slightly increases. pH 6.5, Fru-1,6-BP ATP elicit small allosteric impacts PEP affinity. pH increases, Fru-1,6-BP ATP elicit greater allosteric responses, response alanine relatively constant. Since magnitudes allosteric coupling ATP alanine inhibition different pH dependences magnitudes similar, inhibitors likely elicit responses using different molecular mechanisms. addition, results fail support general correlation pH dependent changes effector affinity pH dependent changes corresponding allosteric response.
