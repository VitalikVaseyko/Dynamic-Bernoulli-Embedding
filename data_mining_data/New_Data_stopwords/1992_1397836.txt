 Regulation gene expression specific nutrients become major frontier next generation nutrition scientists. techniques molecular biology allow us define nutrient needs, well outcomes nutrient excesses, terms events govern gene transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, mRNA translation. Evidence presented showing dietary constituents specifically modulate nuclear events governing gene transcription transcript processing. example, fatty acid synthase gene transcription inhibited specific polyunsaturated fatty acids; S14 pyruvate kinase genes contain specific carbohydrate response element; editing apo B-100 apo B-48 enhanced dietary carbohydrate. Nutrients iron glucose shown control mRNA stability translational rates certain transcripts regulating interaction cytosolic proteins specific nucleotide sequences. data review clearly demonstrate nutrients play active specific role governing expression select genes.
