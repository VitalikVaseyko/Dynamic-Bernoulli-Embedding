 BACKGROUND: Dimeric M2-pyruvate kinase (dM2-PK) overexpressed tumour cells rapid cell turnover. concentrations correlate well staging metastatic capability tumour cells. investigated use faecal dM2-PK noninvasive marker pouch inflammation (pouchitis) patients undergone restorative proctocolectomy. METHODS: Stool samples obtained 46 patients ulcerative colitis (UC) eight familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis defined using objective pouchitis score (OPS) pouch disease activity index. Faecal dM2-PK measured using quantitative sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay (ScheBo Biotech UK) results compared reciprocal faecal calprotectin concentrations. RESULTS: Using OPS, 6 46 patients UC pouchitis prepouch ileitis, 13 UC pouchitis alone, 27 non-inflamed UC pouch. One patient familial adenomatous polyposis pouchitis prepouch ileitis 7 non inflamed pouch. Respective median dM2-PK values (U/ml) five groups 49.5 (4.5-110), 12 (1-192.3), 2.2 (0.1-95.2), 19.5 1 (0.1-3). Statistically significant differences noted inflamed non inflamed pouches (P<0.0001). dM2-PK correlated significantly OPS, pouch disease activity index, endoscopic appearances, acute histological neutrophil scores (<0.0001). receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated sensitivity specificity 80 70.6%, respectively. dM2-PK faecal calprotectin concentrations correlated closely (r=0.87, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: study demonstrates faecal dM2-PK sensitive marker pouch inflammation concentration directly correlates objective markers pouchitis severity.
