 increasingly appreciated cancer cells must endowed specific metabolic adaptations support enhanced growth ensure survival stressful conditions. hand, many oncogenic mutations protooncogenes tumor suppressor genes directly cause metabolic derangements and, conversely, mutations enzymes found underlie several forms cancer. Thus, cancer-specific metabolic alterations considered among hallmarks malignant tumors. commonly, cancer cells exhibit enhanced glycolysis aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) alterations metabolism amino acids, glutamine, serine proline increasingly described important metabolic features selected tumor types. theory, deranged cancer-specific metabolic pathways may constitute novel therapeutic targets, although "metabolic" drug clinical use still represented enzyme L-asparaginase. However, increasing amount experimental evidence, well number trials progress, suggests metabolic drugs soon complement standard anti-cancer chemotherapy modern biological drugs.
