 Sarcandra glabra (Thunb.) Nakai traditional Chinese herbal medicine dietary supplement used treating several diseases. anti-diabetic activity S. glabra polysaccharides reported first time. vitro alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay indicated acidic S. glabra polysaccharide (SGP-2) IC50 87.06 +/- 11.76 mug mL(-1), much lower acarbose 338.90 +/- 46.86 mug mL(-1). Moreover, high fat diet (HFD) streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic mice administered SGP-2 (150, 300, 600 mg kg(-1) per day, respectively) 3 weeks. Postprandial blood glucose levels (PBGL), total cholesterol, triglyceride free fatty acid levels diabetic mice treated SGP-2 significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared model group. results oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index indicated SGP-2 could significantly improve (p < 0.05) insulin resistance glucose tolerance diabetic mice. Furthermore, activities antioxidant enzymes, hexokinase pyruvate kinase significantly increased (p < 0.05) SGP-2 treated groups. Thus proposed SGP-2 exerted hypoglycemic activity relieving insulin resistance, reducing postprandial blood glucose levels ameliorating lipid metabolism, well alleviating oxidative stress. data suggested SGP-2 anti-hyperglycemic activity could used medicinal preparations diabetes mellitus complications.
