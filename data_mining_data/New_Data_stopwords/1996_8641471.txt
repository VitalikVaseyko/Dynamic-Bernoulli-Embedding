 used subtractive hybridization isolate cDNAs overexpressed SK-PC-1 pancreas cancer cells. Forty-five independent clones corresponding 11 genes identified. expression cultured pancreas cancer cells, normal pancreas tissue, normal exocrine pancreas cultures examined Northern blotting. cDNA clones grouped two broad categories: (1) corresponding genes expressed high levels tumor cell lines primary cultures normal pancreas, normal tissue (i.e. thymosin beta4(3), cytokeratin 18, beta-actin, pyruvate kinase mitochondrial genes); (2) corresponding genes expressed high levels pancreas cancer cultures normal pancreas tissue cultured cells (i.e. tissue-type plasminogen activator cathepsin H). overexpression proteases pancreas cancers suggests play role aggressive biological behavior tumor.
