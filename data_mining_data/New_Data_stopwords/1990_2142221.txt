 Aluminum, abundant element earth's crust, implicated various pathological disorders low concentrations element recently shown inhibit brain glycolysis. However, despite fact aluminum accumulates high concentrations liver, potential effects metal hepatic intermediary metabolism explored. perfused livers untreated rats, maximal rates production lactate plus pyruvate (glycolysis) 93 +/- 15 mumols/g/hr. Glycolysis severely inhibited livers aluminum-treated rats (0.5 mg/kg, 6 hr experiment) maximal rates 23 +/- 4 mumols/g/hr. contrast, glucose production (glycogenolysis) hepatic oxygen uptake altered significantly prior treatment aluminum. livers fasted rats, pretreatment aluminum influence gluconeogenesis production lactate pyruvate fructose (5 mM). finding indicates pyruvate kinase inhibited aluminum implicates phosphofructokinase, hexokinase and/or glucokinase sites inhibitory effect aluminum glycolysis. liver homogenates untreated rats, increasing concentrations aluminum show appreciable effect hexokinase glucokinase activity cause progressive decreases phosphofructokinase activity. Therefore, aluminum-induced inhibition liver phosphofructokinase, important control site glycolytic pathway, likely responsible aluminum-induced inhibition hepatic glycolysis.
