 acute effects streptozotocin-induced diabetes several parameters glucose metabolism investigated rat peritoneal macrophages. cells accumulated vitro twofold fructose 2,6-bisphosphate presence increasing glucose concentration cells normal rats, increased production lactate observed. Phosphofructokinase-1, phosphofructokinase-2, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase activities increased cells diabetic rats compared normal rats. Transport 2-deoxy-D-glucose increased cells diabetic rats. [U-14C]Glucose incorporation glycogen also increased cells diabetics 14CO2 liberation less cells normal animals. Moreover, macrophages diabetics possess active pentose phosphate pathway (measure [1-14C]glucose oxidation) greater production superoxide anion (index activation macrophages) cells normal animals.
