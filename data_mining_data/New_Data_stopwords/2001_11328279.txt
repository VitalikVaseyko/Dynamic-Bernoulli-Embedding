 studied PK-LR gene 16 unrelated patients congenital haemolytic anaemia associated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency. Fifteen different mutations detected among 28 mutated alleles identified: two deletions (del 1010G, del 1042--1044); one four nucleotide duplication (nt 1515--1518, GGTC); one splice site [IVS6(-2)t]; nine missense (991A, 1003A, 1151T, 1160G, 1181T, 1181A, 1456T, 1483A, 1529A); two nonsense (721T, 1675T) mutations. Eight [del 1010G, del 1042--1044, dupl 1515--1518, IVS6(-2)t, 1003A, 1160G, 1181T, 1181A] novel. deletion 1042-1044 causes loss Lys 348. Deletion 1010G duplication 1515-1518 determine frameshift creation stop codon nucleotides 1019 1554 respectively. Mutation IVS6(-2)t leads alteration 5' 3' splice site consensus sequence; cDNA analysis shows 67-bp deletion first part exon 11 (del 1437--1503). four new missense mutations involve highly conserved amino acids. frequent mutation Italy would appear 1456T. Correlation made mutations, biochemical characteristics enzyme clinical course disease.
