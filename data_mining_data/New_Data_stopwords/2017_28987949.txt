 Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi), type Chinese materia medica, used treat acute chronic heart failure (HF) traditional Chinese medicine proven numerous animal studies. also well-known Zingiberis Rhizoma (Ganjiang) ineffective treatment HF, enhance anti-HF effect Fuzi. However, mechanism underlying compatibility still well investigated. investigate mechanism, model acute heart failure (AHF) SD rats induced propafenone hydrochloride established study. oral treatments Ganjiang, Fuzi combination two drugs rats AHF, heart function [e.g., heart rate (HR) maximal rising declining rate left ventricle pressure (+/-dp/dtmax)] serum indicators [e.g., brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) creatine kinase (CK)] measured, histopathological analysis heart also performed. biological mechanisms explored measuring protein expression level mitochondrial respiration chain complex (MRCC1-4) mRNA protein expression levels mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) upstream proteins, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter 1 mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter 2 (MICU1-2). expression levels key enzymes downstream tricarboxylic acid cycle, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), also measured. result, Ganjiang enhanced therapeutic effect Fuzi AHF raising HR +/-dp/dtmax; decreasing serum levels BNP, LDH CK; alleviating histological damage myocardial tissue compared treatments Ganjiang Fuzi alone. conclusion, enhancing effect Ganjiang anti-AHF function Fuzi treatment, potential mechanism effect may related mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway mediated MCU.
