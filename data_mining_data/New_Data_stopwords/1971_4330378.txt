 1. Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown anaerobically media different concentrations K(+) less 1mm. 3.2mm K(+) concentration limited growth rate yield. 2. Yeast extract essential maximum growth. yield cells medium contained 0.83mm-K(+) 30% yield 90mm-K(+). 3. end anaerobic growth cells grown 0.83mm-K(+) higher concentration oxidative enzymes cells grown 90mm-K(+). 4. cells grown anaerobically 0.83mm-K(+) could adapt aerobic conditions K(+) present adaptation medium, otherwise. 5. enzyme pattern yeast grown aerobically 0.83mm-K(+) similar anaerobically grown cells change markedly glucose consumed.
