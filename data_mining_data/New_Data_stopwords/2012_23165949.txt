 Tumorigenesis always concomitant microenvironmental alterations. tumor microenvironment heterogeneous complex milieu, exerts variety stresses tumor cells proliferation, survival, death. Recently, accumulated evidence revealed metabolic oxidative stresses play significant roles tumor development progression converge common autophagic pathway. Tumor cells display increased metabolic autonomy, hallmark exploitation aerobic glycolysis (termed Warburg effect), increased glucose consumption decreased oxidative phosphorylation support growth proliferation. characteristic renders cancer cells aggressive; devour tremendous amounts nutrients microenvironment result ever-growing appetite new tumor vessel formation release "waste," including key determinants cell fate like lactate reactive oxygen species (ROS). intracellular ROS level cancer cells also modulated variety stimuli tumor microenvironment, pro-growth pro-inflammatory factors. intracellular redox state serves double-edged sword tumor development progression: ROS overproduction results cytotoxic effects might lead apoptotic cell death, whereas certain level ROS act second-messenger regulation cellular processes cell survival, proliferation, metastasis. molecular mechanisms cancer cell responses metabolic oxidative stresses complex likely involve multiple molecules signaling pathways. addition, expression modification proteins metabolic oxidative stress challenge diverse different cancer cells endow different functions. Therefore, MS-based high-throughput platforms, proteomics, indispensable global analysis cancer cell responses metabolic oxidative stress. Herein, highlight recent advances understanding metabolic oxidative stresses associated tumor progression proteomics-based systems biology approaches.
