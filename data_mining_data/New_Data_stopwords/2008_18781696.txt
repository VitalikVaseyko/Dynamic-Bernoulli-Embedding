 Derivatives Escherichia coli C previously described succinate production combining deletion genes disrupt fermentation pathways alternative products (ldhA::FRT, adhE::FRT, ackA::FRT, focA-pflB::FRT, mgsA, poxB) growth-based selection increased ATP production. resulting strain, KJ073, produced 1.2 mol succinate per mol glucose mineral salts medium acetate, malate, pyruvate significant co-products. KJ073 improved removing residual recombinase sites (FRT sites) chromosomal regions gene deletion create strain devoid foreign DNA, strain KJ091(DeltaldhA DeltaadhE DeltaackA DeltafocA-pflB DeltamgsA DeltapoxB). KJ091 engineered improvements succinate production. Deletion threonine decarboxylase (tdcD; acetate kinase homologue) 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase (tdcE; pyruvate formate-lyase homologue) reduced acetate level 50% increased succinate yield (1.3 mol mol(-1) glucose) almost 10% compared KJ091 KJ073. Deletion two genes involved oxaloacetate metabolism, aspartate aminotransferase (aspC) NAD(+)-linked malic enzyme (sfcA) (KJ122) significantly increased succinate yield (1.5 mol mol(-1) glucose), succinate titer (700 mM), average volumetric productivity (0.9 g L(-1) h(-1)). Residual pyruvate acetate substantially reduced deletion pta encoding phosphotransacetylase produce KJ134 (DeltaldhA DeltaadhE DeltafocA-pflB DeltamgsA DeltapoxB DeltatdcDE DeltacitF DeltaaspC DeltasfcA Deltapta-ackA). Strains KJ122 KJ134 produced near theoretical yields succinate simple, anaerobic, batch fermentations using mineral salts medium. may useful biocatalysts commercial production succinate.
