 Detergent extraction brain slices mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells performed determine rates relative amounts extraction inositol versus glycolytic enzymes. two detergents, Triton X-100 Brij 58, led similar results extraction myo-inositol. extraction enzymes brain slices cells varied detergent. brain slices, buffered solution containing 0.2% detergent Brij 58 led extraction 85% inositol 3% aldolase 37% either lactate dehydrogenase triose phosphate isomerase extracted. contrast, 0.1% Triton X-100 isotonic phosphate-buffered saline, 70% inositol extracted, 33% aldolase 48% triose phosphate isomerase extracted. Lesser amounts aldolase glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase extracted glycolytic enzymes conditions, implying enzymes may interacting non-extractable subcellular components. 3T3 cells, detergents similar effectiveness inositol extraction. Triton X-100 caused 89% inositol released Brij 58 caused 84% released. enzymes, Brij 58 caused 15 38% extraction Triton X-100 caused 61 85% extraction different glycolytic enzymes. Thus Brij 58 effective Triton X-100 inositol extraction nearly effective glycolytic enzyme extraction. results demonstrate inositol leakage tissues cells better indicator detergent-mediated alterations membrane porosity glycolytic enzyme leakage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
