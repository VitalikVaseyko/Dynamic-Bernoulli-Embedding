 Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused mutations Frataxin (FXN). Loss FXN causes impaired mitochondrial function iron homeostasis. elevated production reactive oxygen species (ROS) previously proposed contribute pathogenesis FRDA. recently showed loss frataxin homolog (fh), Drosophila homolog FXN, causes ROS independent neurodegeneration flies (Chen et al., 2016). fh mutants, iron accumulation nervous system enhances synthesis sphingolipids, turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) trigger neurodegeneration adult photoreceptors. Here, show loss Fxn nervous system mice also activates iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating mechanism evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels PDK1 activity also increased hearts FRDA patients, suggesting similar pathway affected FRDA.
