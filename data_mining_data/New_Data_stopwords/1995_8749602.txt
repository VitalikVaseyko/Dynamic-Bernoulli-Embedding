 effectiveness gossypol antifertilizing agent due severe injuries death drug produces spermatozoa spermatides. Several vitro vivo studies shown spermatozoal lactic malic dehydrogenases inhibited gossypol; susceptible somatic enzymes. Notwithstanding, vivo effects somatic enzymes poorly analyzed. present study shows gossypol produce toxic effects eight erythrocytic enzymes male hamsters fed daily 20 mg gossypol/kg, 1, 3, 5 10 days. enzymatic activities analyzed were: adenylate kinase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose phosphoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglyceratokinase pyruvate kinase.
