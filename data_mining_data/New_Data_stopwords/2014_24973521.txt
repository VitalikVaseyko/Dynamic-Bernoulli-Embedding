 ATP plays central roles cancer metabolism Warburg effect. Intratumoral ATP concentrations 10(4) times higher interstitial ATP normal tissues. However, extracellular ATP known enter cancer cells. report human A549 lung cancer cells internalized extracellular ATP macropinocytosis demonstrated colocalization nonhydrolyzable fluorescent ATP macropinocytosis tracer high-molecular-weight dextran, well macropinocytosis inhibitor study. Extracellular ATP also induced increase intracellular ATP levels, without involving transcription translation significant levels, cancer cells' resistance ATP-competitor anticancer drugs, likely mechanism ATP internalization. findings, described first time, profound implications ATP-sharing among cancer cells tumors highlight novel anticancer target.
