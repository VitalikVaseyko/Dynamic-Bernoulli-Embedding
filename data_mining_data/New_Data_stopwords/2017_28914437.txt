 OBJECTIVE: assess beneficial potential ethanolic extract avocado fruit abnormal carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes hepatic renal tissues streptozotocin (STZ) induced hyperglycemic albino rats. METHODS: Twenty-four male albino rats randomly divided four groups six group simple random sampling method. Group 1 control rats; Group 2 STZ induced diabetic rats; Group 3 diabetic rats treated avocado fruit extract (AFE), 300 mg/kg aqueous suspension orally 30 days; Group 4 diabetic rats treated gliclazide (5 mg/kg) aqueous solution orally 30 days. rats fasted overnight sacrificed cervical dislocation blood collected various biochemical analysis excision hepatic kidney done histological analysis. Levels fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin glycosylated hemoglobin estimated. activities key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6- phosphatase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase assayed standard methods described methodology. RESULTS: Oral administration AFE significantly improved altered levels blood glucose, plasma insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, modulated activities carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes (P<0.05, respectively). glycogen content hepatic tissues significantly increased diabetic rats treated AFE (P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: AFE plays pivotal role maintain normoglycemia diabetes modulating activities carbohydrate metabolic enzymes.
