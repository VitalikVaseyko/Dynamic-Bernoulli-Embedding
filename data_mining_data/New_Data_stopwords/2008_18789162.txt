 BACKGROUND: Many cancers preferentially meet energy requirements glycolytic pathway rather via efficient oxidative phosphorylation pathway. thought important adaptation cancer malignancy. investigated whether use glycolysis energy production even presence oxygen (known Warburg effect) varied neuroblastoma cell lines without MYCN amplification (a key indicator poor disease outcome neuroblastoma). METHODS: examined ATP lactate production, oxygen consumption mitochondrial energisation status three neuroblastoma cell lines varying degrees MYCN amplification MYCN expression. RESULTS: found correlation MYCN expression Warburg effect cell lines investigated. CONCLUSION: results suggest preferential use glycolysis energy production MYCN expression may independent markers neuroblastoma malignancy vitro vivo.
