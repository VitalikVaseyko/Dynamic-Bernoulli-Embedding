 reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator system employed insulinoma INS-1 cells achieve controlled inducible expression hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1 alpha)-P291fsinsC, common mutation associated subtype 3 maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY3). Nuclear localized HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC protein exerts dominant-negative effects competing endogenous HNF1 alpha cognate DNA-binding site. HNF1 alpha controls multiple genes implicated pancreatic beta-cell function notably metabolism- secretion coupling. addition reduced expression genes encoding insulin, glucose transporter-2, L-pyruvate kinase, aldolase B 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase, induction HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC also significantly inhibits expression mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) E1 subunit mRNA protein. OGDH enzyme activity [(14)C]pyruvate oxidation also reduced. contrast, mRNA protein levels mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 dramatically increased HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC induction. predicted altered gene expression profile, HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC also inhibits insulin secretory responses glucose leucine, correlated impaired nutrient-evoked mitochondrial ATP production mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization. unprecedented results suggest molecular mechanism HNF1 alpha-P291fsinsC causing beta-cell dysfunction.
