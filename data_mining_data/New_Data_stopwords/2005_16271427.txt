 ecological impact study performed based situ biomarker assays waterflea Daphnia magna. effects metallurgic effluents energy metabolism, anti-oxidative metabolism DNA damage assessed caged daphnids 4-week study. situ survival reproduction studies demonstrated clear impact parameters organisms exposed polluted areas. downstream--sublethal--zone organisms disturbed within tolerance limits, resulting alterations energy metabolism. data suggest acclimation hypothesis, tested analysis energy metabolism resident species: isopods amphipods. organisms shifted decrease overall energy metabolism compared upstream region. change biochemical processes suggests selective advantage cope prevailing environmental conditions. addition, found clear genotoxic effects caused industrial discharges might correlate reduction (long-term) survival.
