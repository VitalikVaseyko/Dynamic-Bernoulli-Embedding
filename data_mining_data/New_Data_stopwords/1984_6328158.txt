 Effects TRH analog DN-1417 (gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-L-histidyl-L- prolinamide ) pentobarbital, alone combination, oxygen consumption cyclic AMP formation rat cerebral cortex slices investigated. oxygen consumption rat cerebral cortex slices measured Warburg apparatus, increased linearly time (0 60-min incubation 37C). Addition pentobarbital (1 7 x 10-4M) inhibited oxygen consumption, concentration-dependent manner, 45% control. concomitant application DN-1417 (10-5M) TRH (10-4M) pentobarbital (5 x 10-4M) led partial recovery pentobarbital effect. similar anti-pentobarbital effects observed addition carbachol (10-4M) dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10-3M), norepinephrine (10-4M) dopamine (10-4M). DN-1417, TRH, carbachol, norepinephrine dopamine 10-4M stimulated cyclic AMP formation cerebral cortex slices. Addition pentobarbital (1 7 x 10-4M) inhibited cyclic AMP formation, concentration-dependent manner. DN-1417, TRH carbachol 10-4M norepinephrine dopamine 10-4M significantly reversed reduction cyclic AMP formation induced pentobarbital (5 x 10-4M). Atropine (10-4M) almost completely abolished DN-1417-, TRH- carbachol-induced cyclic AMP formation presence absence pentobarbital.
