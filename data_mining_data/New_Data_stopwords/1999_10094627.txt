 Lactococcus lactis ccpA gene, encoding global regulatory protein CcpA, identified characterized. Northern blot primer extension analyses showed L. lactis ccpA gene constitutively transcribed promoter contain cre sequence. Inactivation ccpA gene resulted twofold reduction growth rate compared wild type glucose, sucrose fructose, growth galactose almost completely abolished. observed growth defects could complemented expression either L. lactis Bacillus subtilis ccpA gene. disruption ccpA gene reduced catabolite repression gal operon, contains cre site transcription start site encodes enzymes involved galactose catabolism. contrast, CcpA activates transcription cre-containing promoter las operon, encoding glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase L-lactate dehydrogenase, transcription level fourfold reduced ccpA mutant strain compared wild-type strain. lower activities pyruvate kinase L-lactate dehydrogenase ccpA mutant strain resulted production metabolites characteristic mixed-acid fermentation, whereas fermentation pattern wild-type strain essentially homolactic.
