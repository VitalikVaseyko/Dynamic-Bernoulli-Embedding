 Recent studies indicated increased expression M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) involved glycolysis tumor development. However, little known role PKM2 gastric cancer (GC). Therefore, examined expression function PKM2 human GC. evaluated PKM1 PKM2 expression quantitative RT-PCR gastric tissues 10 patients underwent gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection, 80 patients underwent gastrectomy, seven healthy volunteers, analyzed correlation clinicopathological variables. assess function PKM2, generated PKM2-knockdown GC cells, investigated phenotypic changes. Furthermore, examined induction PKM2 expression cytotoxin-associated gene (CagA), pathogenic factor Helicobacter pylori, using CagA-inducible GC cells. found PKM2 predominantly expressed GC lesions also normal gastric regions GC patients gastric mucosa healthy volunteers. PKM2 expression significantly higher carcinoma compared non-cancerous tissue associated venous invasion. Knockdown PKM2 GC cells caused significant decreases cellular proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth, sphere formation vitro, tumor growth liver metastasis vivo. serine concentration-dependent cell proliferation also inhibited PKM2 silencing. Furthermore, found PKM2 expression upregulated CagA way Erk pathway. results suggested enhanced PKM2 expression plays pivotal role carcinogenesis development GC part regulating cancer-specific metabolism.
