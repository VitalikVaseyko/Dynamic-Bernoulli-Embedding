 oocyte exists within mammalian follicle surrounded somatic cumulus cells. cumulus cells metabolize majority glucose within cumulus oocyte complex provide energy substrates intermediates pyruvate oocyte. insulin receptor present cumulus cells oocytes; however, unknown whether insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurs either cell type. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake thought unique adipocytes, skeletal cardiac muscle, blastocyst. Here, show first time many components required insulin signaling present cumulus cells oocytes. performed set experiments mouse cumulus cells oocytes human cumulus cells using nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose measure basal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. show insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurs compact expanded cumulus cells mice, well human cumulus cells. Oocytes, however, display insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake cumulus cells mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling shown inhibition insulin-stimulated glucose uptake Akt phosphorylation specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. test effect systemic vivo insulin resistance insulin sensitivity cumulus cell, cumulus cells high fat-fed, insulin-resistant mice women polycystic ovary syndrome examined. sets cells displayed blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. studies identify another tissue that, classical insulin-signaling pathway, demonstrates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, findings suggest insulin resistance occurs cells conditions systemic insulin resistance.
