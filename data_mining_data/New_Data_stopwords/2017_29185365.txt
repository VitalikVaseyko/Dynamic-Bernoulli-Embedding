 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) potential antitumor therapeutic target. study, designed synthesised series 2, 3-didithiocarbamate substituted naphthoquinones PKM2 inhibitors based lead compound 3k previously reported. Among them, compound 3f (IC50 = 1.05 +/- 0.17 microM) 3h (IC50 = 0.96 +/- 0.18 microM) exhibited potent inhibition PKM2, inhibitory activities superior compound 3k (IC50 = 2.95 +/- 0.53 microM) known PKM2 inhibitor shikonin (IC50 = 8.82 +/- 2.62 microM). addition, evaluated vitro antiproliferative effects target compounds using MTS assay. target compounds exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity IC50 values nanomolar concentrations HCT116, MCF7, Hela, H1299 B16 cells. small molecule PKM2 inhibitors provide candidate compounds cancer therapy, also offer tool probe biological effects PKM2 inhibition cancer cells.
