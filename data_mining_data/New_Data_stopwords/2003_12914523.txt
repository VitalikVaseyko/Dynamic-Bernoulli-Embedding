 study examined actions 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) progesterone regulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha PPARgamma) family nuclear transcription factors mRNA abundance key enzymes involved fat oxidation, skeletal muscle. Specifically, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT I), beta-3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (beta-HAD), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) examined. Sprague-Dawley rats ovariectomized treated placebo (Ovx), E(2), progesterone, hormones combination (E+P). Additionally, sham-operated rats treated placebo (Sham) serve controls. Hormone (or vehicle only) delivery via time release pellets inserted time surgery, 15 days prior analysis. E(2) treatment increased PPARalpha mRNA expression protein content (P<0.05), compared Ovx treatment. E(2) also resulted upregulated mRNA CPT PDK4 (P<0.05). PPARgamma mRNA expression also increased (P<0.05) E(2) treatment, although protein content remained unaltered. data demonstrate novel regulation E(2) PPARalpha genes encoding key proteins pivotal regulating skeletal muscle lipid oxidative flux.
