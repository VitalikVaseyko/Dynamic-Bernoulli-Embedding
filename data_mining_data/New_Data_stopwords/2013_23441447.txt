 OBJECTIVE: study effect silencing pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) gambogic acid (GA)-induced apoptosis human prostate cancer PC3 cells. METHODS: Three specific PKM2 siRNAs one negative control siRNA (si-NC) transfected PC3 cells. silencing effect PKM2 siRNAs determined real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) Western blot, effects PKM2 siRNA vitality apoptosis GA-stimulated PC3 cells detected MTT AO/EB double staining, respectively. mRNA protein levels c-myc cyclin D1 analyzed qRT-PCR Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: 3 PKM2 siRNAs effectively reduced mRNA protein expressions PKM2, PKM2 siRNA-1 exhibited strongest silencing effect. 24 h transfection, expression levels PKM2 mRNA protein reduced 70% 85%, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-four hours treatment GA (0.5 micromol/L) following transfection PKM2 siRNA-1 inhibited vitality PC3 cells 68%, increased apoptosis, significantly down-regulated mRNA protein levels c-myc (50% 35%) cyclin D1 (60% 20%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Inhibition PKM2 sensitized PC3 cells GA-induced apoptosis, suggesting PKM2 may potential therapeutic target sensitizing human prostate cancer GA.
