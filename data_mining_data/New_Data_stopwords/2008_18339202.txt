 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase important element flux control intermediate metabolism. catalyzes irreversible conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate allosteric control. Corynebacterium glutamicum, enzyme regarded promising target improved production lysine, one major amino acids animal nutrition. pyruvate kinase deficient strains required equimolar ratio two lysine precursors oxaloacetate pyruvate achieved concerted action phosphotransferase system (PTS) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), whereby reduced amount carbon may lost CO2 due reduced flux tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. previous studies, deletion pyruvate kinase lysine-producing C. glutamicum, however, yield clear picture exact metabolic consequences fully understood. RESULTS: work, deletion pyk gene, encoding pyruvate kinase, carried lysine-producing strain C. glutamicum lysCfbr, expressing feedback resistant aspartokinase, investigate cellular response deletion central glycolytic enzyme. Pyk deletion achieved allelic replacement, verified PCR analysis lack vitro enzyme activity. deletion mutant showed overall growth behavior (specific growth rate, glucose uptake rate, biomass yield) similar parent strain, differed slightly reduced lysine formation, increased formation overflow metabolites dihydroxyacetone glycerol metabolic fluxes around pyruvate node. latter involved flux shift pyruvate carboxylase (PC) PEPC, cell maintained anaplerotic supply TCA cycle. created metabolic by-pass PEP pyruvate via malic enzyme demonstrating contribution metabolic flexibility C. glutamicum glucose. CONCLUSION: metabolic flux analysis performed illustrates high flexibility metabolic network C. glutamicum compensate external perturbation. organism could almost maintain growth production performance local redirection metabolic flux, thereby fulfilling anabolic catabolic needs. formation undesired overflow metabolites dihydroxyacetone glycerol, deletion mutant, however, indicates limiting capacity metabolism down-stream common precursor glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate opens possibilities strain engineering.
