 Oncogene addiction describes cancer cells exhibit dependence single oncogenes escape apoptosis senescence. oncogene addiction constitutes basis new cancer treatment strategies targeting individual kinases pathways activated oncogenic mutations, biochemical basis addiction largely unknown. provide evidence metabolic rationale behind addiction (V600E)BRAF two malignant melanoma cell lines. cell lines display striking addiction glycolysis due underlying dysfunction oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Notably, even minor reductions glycolytic activity lead increased OXPHOS activity (reversed Warburg effect), however mitochondria unable sustain ATP production. show (V600E)BRAF upholds activity glycolysis therefore addiction glycolysis de facto becomes addiction (V600E)BRAF. Finally, senescence response associated inhibition (V600E)BRAF rescued overexpression glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), providing direct evidence oncogene addiction rests metabolic foundation.
