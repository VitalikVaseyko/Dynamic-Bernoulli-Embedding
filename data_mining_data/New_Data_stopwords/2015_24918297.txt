 Inflammation oxidative stress play crucial roles etiology type 2 diabetes mellitus. study, examined anti-diabetic effects triterpenoid saponins extracted Stauntonia chinensis stimulating glucose uptake insulin-resistant human HepG2 cells. results showed saponin 6 significantly increased glucose uptake glucose catabolism. Saponin 6 also enhanced phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activated insulin receptor (IR)/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Therefore, results suggest saponins S. chinensis improve glucose uptake catabolism hepatic cells stimulating AMPK IR/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. results also imply saponins S. chinensis enhance glucose uptake insulin sensitivity, representing promising treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus.
