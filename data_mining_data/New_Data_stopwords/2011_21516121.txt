 recently reported shikonin analogs class necroptotic inducers could bypass cancer drug resistance. However, molecular targets shikonin known. Here, showed shikonin analogs inhibitors tumor-specific pyruvate kinase-M2 (PKM2), among shikonin enantiomeric isomer alkannin potent showed promising selectivity, is, shikonin alkannin concentrations resulted 50% inhibition PKM2 activity inhibit PKM1 pyruvate kinase-L (PKL). Shikonin alkannin significantly inhibited glycolytic rate, manifested cellular lactate production glucose consumption drug-sensitive resistant cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/Adr, MCF-7/Bcl-2, MCF-7/Bcl-x(L) A549) primarily express PKM2. HeLa cells transfected PKM1 showed reduced sensitivity shikonin- alkannin-induced cell death. best knowledge, shikonin alkannin potent specific inhibitors PKM2 reported far. PKM2 universally expresses cancer cells dictates last rate-limiting step glycolysis vital cancer cell proliferation survival, enantiomeric shikonin alkannin may potential future clinical application.
