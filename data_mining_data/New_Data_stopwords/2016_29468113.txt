 (13)C labeling experiments aerobic glucose limited cultures Saccharomyces cerevisiae four different growth rates (0.054; 0.101, 0.207, 0.307 h(-1)) used calculating fluxes include intracellular cycles (e.g., storage carbohydrate cycles, exchange fluxes amino acids), rearranged depending growth rate. low growth rates impact storage carbohydrate recycle relatively significant high growth rates due higher concentration materials cell (up 560-fold) higher fluxes relative glucose uptake rate (up 16%). Experimental observations suggest glucose exported extracellular space, source related storage carbohydrates, likely via export subsequent extracellular breakdown trehalose. hypothesis strongly supported (13)C-labeling experimental data, measured extracellular trehalose, corresponding flux estimations.
