 fighting cancer, knowledge metabolism always important. Today, matters ever. restricted cataloging cancer genomes quite unlikely achieve task curing cancer, unless integrated metabolic networks respond influence constantly evolving cancer stem cell (CSC) cellular states. genomic era carcinogenesis pushed 1920s Otto Warburg's metabolic cancer hypothesis obscurity decades, recent studies begin support new developing paradigm, molecular logic behind conversion non-CSCs CSCs better understood terms "metabolic facilitators" "metabolic impediments" operate proximate openings roadblocks, respectively, transcriptional events signal transduction programs ultimately orchestrate intrinsic and/or microenvironmental paths CSC cellular states. propose profound understanding human carcinomas install proper "Warburg effect version 2.0" allowing "run" CSCs' "software" programs guide new era metabolo-genomic-personalized cancer medicine. viewing metabolic reprogramming CSCs essential characteristic allows dynamic, multidimensional evolving cancer populations compete successfully expansion organism, argue CSCs bioenergetics might another cancer hallmark. definitive understanding metabolic reprogramming CSCs may complement extent replace, 30-y-old paradigm targeting oncogenes treat human carcinomas, possible metabolically create non-permissive "hostile" metabotypes prevent occurrence CSC cellular states tumor- metastasis-initiating capacity.
