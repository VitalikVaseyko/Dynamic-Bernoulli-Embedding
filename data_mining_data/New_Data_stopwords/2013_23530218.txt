 show M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (M2PYK) exists equilibrium monomers tetramers regulated allosteric binding naturally occurring small-molecule metabolites. Phenylalanine stabilizes inactive T-state tetrameric conformer inhibits M2PYK IC50 value 0.24 mM, whereas thyroid hormone (triiodo-L-thyronine, T3) stabilizes inactive monomeric form M2PYK IC50 78 nM. allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate [F16BP, AC50 (concentration gives 50% activation) 7 muM] shifts equilibrium tetrameric active R-state, similar activity constitutively fully active isoform M1PYK. Proliferation assays using HCT-116 cells showed addition inhibitors phenylalanine T3 increased cell proliferation, whereas addition activator F16BP reduced proliferation. F16BP abrogates inhibitory effect phenylalanine T3, highlighting dominant role M2PYK allosteric activation regulation cancer proliferation. X-ray structures show constitutively fully active M1PYK F16BP-bound M2PYK R-state conformation lysine dimer-interface acting peg hole, locking active tetramer conformation. Binding phenylalanine allosteric pocket induces 13 degrees rotation protomers, destroying peg-in-hole R-state interface. distinct T-state tetramer stabilized flipped Trp/Arg side chains stack across dimer interface.
