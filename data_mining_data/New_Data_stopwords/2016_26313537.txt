 Here, assess physiological effects induced environmental concentrations pesticides Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Oysters exposed 14 trace levels metconazole (0.2 2 mug/L), isoproturon (0.1 1 mug/L), mixture (0.2 0.1 mug/L, respectively). Exposure trace levels pesticides effect filtration rate, growth, energy reserves oysters. However, oysters exposed metconazole isoproturon showed overactivation sensing-kinase AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha), key enzyme involved energy metabolism particularly glycolysis. meantime, exposed oysters showed decrease hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities, whereas 2-DE proteomic revealed fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F-1,6-BP), key enzyme gluconeogenesis, up-regulated. Activities antioxidant enzymes higher oysters exposed highest pesticide concentrations. pesticides enhanced superoxide dismutase activity oysters. Isoproturon enhanced catalase activity, metconazole enhanced peroxiredoxin activity. Overall, results show environmental concentrations metconazole isoproturon induced subtle changes energy antioxidant metabolisms oysters.
