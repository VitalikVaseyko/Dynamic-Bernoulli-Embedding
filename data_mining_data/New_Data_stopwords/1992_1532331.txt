 common characteristic tumor cells, well normal proliferating cells G1-phase cell cycle, one finds constitutive high levels glycolytic metabolites arising glucose 6-phosphate phosphoenolpyruvate. Thus, phosphometabolites fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, ribose 5-P, P-ribose-PP, NAD, GTP, CTO, UTP, UDP-glucose, glycerol 3-P, glycerol phosphocholine glycerol phosphoethanolamine useful 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection solid tumors animals man. expansion phosphometabolites achieved tumor formation result reductions levels enzymes degrading phosphometabolites, owing decline glycerol 3-P hydrogen shuttle, consequence alterations glycolytic isoenzyme equipment. Tumor cells typically express particular isoenzyme pyruvate kinase called type M2 (K) high levels. isoenzyme subject complex regulation amino acids, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, hormonal- oncogene-dependent phosphorylation. Pyruvate kinase type M2 substrate oncogene encoded PP60v-src-tyrosine kinase. drastic decrease affinity substrate phosphoenolpyruvate found transformation src-oncogene explained consequence phosphorylation pyruvate kinase serine tyrosine. phosphorylations induce breakdown tetrameric pyruvate kinase trimeric dimeric forms. Unlike tetrameric form, dimeric form low affinity phosphoenolpyruvate. Partial inactivation pyruvate kinase enolase one hand, hyperactivation hexokinase phosphofructokinase hand, lead expansion metabolites. metabolites attain high levels, thereby assuring sufficient supply metabolites RNA, DNA, lipid, complex carbohydrate synthesis, cell proliferation proceed. accumulation metabolites G1-phase cells termed "metabolic budget system" senses actual nutrient levels, also supply period time. Monoclonal antibodies specific dimeric form pyruvate kinase type M2 used immunohistological detection tumor cells. amount dimeric form tumor cells closely correlates degree malignancy used nonspecific detection tumors based assays performed patient's plasma.
