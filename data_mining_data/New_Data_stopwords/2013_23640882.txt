 Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) physiological regulator glucose homeostasis adiposity drug target treatment obesity diabetes. identify pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) novel PTP1B substrate adipocytes. PTP1B deficiency leads increased PKM2 total tyrosine Tyr(105) phosphorylation cultured adipocytes vivo. Substrate trapping mutagenesis studies identify PKM2 Tyr-105 Tyr-148 key sites mediate PTP1B-PKM2 interaction. addition, vitro analyses illustrate direct effect Tyr-105 phosphorylation PKM2 activity adipocytes. Importantly, PTP1B pharmacological inhibition increased PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation decreased PKM2 activity. Moreover, PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation regulated nutritionally, decreasing adipose tissue depots high-fat feeding. Further, decreased PKM2 Tyr-105 phosphorylation correlates development glucose intolerance insulin resistance rodents, non-human primates, humans. Together, findings identify PKM2 novel substrate PTP1B provide new insights regulation adipose PKM2 activity.
