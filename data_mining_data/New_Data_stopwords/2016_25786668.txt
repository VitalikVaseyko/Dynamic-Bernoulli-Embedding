 NEW FINDINGS: central question study? aim determine whether accumulation ceramide contributes skeletal muscle insulin resistance JCR obese rat. main finding importance? main new finding ceramides accumulate slow-twitch skeletal muscle JCR obese rat reducing ceramide content muscle type inhibition serine palmitoyl transferase-1 halts progression insulin resistance rat model predisposed early development type 2 diabetes. findings highlight importance assessing insulin signalling/sensitivity lipid intermediate accumulation different muscle fibre types. postulated insulin resistance results accumulation cytosolic lipid metabolites (i.e. diacylglycerol/ceramide) impede insulin signalling impair glucose homeostasis. De novo ceramide synthesis catalysed serine palmitoyl transferase-1. aim determine whether de novo ceramide synthesis plays role development insulin resistance JCR:LA-cp obese rat. Ten-week-old JCR:LA-cp obese rats supplemented either vehicle serine palmitoyl transferase-1 inhibitor l-cycloserine (360 mg l(-1) ) drinking water 2 week period, glycaemia assessed meal tolerance testing. Treatment JCR:LA-cp obese rats l-cycloserine improved plasma glucose insulin levels meal tolerance test. Examination muscle lipid metabolites protein phosphorylation patterns revealed differential signatures slow-twitch (soleus) versus fast-twitch muscle (gastrocnemius), ceramide levels increased soleus gastrocnemius muscles JCR:LA-cp obese rats. Likewise, improved glycaemia l-cycloserine-treated JCR:LA-cp obese rats associated enhanced Akt pyruvate dehydrogenase signalling soleus gastrocnemius muscles, probably result l-cycloserine reducing elevated ceramides muscle type. Potential mechanisms ceramide-mediated insulin resistance involve activation atypical protein kinase Czeta/lambda protein phosphatase 2A; however, neither altered muscles JCR:LA-cp obese rats. results suggest key role ceramide development insulin resistance JCR:LA-cp obese rat, supporting serine palmitoyl transferase-1 inhibition novel target treatment obesity-associated insulin resistance.
