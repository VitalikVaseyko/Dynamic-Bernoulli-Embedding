 role thyroid hormones metabolic adaptation starvation investigated vivo. Glucose production, measured tracer technique, enhanced hyperthyroid (185%) reduced hypothyroid (39%) 48-hour starved rats (euthyroid control = 100%). Urinary nitrogen excretion increased hyperthyroidism (132%) decreased hypothyroidism (70%). Compared euthyroid controls (=100%) significant alterations following regulatory parameters hepatic gluconeogenesis observed: 1) tissue cAMP (124%/91%) protein kinase activation (132%/90%), corresponding crossover pyruvate P-enolpyruvate (-/+/+/-); 2) pyruvate carboxylase (165%/60%), P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (140%/82%) fructose-1.6-bis-P-phosphatase activity (99%/61%), 3) tissue content glucogenic amino acids: alanine (187%/66%) glutamate (187%/88%), aspartate (179%/68%) glutamate (137%/75%), well oxaloacetate (254%/66%) malate (164%/104%). observed alterations hepatic oligomycine-sensitive oxygen consumption hyper- (161%) hypothyroidism (51%) related measured concentration intermediates citric acid cycle, energy state mitochondrial redox state. summary, different rates hepatic glucose production hyper- hypothyroid starved rats observed vivo ascribed 1) cAMP content, 2) gluconeogenic key enzyme activities, 3) glucogenic precursor supply 4) cofactor (ATP) availability.
