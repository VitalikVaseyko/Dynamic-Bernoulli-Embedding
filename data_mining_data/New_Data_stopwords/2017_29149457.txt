 Emerging studies suggested Hippo pathway involved tumorigenesis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, key regulator Hippo pathway liver tumor metabolic reprogramming remains elusive. Here, provide evidence support high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), chromosomal protein, plays role regulation Hippo pathway liver tumorigenesis. Cre/loxP recombination-mediated HMGB1 depletion hepatocytes blocks diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer initiation mice, whereas shRNA-mediated gene silencing HMGB1 inhibits HCC cell proliferation. Mechanistically, binding HMGB1 GA-binding protein alpha (GABPalpha) promotes expression yes-associated protein (YAP), major downstream effector Hippo pathway, contributes liver tumorigenesis inducing hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha)-dependent aerobic glycolysis. Like wild type YAP-cDNA, YAP-5SA-S94A restore HIF1alpha DNA binding activity, glycolysis-associated gene expression, HIF1alpha-YAP complex formation YAP-knockdown HCC cell lines. contrast, verteporfin, reagent targeting interface YAP TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD), ability block YAP-HIF1alpha complex formation. Notably, genetic pharmacological inhibition HMGB1-YAP-HIF1alpha pathway confers protection excessive glycolysis tumor growth mice. CONCLUSION: findings uncover HMGB1 plays novel role modulating YAP-dependent HIF1alpha pathway sheds light development metabolism-targeting therapeutics HCC chemoprevention. article protected copyright. rights reserved.
