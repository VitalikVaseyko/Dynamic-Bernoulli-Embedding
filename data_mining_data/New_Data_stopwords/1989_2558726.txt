 pyruvate kinase reaction occurs separate phosphate- proton-transfer stages: (formula; see text) K+, Mg2+, Mg.ADP known required phosphoryl transfer step, K+ Mg2+ allosteric stimulation MgATP important proton transfer. paper uses isotope trapping method 3H-labeled water identify proton donor determine sequence catalytic cycle generated. enzyme allowed exchange briefly 3H2O (pulse phase) diluted mixture containing PEP, ADP, cofactor K+, Mg2+, Co2+ D2O (chase phase), amount [3H]pyruvate formed great excess amount expected steady-state catalysis diluted 3H-labeled water. K+, Mg2+, ADP pH 6-9.5 pulse phase, limit 1.25 enzyme equiv 3H trapped. concentration PEP required half-maximum trapping 14-fold greater steady-state Km. Therefore, rate constant dissociation donor proton estimated 14 times steady-state rate [3H]pyruvate formation, approximately 109 s-1, 1500 s-1. pD 6.4, Mg2+ ADP required chase, indicating ADP pulse bound tightly enough used chase. pD 9.4, ADP required chase, Mg2+ Co2+, making possible limit chase one turnover hybrid labeled complexes E.K.Mg.CoADP E.K.Co.MgADP PEP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
