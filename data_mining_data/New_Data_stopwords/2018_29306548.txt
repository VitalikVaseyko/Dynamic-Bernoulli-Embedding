 evolution life extreme hypoxic environments oxygen-rich atmosphere progressively selected successful metabolic, enzymatic bioenergetic networks myriad organisms survive extreme environmental conditions. two lethal environments anoxia/high O2, cells developed survival strategies expression transcriptional factors ATF4, HIF1 NRF2. Cancer cells largely exploit factors thrive resist therapies. review, report discuss potential therapeutic benefit disrupting major Myc/Hypoxia-induced metabolic pathway, also known fermentative glycolysis "Warburg effect", aggressive cancer cell lines. three examples genetic disruption pathway: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA B) lactic acid transporters (MCT1, MCT4), illuminate cancer cells exploit metabolic plasticity survive metabolic energetic blockade arrest growth. context NRF2 contribution OXPHOS re-activation show discuss how, disruption cystine transporter xCT (SLC7A11), exploit acute lethal phospholipid peroxidation pathway induce cancer cell death 'ferroptosis'.
