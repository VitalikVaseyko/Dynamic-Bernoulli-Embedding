 Asymmetry cow affects ovarian function pregnancy. work studied ovarian uterine asymmetry. Synchronised animals, vitro-produced embryos (n=30-60) transferred Day 5 uterine horn ipsilateral corpus luteum (CL), flushed Day 8. Ovulatory follicle diameter, oestrus response total protein flushed differ sides. However, corpus luteum right ovary led plasma progesterone concentrations higher present left ovary. Fewer embryos recovered left right horn. Among 60 uterine proteins identified difference gel electrophoresis, relative abundance nine (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long chain; twinfilin, actin-binding protein, homologue 1; enolase 1; pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (rabbit); complement factor B Bb fragment ; albumin; fibrinogen gamma-B chain; ezrin differed (P<0.05) horns. Glucose concentration higher, fructose concentration lower, left horn. subsequent field trial, pregnancy rates embryo transfer differ horns (51.0+/-3.6, right vs 53.2+/-4.7, left). However, Day 7 blood progesterone concentrations differed (P=0.018) pregnant open animals left (15.9+/-1.7 vs 8.3+/-1.2) right horn (12.4+/-1.3 vs 12.4+/-1.2). Progesterone effects independent CL quality (P=0.55). Bilateral genital tract asymmetry cow affects progesterone, proteins hexoses without altering pregnancy rates.
