 past two years seen phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) move seen potential targets chemotherapeutics, one them--PI3Kalpha--being generally accepted validated. huge amount work indicated important role PI3Ks tumour progression and, particularly, control proliferation, survival regulation potential oncogene PKB. links strengthened studies showing tumour suppressor, PTEN, antagonist PI3K signalling somatic mutations p110alpha (PIK3CA) present variety cancers. know three frequent mutations cancer constitutively activate PI3Kalpha and, expressed cells, drive oncogenic transformation chronic activation downstream signalling molecules PKB, S6K 4E bp1 commonly seen cancer cells. large body research cellular roles PI3Ks also validated potential foci cancer chemotherapy, several additional PI3K effectors controlling cell proliferation apoptosis described. Furthermore, molecules important processes metastasis, development multi-drug resistance, 'Warburg effect', angiogenesis cell growth (i.e. distinct proliferation) found depend upon, driven by, PI3K activity.
