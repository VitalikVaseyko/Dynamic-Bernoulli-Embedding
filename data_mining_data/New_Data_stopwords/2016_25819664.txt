 increasing number data support involvement disturbances glucose metabolism pathogenesis depression. previously reported glucose glycogen concentrations brain structures important depression higher prenatal stress model depression compared control animals. marked rise concentrations carbohydrates glucose transporters evident prenatally stressed animals subjected acute stress glucose loading adulthood. determine whether elevated levels brain glucose associated change metabolism model, assessed key glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase), products glycolysis, i.e., pyruvate lactate, two selected enzymes tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) hippocampus frontal cortex. Additionally, assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, key enzyme pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Prenatal stress increased levels phosphofructokinase, important glycolytic enzyme, hippocampus frontal cortex. However, prenatal stress effect hexokinase pyruvate kinase levels. lactate concentration elevated prenatally stressed rats frontal cortex, pyruvate levels remained unchanged. Among tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, prenatal stress decreased level pyruvate dehydrogenase hippocampus, effect alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Like case glucose transporters, also present study, differences markers glucose metabolism control animals subjected prenatal stress observed basal conditions rats subjected acute stress glucose load adulthood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity reduced prenatal stress found even higher animals exposed experimental conditions, i.e., prenatal stress, acute stress, glucose administration. data indicate glycolysis increased Krebs cycle decreased brain prenatal stress animal model depression.
