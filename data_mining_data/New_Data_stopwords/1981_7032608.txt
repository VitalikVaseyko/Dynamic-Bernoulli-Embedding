 effects insulin tyroxin activities pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate-lyase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylase), lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate carrier rat liver investigated. Insulin increased activities enzymes tested. total activity lactate dehydrogenase altered thereby; however, redistribution isoenzymes towards increase LDH1 decrease LDH4 observed. increase pyruvate kinase, ATP-citrate-lyase NADP-malate dehydrogenase activities took place, actinomycin injected simultaneously insulin. Tyroxin decreased activities pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase ATP-citrate-lyase increased NADP-malate dehydrogenase. role induction insulin inhibition tyroxin enzyme activity citrate-pyruvate system CoASA transport lipogenesis control rat liver discussed. assumed lipogenesis stimulated insulin, malate oxidized malate dehydrogenase reaction formed cytoplasm, tyroxin action produced mitochondria.
