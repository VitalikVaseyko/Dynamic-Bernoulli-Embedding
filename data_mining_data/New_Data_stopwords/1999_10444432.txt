 characterized effects calorie restriction (CR) expression key glycolytic, gluconeogenic, nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes mice. gluconeogenic enzymes investigated, liver glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA increased 1.7- 2. 3-fold young old CR mice. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA activity increased 2.5- 1.7-fold old CR mice. key glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase mRNA activity decreased approximately 60% CR mice. Hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 pyruvate dehydrogenase mRNA decreased 10-20% CR mice. genes detoxify ammonia generated protein catabolism, hepatic glutaminase, carbamyl phosphate synthase I, tyrosine aminotransferase mRNAs increased 2.4-, 1.8-, 1.8-fold CR, respectively. Muscle glutamine synthetase mRNA increased 1.3- 2. 1-fold young old CR mice. Hepatic glutamine synthetase mRNA activity decreased 38% CR mice. CR-induced changes consistent studies suggesting CR may decrease enzymatic capacity glycolysis increase enzymatic capacity hepatic gluconeogenesis disposal byproducts muscle protein catabolism.
