 Enzyme activity lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, cholinesterase, alkaline, acid prostatic phosphatase aldolase studied total 213 subjects, 97 good health, 63 bone tumors 53 suffered osteomyelitis. activities majority enzymes found become significantly changed comparison norm. patient groups, striking differences noted osteomyelitis. However, enzymatic activity alone allow differentiate group bone tumors osteomyelitis, differences two groups significance one enzymes followed.
