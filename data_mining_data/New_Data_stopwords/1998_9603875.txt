 Pyruvate, precursor several amino acids, synthesized phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. Nevertheless, pyk1 pyk2 mutants Saccharomyces cerevisiae devoid pyruvate kinase activity grew normally ethanol defined media, indicating presence alternative route pyruvate synthesis. candidate role malic enzyme, catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation malate pyruvate. Disruption open reading frame YKL029c, homologous malic enzyme genes organisms, abolished malic enzyme activity extracts glucose-grown cells. Conversely, overexpression YKL029c/MAE1 MET25 promoter resulted 33-fold increase malic enzyme activity. Growth studies mutants demonstrated presence either Pyk1p Mae1p required growth ethanol. Mutants lacking enzymes could rescued addition alanine pyruvate ethanol cultures. Disruption MAE1 alone result clear phenotype. Regulation MAE1 studied determining enzyme activities MAE1 mRNA levels wild-type cultures measuring beta-galactosidase activities strain carrying MAE1::lacZ fusion. shake flask cultures carbon-limited chemostat cultures, MAE1 constitutively expressed. three- fourfold induction observed anaerobic growth glucose. Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated malic enzyme S. cerevisiae mitochondrial enzyme. regulation localization suggest role provision intramitochondrial NADPH pyruvate anaerobic growth conditions. However, since null mutants could still grow anaerobically, function apparently essential.
