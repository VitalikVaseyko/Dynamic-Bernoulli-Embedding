 Cancer metabolism characterized increased macromolecular syntheses coordinated increases energy substrate metabolism. observation cancer cells produce lactate environment oxygen sufficiency (aerobic glycolysis) central theme cancer metabolism known Warburg effect. Aerobic glycolysis cancer metabolism accompanied increased pentose cycle anaplerotic activities producing energy substrates macromolecular synthesis. processes coordinated poorly understood. Recent advances focused molecular regulation cancer metabolism oncogenes tumor suppressor genes regulate numerous enzymatic steps central glucose metabolism. past decade, new insights cancer metabolism emerged application stable isotopes particularly (13)C carbon tracing. studies provided new evidence system-wide changes cancer metabolism response chemotherapy. Interestingly, experiments using metabolic inhibitors individual biochemical pathways demonstrate similar system-wide effects cancer metabolism targeted therapies. Since biochemical reactions Warburg effect place competing demands available precursors, high energy phosphates reducing equivalents, cancer metabolic system must fulfill condition balance flux (homeostasis). review, functions pentose cycle tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle cancer metabolism analyzed balance flux point view. Anticancer treatments target molecular signaling pathways inhibit metabolism alter invasive proliferative behavior cancer cells effects balance flux (homeostasis) cancer metabolic phenotype.
