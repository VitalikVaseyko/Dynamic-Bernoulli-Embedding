 glycolytic model system consisting enzymes phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) analyzed subject periodic substrate addition. calculations performed using detailed rate laws derived enzymes Escherichia coli. Due linear relationships metabolite concentrations, numerical solutions displayed inside trapezium, concentrations four different metabolites indicated along trapezium edges. analysis reveals rich variety time patterns, corresponding different periodic, quasiperiodic, chaotic attractors. patterns undergo complex hysteresis loops bifurcation parameters slowly changed-for example, modulating input amplitude. using technique four attractors coexisting phase space found. time patterns corresponding coexisting attractors switched one another triggering system short substrate pulses. Furthermore, conditions exist triggering autonomous-i.e., self-sustained (intermittent) switchings occur. time switchings set externally value input amplitude. conditions periods oscillations order minutes, self-sustained switching-which modulates oscillations-can order hours.
