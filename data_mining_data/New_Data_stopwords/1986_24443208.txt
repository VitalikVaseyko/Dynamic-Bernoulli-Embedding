 Activities key enzymes Calvin cycle C4 metabolism, rate (14)CO2 fixation light dark initial products photosynthetic (14)CO2 fixation determined flag leaf different ear parts wheat viz. pericarp, awn glumes. Compared activities RuBP carboxylase Calvin cycle enzymes viz. NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ribulose-5-phosphate kinase, levels PEP carboxylase enzymes C4 metabolism viz. NADP-malate dehydrogenase, NAD-malate dehydrogenase, NADP-malic enzyme, NAD-malic enzyme, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase genase, NADP-malic enzyme, NAD-malic enzyme, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase glutamate pyruvate transaminase, generally greater ear parts flag leaf. contrast CO2 fixation light, various ear parts incorporated CO2 darkness much higher rates flag leaf. short term assimilation (14)CO2 illuminated ear parts, (14)C malate less 3-phosphoglyceric acid, whereas flag leaves incorporated 3-phosphoglyceric acid. seems likely ear parts capability assimilating CO2 C4 pathway photosynthesis utilise PEP carboxylase recapturing respired CO2.
