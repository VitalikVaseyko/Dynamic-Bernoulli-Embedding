 purpose investigation assess influence calorie restriction (CR) alone, higher-protein/lower-carbohydrate intake alone, combined CR higher-protein/lower-carbohydrate intake glucose homeostasis, hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), intrahepatic triglycerides. Twelve-week old male Sprague Dawley rats consumed ad libitum (AL) CR (40% restriction), adequate (10%), high (32%) protein (PRO) milk-based diets 16 weeks. Metabolic profiles assessed serum, intrahepatic triglyceride concentrations molecular markers de novo lipogenesis determined liver. Independent calorie intake, 32% PRO tended result lower homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values compared 10% PRO, insulin homeostatic model assessment beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) values lower CR AL, regardless protein intake. Intrahepatic triglyceride concentrations 27.4 +/- 4.5 11.7 +/- 4.5 micromol.g(-1) lower (p < 0.05) CR 32% PRO compared AL 10% PRO, respectively. Gene expression fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA destaurase-1 (SCD1) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) 45% +/- 1%, 23% +/- 1%, 57% +/- 1% lower (p < 0.05), respectively, CR AL, regardless protein intake. Total protein FASN SCD 50% +/- 1% 26% +/- 1% lower (p < 0.05) 32% PRO compared 10% PRO, independent calorie intake. Results investigation provide evidence metabolic health benefits associated CR-specifically reduction intrahepatic triglyceride content-may enhanced consuming higher-protein/lower-carbohydrate diet.
