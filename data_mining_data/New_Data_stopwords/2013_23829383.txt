 BACKGROUND: Recent studies animal models, based hypothesis malignant glioma cells dependent glycolysis energy generation, shown promising results using ketogenic diet (KD) therapy alternative treatment strategy malignant glioma, effectively starving glioma cells providing ketone bodies energy source normal neurons glial cells. order test treatment strategy humans, investigated relative expression several key enzymes involved ketolytic glycolytic metabolism human anaplastic glioma (WHO grade III) glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry performed formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections 22 brain biopsies (17 GBM, 3 anaplastic astrocytoma 2 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) using antibodies raised glycolytic ketolytic enzymes. glycolytic enzymes included hexokinase-II (HK2) pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2). ketone body metabolic enzymes included: succinyl CoA: 3-oxoacid CoA transferase (OXCT1), 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 2 (BDH1 BDH2), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). immunoreactivities graded using semi-quantitative scale based percentage positive cells: POS (>20%), LOW (5-20%), low (VLOW) (<5%). Focal non-neoplastic "normal" brain tissue within biopsy specimens served internal controls. RESULTS: rate limiting mitochondrial ketolytic enzymes (OXCT1 BDH1) either LOW VLOW, concordantly 14 17 GBMs 1 5 anaplastic gliomas, whereas least one glycolytic enzymes POS 13 17 GBMs 5 anaplastic gliomas. Cytosolic BDH2 mitochondrial ACTAT1 were, surprisingly, POS tumors. CONCLUSION: results showing malignant gliomas differential expression ketolytic glycolytic enzymes consistent previous studies shown genetically heterogeneous tumors. seems reasonable hypothesize patients low low expression key ketolytic enzymes malignant gliomas may respond better KD therapy patients positive expression enzymes. studies animal models and/or large-scale clinical trial would needed test hypothesis.
