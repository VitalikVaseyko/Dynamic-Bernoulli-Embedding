 Cidofovir [CDV; (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonomethoxyethyl)cytosine] acyclic nucleotide analog potent selective vitro vivo activities broad spectrum herpesviruses DNA viruses. studied mechanism enzymatic synthesis CDV diphosphate, putative antiviral metabolite CDV. phosphorylation two-step process catalyzed several enzymes. enzymatic activity phosphorylating CDV monophosphate derivative purified human liver identified pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.14.). CDV (Km = 2.10 +/- 0.18 mM Vmax = 1.10 +/- 0.05 micromol/min/mg) found substantially weaker substrate purified enzyme CMP, UMP, dCMP. Pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase used preparative enzymatic synthesis CDV monophosphate. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2), nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) found catalyze CDV diphosphate synthesis CDV monophosphate, whereas phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) succinyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.4) not. Based Vmax/Km (phosphorylation efficiency) values determined enzymes purified human sources, efficient phosphorylation CDV monophosphate catalyzed pyruvate kinase. infection human lung fibroblasts cytomegalovirus, intracellular activities pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase increased 2-, 1.3-, 3-, 5-fold, respectively. metabolism [3H]CDV mock- cytomegalovirus-infected cells examined. intracellular levels CDV monophosphate CDV diphosphate increased approximately 20- 8-fold, respectively, cytomegalovirus-infected cells, presumably due stimulation CDV uptake higher activities phosphorylating enzymes.
