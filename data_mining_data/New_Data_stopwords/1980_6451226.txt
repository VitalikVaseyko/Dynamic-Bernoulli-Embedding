 measured red cells fetal adult Sprague-Dawley Wistar rats activities phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) diphosphoglyceromutase (DPGM) key enzymes regulation 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels gather information possible causes low concentration 2,3-DPG fetal red cells. striking differences seen regard PK DPGM activities. activity PK ten times higher fetal compared adult red cells, whereas red cell DPGM activity absent fetuses high adults. addition, studied postnatal changes red cell PK DPGm activities well 2,3-DPG concentration Sprague-Dawley rats. concentration 2,3-DPG activity DPGM red cells increased almost adult value within 2 4 weeks birth, respectively, activity PK decreased concomitantly. postnatal changes occurred similarly, newborn rats grew conditions hypoxic hypoxia 0.46 atm (pO2 = 9.2 kPa). studies support hypothesis postnatal changes 2,3-DPG levels due changes activity certain glycolytic enzymes switch fetal-type adult-type red cells follows genetically determined time course.
