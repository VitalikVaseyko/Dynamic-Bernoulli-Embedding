 Pyruvate kinase key regulatory enzyme involved glycolytic pathway. crystal structure Escherichia coli type pyruvate kinase first solved 1995 2.5 resolution. However, space group ambiguous, either primitive orthorhombic (P2(1)2(1)2(1)) C-centred orthorhombic (C222(1)). Here, structure determination refinement E. coli type pyruvate kinase 2.28 resolution presented. Using crystallization conditions reported previously, enzyme found crystallize space group P2(1). Determination space group complicated owing anisotropic data, pseudo-translational noncrystallographic symmetry pseudo-merohedrally twinned nature crystal, found close 50% twinning, leading apparent orthorhombic symmetry absences inconsistent P2(1)2(1)2(1). unit cell contained two tetramers asymmetric unit (3720 residues) and, compared orthorhombic structure, virtually residues could easily modelled density. Averaging reflections lower symmetry space group twinning provided tidier electron density allowed approximately 30 missing residues lid domain modelled first time. Moreover, residues flexible loop could modelled sulfate molecules found allosteric binding domain, identifying pocket binds allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate isozyme first time. Lastly, note pedagogical benefits difficult structures emerging crystallographers.
