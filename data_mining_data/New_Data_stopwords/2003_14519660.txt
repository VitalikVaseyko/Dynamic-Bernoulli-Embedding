 Physical exercise produces several adaptive changes skeletal muscle. However, molecular mechanisms effects poorly understood. performed serial analysis gene expression (SAGE) quantify global gene expression profile sedentary endurance-trained muscle. total 10869 SAGE tags sequenced represented 4727 genes. genes expressed muscle mainly involved contraction energy metabolism. Thirty-three genes differentially expressed endurance athletes sedentary individuals. Four genes myosin binding protein C fast-type, glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase expressed less endurance athletes, whereas eight genes coding expressed sequence tag similar (EST) crystallin alpha B, EST myosin light chain 2, EST surfactant pulmonary-associated protein A1, EST thrombospondin, EST fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, EST cytochrome oxidase 1, NADH dehydrogenase 3, G8 protein up-regulated. up-regulated tags corresponded novel genes. hand, different isoforms fructose-bisphosphate aldolase also differentially expressed. current study underlying highly expressed genes allows better understanding global muscle characteristics normal endurance-trained individuals. Moreover, current data suggest novel candidate genes may responsible enhanced endurance performance.
