 Elevated glucose concentrations stimulate L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene transcription liver islet beta-cells. glucose response element termed L4 box (two noncanonical E-boxes located -165 -154 base pairs upstream transcriptional start point) previously defined within proximal promoter region gene. However, identity transacting factor(s) binds site remains unclear. used photon counting digital imaging firefly luciferase activity monitor promoter activity continuously single living islet beta derived INS-1 cells, analyze molecular basis regulation glucose. L-PK promoter activity, normalized cytomegalovirus promoter activity using distinct Renilla reniformis luciferase, >/=6-fold higher cells cultured 16 mM glucose compared cells cultured 3 mM glucose. Microinjection antibodies ubiquitous transcription factor USF2 inhibited L-PK promoter activity beta- INS-1 cells incubated 30 mM glucose 71-87%. Anti-USF2 antibodies much smaller effect promoter activity INS-1 cells cultured 3 mM glucose, activity modified promoter construct lacking L4 box. data support view glucose enhances L-PK gene transcription beta-cells modifying transactivational capacity USF2 bound upstream L4 box.
