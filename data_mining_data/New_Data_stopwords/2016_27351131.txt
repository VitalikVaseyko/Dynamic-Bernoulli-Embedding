 Cancer cells exhibit reprogrammed metabolism mainly via aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon known historically Warburg effect; however, underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. study, characterized critical role transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) aerobic glycolysis human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) molecular mechanisms. data showed aberrant expression FOXM1 significantly contributed reprogramming glucose metabolism EOC cells. Aerobic glycolysis cell proliferation down-regulated EOC cells FOXM1 gene expression suppressed RNA interference. Moreover, knockdown FOXM1 EOC cells significantly reduced glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. FOXM1 bound directly GLUT1 HK2 promoter regions regulated promoter activities expression genes transcriptional level. reveals novel mechanism glucose metabolism regulated FOXM1. Importantly, demonstrated expression levels FOXM1, GLUT1 HK2 significantly increased human EOC tissues relative normal ovarian tissues, FOXM1 expression positively correlated GLUT1 HK2 expression. Taken together, results show FOXM1 promotes reprogramming glucose metabolism EOC cells via activation GLUT1 HK2 transcription, suggesting FOXM1 may important target aerobic glycolysis pathway developing novel anticancer agents.
