 Tumor cells rely elevated glucose consumption metabolism survival proliferation. Glucose transporters mediating glucose entry key proximal rate-limiting checkpoints. Unlike GLUT1 highly expressed cancer ubiquitously expressed normal tissues, GLUT4 exhibits limited normal expression profiles. previously determined insulin-responsive GLUT4 constitutively localized plasma membrane myeloma cells. Consequently, suppression GLUT4 inhibition glucose transport HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir elicited growth arrest and/or apoptosis multiple myeloma. GLUT4 inhibition also caused sensitization metformin multiple myeloma chronic lymphocytic leukemia number solid tumors suggesting broader therapeutic utility targeting GLUT4. study sought identify selective inhibitors GLUT4 develop potent cancer chemotherapeutic fewer potential off-target effects. Recently, crystal structure GLUT1 inward open conformation reported. Although important achievement, full understanding structural biology facilitative glucose transport remains elusive. date, three-dimensional structure GLUT4. generated homology model GLUT4 utilized screen drug-like compounds library 18 million compounds. Despite 68% homology GLUT1 GLUT4, virtual screen identified two potent compounds shown target GLUT4 preferentially GLUT1 block glucose transport. results strongly bolster utility developing GLUT4-selective inhibitors anti-cancer therapeutics.
