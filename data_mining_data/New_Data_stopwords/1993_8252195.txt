 report comparative 31P-NMR studies in-vivo in-vitro human adenocarcinoma cell line HCT-116 high-density, perfused microcarrier culture tumour cell line grown three different immune-suppressed animal models (NIH triple deficient, Nude, SCID). phosphate metabolite ratios, pHNMR intracellular free magnesium, derived 31P-NMR spectra, compared in-vivo in-vitro systems. Results obtained HCT-116 cells microcarrier beads quantitatively similar small (122 mm3), tumours in-vivo derived cell line immune-suppressed animal systems studied. suggests in-vitro microcarrier cell culture serves useful model system deriving information metabolism small, tumours in-vivo. offers additional advantages allowing precise control substrate milieu, perfusion oxygenation. microcarrier system also used measure flux glycolysis pentose cycle. particular, measured glucose utilization production lactate, alanine, glutamine glycogen proton-decoupled 13C-NMR experiments following administration [1-13C]glucose. found (63% +/- 6%) glucose utilized released [3-13C] lactate presence oxygen, indicating HCT-116 cells high level aerobic glycolysis. Serial labelling experiments [1-13C] glucose [6-13C] glucose reveal least (11.6% +/- 1.3%) glucose utilized enters pentose cycle. determined (6.9% +/- 1.2%) glucose utilized recycled glucose via pentose cycle (4.7% +/- 1.4%) glucose utilized enters pentose cycle form lactate. high rate recycling via pentose cycle suggests significant fraction cellular NADPH generated pentose cycle opposed generation malate-pyruvate shuttle.
