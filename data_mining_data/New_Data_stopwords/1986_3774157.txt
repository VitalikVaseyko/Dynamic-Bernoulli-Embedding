 Stimulation bovine chromaffin cell culture changed (increased decreased) phosphorylation state several proteins examined 32P incorporation. Enhanced phosphorylation 22 protein bands well increased dephosphorylation 20.4 kilodaltons protein band observed extracts cultured chromaffin cells stimulated either acetylcholine high K+ subjected mono-dimensional gel electrophoresis. several protein bands, degree phosphorylation larger cells stimulated acetylcholine challenged depolarizing concentration K+. affected phosphoproteins apparent molecular weights 14,800, 29,000, 33,000, 57,000 (tubulin subunit), 63,000 (tyrosine hydroxylase subunit) 94,000. presence low extracellular calcium concentration (0.5 mM Ca2+ plus 15 mM Mg2+) incubation medium inhibited (38-100%) acetylcholine-evoked increases protein phosphorylation observed previously 18 protein bands. Trifluoperazine concentration required 50% inhibition acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release decreases (33-100%) stimulation-induced phosphorylation polypeptides, exception 14.8 kilodaltons dephosphorylated 20.4 kilodaltons components affected. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed exposure chromaffin cells acetylcholine produced two types effect protein phosphorylation: activation protein kinase activities affecting 30 polypeptides; activation protein phosphatase activities resulting dephosphorylation 40 polypeptides, appearing minor phosphoproteins, exception alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase 20.4 kilodaltons polypeptide. basis molecular properties (molecular weight pI) abundance chromaffin cells, 80 kilodaltons phosphoprotein focused pI 4.8 117.5 kilodaltons phosphoprotein focused pI 5.0 identified chromogranins B, respectively. relationship acetylcholine-induced protein phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) catecholamine secretion also investigated. time course protein phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) paralleled preceded [3H]noradrenaline release 16 phosphoproteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
