 Intracellular pH (pHi) plays important role maintenance normal cell function, maintained within narrow range activity transporters located plasma membrane. Modulation tumor pHi may influence proliferation, apoptosis, chemotherapy resistance, thermosensitivity. Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) novel MRI contrast mechanism dependent cellular pH. Amine amide concentration-independent detection (AACID) recently developed CEST contrast method intracellular pH (pHi) weighted. Dichloroacetate (DCA) alter tumor pHi inhibiting enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase causing reduced lactate (increasing pHi), decreasing expression monocarboxylate transporters vacuolar ATPase leading reduced pHi. Since net vivo effect DCA pHi difficult predict, purpose study quantify magnitude acute pHi change glioblastoma single DCA injection using AACID CEST MRI. Using 9.4T MRI scanner, CEST spectra acquired six mice approximately 14 days implanting 10(5) U87 human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells brain, intravenous injection DCA (dose: 200 mg/kg). Three additional mice received phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection studied controls. Repeated measures test used compare AACID changes tumor contralateral tissue regions interest. One hour DCA injection significant increase tumor AACID level 0.04 +/- 0.01 corresponding 0.16 decrease pHi, change AACID contralateral tissue. Inspection AACID maps following PBS injection showed differences. use DCA induce tumor specific pH change detectable AACID CEST MRI consistent previous studies shown similar effects lonidamine topiramate. study demonstrates single dose DCA used pharmacological challenge induced rapid tumor intracellular acidification.
