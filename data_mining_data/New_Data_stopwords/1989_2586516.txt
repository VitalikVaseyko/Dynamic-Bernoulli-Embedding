 DNA fragment spanning nucleotides -183 -4 respect cap site rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene contains least four binding sites putative transcriptional factors: hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), liver factor A1 (LF-A1), nuclear factor 1 (NF1), major late transcription factor (MLTF). fragment used direct transcription reporter sequence (a G-free cassette) cell extracts. L-PK promoter active liver nuclear extracts, extracts nonhepatic tissues. reduction 50% activity obtained deleted L-PK promoter containing HNF1-binding site. contrast, deletion HNF1-binding site inactivated promoter 90%. results confirmed titration experiments synthetic oligonucleotides. Titration HNF1 resulted 85% decrease transcriptional activity, titration LF-A1 resulted 40% decrease. influence NF1 MLTF seemed marginal system. proximal 5'-flanking sequence L-PK gene therefore appears function vitro efficient liver-specific promoter requires binding liver factor HNF1 also stimulated binding another liver-specific factor, LF-A1.
