 effects cell age metabolism nucleated red blood cells rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) examined. Red blood cells separated according age using fixed-angle centrifugation. mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration old red blood cells found 120 % young red blood cells. young red blood cells, activities mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase cytochrome oxidase 135-200 %, respectively, measured old red blood cells. activity glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase young red blood cells 170 % old red blood cells, whereas activity glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase significantly affected cell age. addition, young red blood cells consumed twice much O(2) devoted 50 % O(2) protein synthesis activity Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase old red blood cells. Red blood cell age significantly affect rate lactate production. study shows ageing rainbow trout nucleated red blood cells accompanied significant decline aerobic energy production processes supports, well corresponding increase glycolytic contribution metabolism.
