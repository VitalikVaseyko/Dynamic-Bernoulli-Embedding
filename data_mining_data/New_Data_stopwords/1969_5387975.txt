 1. Erythrocytes normal glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient humans subjected hydrogen peroxide diffusion oxidize GSH. Studies carried presence absence chromate inhibit glutathione reductase without addition glucose. 2. GSH content erythrocytes species oxidized subjecting hydrogen peroxide diffusion presence chromate glucose. 3. Chromate (1.3mm) inhibited glutathione reductase 80%, whereas glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase inhibited. 4. GSSG formed transported erythrocytes medium. 5. transport rate GSSG glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes subjected hydrogen peroxide diffusion presence chromate comparable normal glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes. 6. rate transport GSSG erythrocytes various species studied could ranked: pigeon>rabbit>rat>donkey>man>dog>horse>sheep>chicken>fish.
