 Virtually everyone working cancer research familiar "Warburg effect", i.e., anaerobic glycolysis presence oxygen tumor cells. However, people nowadays aware lead Otto Warburg discovery observation scientific contributions seminal present knowledge metabolic energetic processes cells. Since science human endeavor, scientist imbedded network social academic contacts, worth taking glimpse biography Otto Warburg illustrate influences historical landmarks life. creative innovative thinking experimental virtuosity set framework scientific achievements, pioneering cancer research. Here, shall allude prestigious family background imperial Germany; relationships Einstein, Meyerhof, Krebs, Nobel notable scientists; innovative technical developments applications advancement biomedical sciences, including manometer, tissue slicing, cell cultivation. latter experimental prerequisites first metabolic measurements tumor cells 1920s. 1930s-1940s, improved spectrophotometry chemical analysis developed optical tests measuring activities glycolytic enzymes. Warburg's reputation brought invitations USA contacts Rockefeller Foundation; received Nobel Prize 1931. World politics world wars heavily affected Warburg's scientific survival Berlin. But, second postwar recovery, Warburg's drive unraveling energetic processes life, plants tumor cells, continued death 1970. legacy Otto Warburg Warburg effect, also identification "respiratory ferment" hydrogen-transferring cofactors isolation glycolytic enzymes. hypothesis respiratory damage cause cancer remains provocative scientific issue, along implications cancer treatment prevention. Warburg therefore still stimulating thinking, documented soaring increase publications citing name context tumor metabolism.
