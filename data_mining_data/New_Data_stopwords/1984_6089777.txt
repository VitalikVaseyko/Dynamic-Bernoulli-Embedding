 Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels assayed freeze-clamped livers anesthesized rats. doses pentobarbital effective anesthesizing rats caused significant decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Injection pentobarbital also resulted decreased 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase activity increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity measured dialyzed (NH4)2SO4-treated liver extracts change pyruvate kinase activity. concluded anesthesia-induced decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels results least part increased phosphorylation 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase.
