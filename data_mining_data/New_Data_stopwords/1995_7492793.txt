 Mutant mice splenomegaly nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia found inbred colony CBA/N (hereafter CBA) strain maintained Japan SLC Haruno farm (Shuchi-gun, Shizuoka, Japan). activity pyruvate kinase (PK) red blood cells (RBCs) anemic mutants decreased 16.2% normal (+/+) CBA mice. mutant CBA mice showed remarkable reticulocytosis (41.6%) PK activity reticulocytes much higher mature RBCs, PK activity mature RBCs mutant CBA mice calculated 2.8% mature RBCs CBA-(+/+) mice. RBC type PK encoded Pk-1 locus mouse (chromosome 3), designated mutant locus Pk-1slc. anemia PK deficiency CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice cured bone marrow transplantation (BMT) CBA-(+/+) mice. Prior irradiation necessary curative BMT. hand, BMT CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice nonirradiated CBA-(+/+) mice result decrease RBCs reduction PK activity. present results indicate CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice potentially useful animal model studying pathophysiology PK deficiency developing new therapeutic methods correct PK deficiency.
