 Resistance anticancer drugs major obstacle preventing effective treatment disseminated cancers. Understanding molecular basis chemoresistance likely provide better treatment. Cell lines resistant cisplatin 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) established human gastric carcinoma cell lines SNU-638 SNU-620. Comparative proteomics involving 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) performed protein extracts parental drug-resistant derivative lines screen drug resistance-related proteins. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PK-M2) identified protein showing lower expression cisplatin-resistant cells compared parental cells. Consistent finding, PK-M2 activity also lower cisplatin-resistant cells. Suppression PK-M2 expression antisense oligonucleotide resulted acquired cisplatin resistance SNU-638 cells. Furthermore, PK-M2 activity 11 individual human gastric carcinoma cell lines positively correlated cisplatin sensitivity. Taken together, PK-M2 protein activity levels lower cisplatin-resistant human gastric carcinoma cell lines compared parental cell lines. Furthermore, suppression PK-M2 expression using antisense oligonucleotides increased cisplatin resistance. data clearly link PK-M2 cisplatin resistance mechanisms.
