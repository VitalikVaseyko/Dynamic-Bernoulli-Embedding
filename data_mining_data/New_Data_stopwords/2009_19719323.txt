 energetic landscape allosteric regulatory mechanism rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) characterized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Four novel insights uncovered. (1) ADP exhibits dual property. Depending temperature, ADP regulate RMPK activity switching enzyme either R state. (2) assumption ligand binding RMPK state-dependent correct PEP Phe ADP. (3) effect pH regulatory behavior RMPK partly due complex pattern proton release absorption linked multiple linked equilibria govern activity enzyme. (4) R <--> equilibrium accompanied significant DeltaC(p), rendering RMPK sensitive temperature physiological conditions. rigorously test validity conclusions derived ITC data, study fluorescence approach, albeit indirect, tracks continuous structural perturbations employed. Intrinsic Trp fluorescence RMPK absence presence substrates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP, allosteric inhibitor Phe, measured temperature range 4 45 degrees C. data analysis, fluorescence data complemented ITC experiments yield extended data set allowing complete characterization RMPK regulatory mechanism. Twenty-one thermodynamic parameters derived define network linked interactions involved regulating allosteric behavior RMPK global analysis ITC fluorescent data sets. study, 27 independent curves 1600 experimental points globally analyzed. Consequently, consensus results substantiate conclusions derived ITC data also structural information characterizing transition active inactive states RMPK antagonism ADP Phe binding. latter observation reveals novel role ADP allosteric regulation RMPK.
