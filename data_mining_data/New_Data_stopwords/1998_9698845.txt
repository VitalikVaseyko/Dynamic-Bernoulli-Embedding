 Genetic diversity among three field populations Lutzomyia longipalpis Colombia studied using isozyme analysis. Study sites much 598 km apart included populations separated eastern Cordillera Andes. Genetic variability among populations, estimated heterozygosity, within values typical insects general (8.1%). Heterozygosity field populations compared laboratory colony Colombia (Melgar colony) slightly lower. results suggest establishment long term maintenance Melgar colony little effect level isozyme variability carries. Genetic divergences populations evaluated using estimates genetic distance. Genetic divergence among three field populations low (D = 0.021), suggesting represent local populations within single species. Genetic distance field populations Melgar colony also low (D = 0.016), suggesting colony population depart significantly natural populations. Finally, comparisons made Colombian populations colonies Brazil Costa Rica. Genetic distance values high Colombian Brazil Costa Rica colony populations (D = 0.199 0.098 respectively) providing additional support earlier report populations three countries represent distinct species.
