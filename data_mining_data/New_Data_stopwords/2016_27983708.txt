 review summarizes current state knowledge metabolism cancer cells, especially respect "Warburg" "Crabtree" effects. work also summarizes two key discoveries, one relates hexokinase-2 (HK2), major player "Warburg effect" cancer cell immortalization. second discovery relates finding cancer cells, unlike normal cells, derive much 60% ATP glycolysis via "Warburg effect", remaining 40% derived mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Also described selected anticancer agents generally act strong energy blockers inside cancer cells. Among them, much attention focused 3-bromopyruvate (3BP). small alkylating compound targets "Warburg effect", i.e., elevated glycolysis even presence oxygen, well mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation cancer cells. Normal cells remain unharmed. 3BP rapidly kills cancer cells growing tissue culture, eradicates tumors animals, prevents metastasis. addition, properly formulated 3BP shows promise also effective anti-liver cancer agent humans effective also toward cancers known "multiple myeloma". Finally, 3BP shown significantly extend life human patient options available. Thus, stated 3BP promising new anti-cancer agent process undergoing clinical development.
