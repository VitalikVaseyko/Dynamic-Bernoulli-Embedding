 Long-chain acyl coenzyme (acyl-CoA) synthetase isoform 1 (ACSL1) catalyzes synthesis acyl-CoA long-chain fatty acids contributes majority cardiac long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity. understand functional role heart, studied mice lacking ACSL1 globally (Acsl1(T-/-)) mice lacking ACSL1 heart ventricles (Acsl1(H-/-)) different times. Compared littermate controls, heart ventricular ACSL activity Acsl1(T-/-) mice reduced 90%, acyl-CoA content 65% lower, long-chain acyl-carnitine content 80 90% lower. rate [(14)C]palmitate oxidation heart homogenate mitochondria 90% lower controls, maximal rates [(14)C]pyruvate [(14)C]glucose oxidation 20% higher. mitochondrial area 54% greater controls twice much mitochondrial DNA, mRNA abundance Pgc1alpha Erralpha increased 100% 41%, respectively. Compared controls, Acsl1(T-/-) Acsl1(H-/-) hearts hypertrophied, phosphorylation S6 kinase, target mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, increased 5-fold. data suggest ACSL1 required synthesize acyl-CoAs oxidized heart, without ACSL1, diminished fatty acid (FA) oxidation compensatory catabolism glucose amino acids lead mTOR activation cardiac hypertrophy without lipid accumulation immediate cardiac dysfunction.
