 Platinum agents cause DNA damage thus induce apoptosis cancer cells, made backbone cancer chemotherapy regimens. However, cancers develop drug resistance course treatment. Meanwhile, tumors meet energy needs largely aerobic glycolysis (glycolysis presence oxygen, called Warburg effect), related resistance apoptosis. Therefore, used biodegradable polymer carrier conjugate DACH-Pt dichloroacetate, PDK inhibitor reverse Warburg effect derepress resistance apoptosis, thus sensitizing cancer cells platinum. as-prepared polymer-drug conjugates assembled nanoparticles effective delivery better synergism. vitro vivo studies revealed combination polymer-DCA polymer-DACH-Pt much better free drugs administered simultaneously, terms safety antitumor efficacy.
