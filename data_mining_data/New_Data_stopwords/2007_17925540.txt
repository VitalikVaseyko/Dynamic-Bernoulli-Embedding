 Tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) discovered cell membrane protein predominantly expressed tumor endothelium identified receptor anthrax toxin. developed antibody-like molecule consists protective antigen (PA)-binding domain human TEM8 linked Fc portion human immunoglobulin G1 (TEM8-Fc). engineered protein bound PA divalent cation-dependent manner efficiently protected J774A.1 macrophage-like cells anthrax toxin challenge dose-dependent manner. TEM8-Fc suppressed growth metastasis xenograft human tumors athymic nude mice (control versus 10 mg/kg TEM8-Fc, mean tumor weight: LS-180, 1.72 versus 0.16 g, difference = 1.56 g, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 2.16 g; P<.001; MCF-7, 1.12 versus 0.08 g, difference = 1.04 g, 95% CI = 0.77 1.31 g; P<.001; HepG2, 1.28 versus 0.35 g, difference = 0.93 g, 95% CI = 0.60 1.25 g; P<.001). Furthermore, TEM8 interacted M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), important role tumor growth metastasis. TEM8-Fc novel therapeutic antibody-like agent management solid tumors may act trapping M2-PK.
