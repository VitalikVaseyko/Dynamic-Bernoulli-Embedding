 Cancer cells present particular metabolic behavior. hypothesized progression bladder cancer could accompanied changes cells glycolytic profile. studied two human bladder cancer cells, RT4 TCCSUP, latter represents invasive stage. levels glucose, pyruvate, alanine lactate extracellular media measured Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. protein expression levels glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) 3 (GLUT3), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) determined. data showed glucose consumption GLUT3 levels similar cell lines, TCCSUP cells displayed lower levels GLUT1 PFK expression. increase pyruvate consumption, concordant higher levels lactate alanine production, also detected TCCSUP cells. Moreover, TCCSUP cells presented lower protein expression levels GPT LDH. results illustrate bladder cancer progression associated alterations cells glycolytic profile, namely switch glucose pyruvate consumption aggressive stage. may useful develop new therapies identify biomarkers cancer progression.
