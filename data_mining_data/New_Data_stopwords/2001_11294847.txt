 Pyruvate kinase (PK) cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301 purified 1,300-fold electrophoretic homogeneity final specific activity 222 micromol pyruvate produced/min/mg protein. enzyme shown pI 5.7 exist 280-kDa homotetramer composed 66-kDa subunits. PK appears immunologically related Bacillus PK green algal chloroplast PK, rabbit muscle PK, vascular plant cytosolic plastidic PKs. N-terminal amino acid sequence Synechococcus PK exhibited maximal (67%) identity corresponding region putative PK-A sequence deduced genome cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC 6803. Synechococcus PK relatively heat-labile displayed broad pH optimum around pH 7.0. activity influenced K(+), required high concentrations Mg(2+), relatively nonspecific respect nucleoside diphosphate substrate. Potent allosteric regulation various effectors observed (activators: hexose monophosphates, ribose 5-phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, AMP; inhibitors: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, inorganic phosphate, ATP, several Krebs' cycle intermediates). enzyme exhibited marked positive cooperativity phosphoenolpyruvate, eliminated reduced presence allosteric activators. results discussed terms phylogeny probable central role PK control cyanobacterial glycolysis.
