 Cooperative interactions nucleotide binding sites beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase studied measuring substrate-promoted release 5'adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) single high affinity site. site initially loaded incubating F1 equimolar amount nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. unbound [3H]AMP-PNP removed complex diluted concentration Kd, release ligand shows apparent absolute requirement medium ADP. Release biphasic extent release initial rapid phase dependent concentration medium ADP. Although phosphate alone effect, enhances rapid phase ADP-promoted release 2-fold half-maximal effect 60 micrometers P1. binding efrapeptin (A23871) F1.AMP-PNP complex completely prevents ADP-promoted dissociation. Although AMP-PNP release also occurs presence medium ATP, F1.AMP-PNP complex dissociate ATP-regenerating system sufficient capacity prevent accumulation medium ADP added. Consistent inability nucleoside triphosphate promote release failure medium, nonradioactive AMP-PNP affect retention 3H-labeled ligand. stability F1.AMP-PNP complex absence medium nucleotide highly specific ability ADP plus P1 promote rapid release ATP analog interpreted support ATP synthesis mechanism requires substrate binding one catalytic site product release adjacent interacting site.
