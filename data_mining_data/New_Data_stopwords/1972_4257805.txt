 Previous studies shown marked effect high levels copper red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione. effect nearly physiological levels copper studied, red cell hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglyceric kinase, pyruvate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase found inhibited. Inhibition observed copper added directly hemolysates hemolysates prepared red cells whole blood incubated copper washed. inhibition red cell enzymes copper completely reversed addition EDTA.
