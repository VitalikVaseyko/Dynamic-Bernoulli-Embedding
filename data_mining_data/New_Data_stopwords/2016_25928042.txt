 BACKGROUND: Reports morphologic functional characteristics spermatozoa prepared density gradient centrifugation (DC) swim-up (SU) produced discordant results. performed proteomic comparison cells prepared DC SU providing molecular insight differences two methods sperm cell isolation. METHODS: Protein maps obtained 2-dimensional (2-D) separations consisting isoelectrofocusing (IEF) pI 3 11 followed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2-D gels stained Sypro Ruby. Map images DC SU spermatozoa compared using dedicated software. Intensities given spot considered different DC SU group mean differed >1.5-fold (p<0.05, Anova). RESULTS: differences observed 853 spots, indicating 98.7% similarity DC SU. Five spots DC>SU 1 SU>DC. Proteins present 3 differential spots could identified. One DC>SU spot contained lactate dehydrogenase C gamma-glutamylhydrolase, second DC>SU spot contained fumarate hydratase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-2, SU>DC spot contained pyruvate kinase M1/M2. CONCLUSIONS: differences protein levels found comparison DC SU spermatozoa indicate possible dissimilarities glycolytic metabolism DNA methylation suggest DC cells may better capacitation potential.
