 Conversion pyruvate acetate via phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway generates ATP major overflow pathway conditions carbon nitrogen excess. Bacillus subtilis, pathway positively regulated CcpA, global regulator carbon metabolism genes. Transcription acetate kinase gene (ackA) proved activated well second global regulatory protein, CodY. Expression ackA-lacZ fusion reduced codY mutant strain. CodY found bind vitro two sites ackA promoter region stimulate ackA transcription run-off transcription assay. first known case direct positive regulation CodY. CodY CcpA found bind neighbouring sites effects additive vivo vitro. Surprisingly, positive regulation CodY, unlike repression, responded primarily one type effector molecule. is, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) served potent co-activators CodY-dependent ackA transcription GTP. Given roles CcpA CodY regulating genes whose products determine metabolic fate pyruvate, two proteins may act together mediate hierarchical conversion pyruvate many potential products.
