 effect cold exposure (-10 degrees C, air speed--2.5 m/sec, 40 minutes) physical activity, cognitive processes metabolic status 75 volunteers, healthy men 20-24, studied termobarocomplex Tabaj (Japan). Cold exposure reduced physical cognitive activity, activity kreatine phosphokinase, superoxide dismutase, levels redox glutation pyruvate. Preliminary administration adaptogenic drug trekrezan 0.2 g prior cold exposure normalized indexes studied physical activity metabolic status. suggested trekrezan used meteoadaptogenic drug rapid effective adaptation cold exposure environment.
