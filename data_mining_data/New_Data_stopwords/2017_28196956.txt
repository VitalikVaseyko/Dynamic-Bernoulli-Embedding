 Staphylococcus aureus must rapidly adapt variety carbon nitrogen sources invasion host. Within staphylococcal abscess, preferred carbon sources glucose limiting, suggesting S. aureus survives catabolism secondary carbon sources. S. aureus encodes pathways catabolize multiple amino acids, including generate pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate. assess amino acid catabolism, S. aureus JE2 mutants grown complete defined medium containing 18 amino acids lacking glucose (CDM). mutation gudB gene, coding glutamate dehydrogenase, generates 2-oxoglutarate glutamate, significantly reduced growth CDM, suggesting glutamate amino acids generating glutamate, particularly proline, serve major carbon source medium. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies confirmed supposition. Furthermore, mutation ackA gene, coding acetate kinase, also abrogated growth JE2 CDM, suggesting ATP production pyruvate-producing amino acids also critical growth. addition, although functional respiratory chain absolutely required growth, oxygen consumption rate intracellular ATP concentration significantly lower growth CDM growth glucose-containing media. Finally, transcriptional analyses demonstrated expression levels genes coding enzymes synthesize glutamate proline, arginine, histidine repressed CcpA carbon catabolite repression. data show pathways important glutamate catabolism ATP generation via Pta/AckA important growth niches glucose abundant, abscesses within skin soft tissue infections.IMPORTANCES. aureus significant cause morbidity mortality worldwide. bacterium causes infections wide variety organ systems, common skin soft tissue. Within staphylococcal abscess, levels glucose, preferred carbon source, limited due host immune response. Therefore, S. aureus must utilize available carbon sources amino acids peptides proliferate. results show glutamate amino acids serve substrates glutamate synthesis, particularly proline, function major carbon sources growth, whereas amino acids generate pyruvate important ATP synthesis via substrate-level phosphorylation Pta-AckA pathway. data support model whereby certain amino acid catabolic pathways, acquisition particular amino acids, crucial growth niches glucose abundant.
