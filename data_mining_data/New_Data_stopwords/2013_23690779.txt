 Cancer cells generally rely mostly glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) ATP production. fact, particularly sensitive glycolysis inhibition glucose depletion. hand mitochondrial dysfunctions, involved onset Warburg effect, sometimes also associated resistance apoptosis characterizes cancer cells. Therefore, combined treatments targeting glycolysis mitochondria function, exploiting peculiar tumor features, might lethal cancer cells. study, show glucose deprivation mitochondrial Complex inhibitors synergize inducing cancer cell death. particular, results reveal low doses Complex inhibitors, ineffective immortalized cells high glucose growth, become specifically cytotoxic cancer cells deprived glucose. Importantly, cytotoxic effect inhibitors cancer cells strongly enhanced forskolin, PKA pathway activator, previously shown stimulate OXPHOS. Taken together, demonstrate induction cancer cells switch glycolytic respirative metabolism, obtained glucose depletion mitochondrial activity stimulation, strongly increases sensitivity low doses mitochondrial Complex inhibitors. findings might valuable approach eradicate cancer cells.
