 Enzymatic activities involved glucose fermentation Actinomyces naeslundii studied glucose-grown cells batch cultures. Glucose could phosphorylated glucose 6-phosphate glucokinase utilized polyphosphate GTP instead ATP phosphoryl donor. Glucose 6-phosphate metabolized end products lactate, formate, acetate, succinate Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. phosphoryl donor phosphofructokinase PPi. Phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, acetate kinase coupled GDP well ADP, P(i) compounds phosphoryl acceptor. Cell extracts showed GDP-dependent activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, assimilates bicarbonate phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate, precursor succinate. Considerable amounts GTP, polyphosphate, PPi found glucose-fermenting cells, indicating compounds may serve phosphoryl donors acceptors Actinomyces cells. PPi could generated UTP glucose 1-phosphate catalysis UDP-glucose synthase, provides UDP-glucose, precursor glycogen.
