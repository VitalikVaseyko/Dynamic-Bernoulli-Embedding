 Glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (M2-PK) plays key role tumor metabolism energy production. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) critical regulating angiogenesis essential process required tumor growth metastasis. two genes may function accordance tumor development. purpose study investigate relationship expression M2-PK VEGF, association clinicopathological features patients advanced gastric cancer. Expression M2-PK VEGF examined 142 cases paraffin-embedded tissue blocks patients advanced gastric cancer. M2-PK expression found strongly correlate VEGF (r = 0.718). addition, expression M2-PK VEGF correlates tumor size (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0017, respectively), depth invasion (p = 0.0024, p = 0.0261, respectively), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.036, p = 0.028, respectively). high expression levels M2-PK VEGF may indicate poor prognosis patients advanced gastric cancer.
