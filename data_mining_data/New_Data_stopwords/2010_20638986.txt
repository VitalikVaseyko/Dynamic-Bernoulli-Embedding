 Long chain fatty acids pharmacologic ligands peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activate expression genes involved fatty acid glucose oxidation including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT-1A) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). CPT-1A catalyzes transfer long chain fatty acids acyl-CoA carnitine translocation across mitochondrial membranes initiating step mitochondrial oxidation long chain fatty acids. PDK4 phosphorylates inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA glucose oxidation pathway. activity CPT-1A modulated transcriptional changes well malonyl-CoA inhibition. liver, CPT-1A PDK4 gene expression induced starvation, high fat diets PPARalpha ligands. Here, characterized binding site PPARalpha second intron rat CPT-1A gene. studies indicated WY14643 long chain fatty acids induce CPT-1A gene expression element. addition, found mutation PPARalpha binding site reduced expression CPT-1A-luciferase vectors liver fasted rats. demonstrated previously CPT-1A stimulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1) via sequences first intron rat CPT-1A gene. Surprisingly, PGC-1alpha enhance CPT-1A transcription PPARalpha binding site second intron. Following knockdown PGC-1alpha short hairpin RNA, CPT-1A PDK4 genes remained responsive WY14643. Overall, studies indicated PPARalpha PGC-1alpha stimulate transcription CPT-1A gene different regions CPT-1A gene.
