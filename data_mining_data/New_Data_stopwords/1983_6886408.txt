 Monoclonal antibodies serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV) prepared hybridoma technique. provided antibody reagent used develop solid phase antibody-capture assays anti-SPLV IgM IgG SPLV antigen. assays sensitive based human convalescent antibody reagent, economical use SPLV antigen. use enabled serological responses SPLV studied fully sensitivity revealed extent SPLV infection. SPLV antigen detected four patients counter-immuno electrophoresis (CIE) radioimmunoassay (RIA) two others RIA alone. Parvovirus particles seen six electron microscopy. anti-SPLV IgM response measured patients infected SPLV. strong 5-18 days onset illness, declined detectable trace amounts 6 months. Anti-SPLV IgG also formed early, persisted least 6 months. survey 310 blood donors anti-SPLV detected 134 (43%) CIE, 190 (61%) IgG antibody capture RIA.
