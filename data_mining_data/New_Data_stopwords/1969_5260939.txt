 phenylketonuria high levels L-phenylalanine present along increased levels phenylpyruvic acid. present work shows L-phenylalanine competitive inhibitor human brain pyruvate kinase phenylpyruvic acid inhibitor human brain hexokinase. enzymes approximately K(i) inhibitors adult fetal human brain. However, fetal human brain absolute activities enzymes less 10 per cent found adult. Thus, fetal brain enzymes may vulnerable inhibition compounds phenylketonurics. inhibition human brain pyruvate kinase hexokinase L-phenylalanine phenylpyruvic acid may role brain damage phenylketonurics.
