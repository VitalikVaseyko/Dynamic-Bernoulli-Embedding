 ascertain regulation glycolysis perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, 7-day postnatal rats subjected unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed hypoxia 8% oxygen 90 min. Brain concentrations glucose, lactate, key glycolytic intermediates determined specific intervals hypoxia. hypoxia-ischemia, anaerobic glycolysis increased approximately 62% maximal capacity, equates 135% stimulation glycolytic flux. key regulatory enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, stimulated hypoxia-ischemia, enzymatic rate limitations. major rate-limiting step glycolysis transport glucose across blood-brain barrier brain.
