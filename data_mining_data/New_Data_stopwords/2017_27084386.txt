 Systemic hypertension initially promotes compensatory cardiac hypertrophy, yet progresses heart failure (HF), energetic deficits appear central failure. However, transfer energy mitochondria myofibrils often considered part energetic equation. compared hearts old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) normotensive Wistar controls. SHR hearts showed 35% depression mitochondrial function, yet produced least double amount reactive oxygen species (ROS) respiration states left ventricular (LV) homogenates. test connectivity mitochondria myofibrils, respiration tested situ LV permeabilized fibers addition multiple substrates ATP, requires hydrolysis mediate oxidative phosphorylation. trapping ADP using pyruvate kinase enzyme system, tested ADP channeling towards mitochondria, suppressed respiration elevated ROS production SHR fibers. ADP-trapped state also less relieved creatine addition, likely reflecting 30% depression total CK activity SHR heart fibers. Confocal imaging identified 34% longer distance centers myofibril mitochondria SHR hearts, increases transverse metabolite diffusion distances (e.g., ATP, ADP, creatine phosphate). propose impaired connectivity mitochondria myofibrils may contribute elevated ROS production. Impaired energy exchange could result ultrastructural changes occur hypertrophy model hypertension.
