 activities 13 liver 6 brain enzymes studied 7-12 week old CD2F1 male mice fed ad libitum standardized either 12 hours light (0600-1800) alternating 12 hours darkness (1800-0600) (LD12:12); reversed light-dark cycle (darkness 0600-1800; light 1800-0600) (DL12:12). Three separate studies performed two different days; experiment, subgroups 14 animals sacrificed 3-hour intervals. Livers assayed for: isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, glyoxylate reductase, L-alanine aminotransferase, glutamate oxalacetate transaminase, pyruvate decarboxylase, fructose-1-phosphate aldolase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, fatty acid synthetase. Brains assayed phosphoglucose isomerase, adenosine triphosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, malate dehydrogenase. 19 enzymes demonstrated prominent circadian rhythm least one experiment. Moreover, rhythmic variable showed statistically significant fit 24-hour cosine (sine) curve method least squares. general, peak activities liver enzymes analyzed associated beginning dark cycle initiation animal's activity, group brain enzymes peak activities occurred beginning animals' rest span near beginning light cycle. phasing rhythms could reversed within two-week span reversing environmental light-dark cycle 180 degrees.
