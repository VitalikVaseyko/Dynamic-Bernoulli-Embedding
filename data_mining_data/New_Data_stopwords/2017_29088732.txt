 Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome commonly caused A3243G mutation mitochondrial DNA. capacity utilize fatty acid glucose fuel source dynamic switches metabolic fuel preferences transcriptional modulation adaptive mechanism response energy deficiency MELAS syndrome fully elucidated. fibroblasts patients MELAS syndrome demonstrated remarkable deficiency electron transport chain complexes IV, impaired cellular biogenesis glucose deprivation, decreased ATP synthesis. situ analysis bioenergetic properties MELAS cells demonstrated attenuated fatty acid oxidation concomitantly occurred impaired mitochondrial respiration, energy production mostly dependent glycolysis. Furthermore, transcriptional modulation mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, activated downstream modulators leading subsequent increase glycolytic flux activation pyruvate dehydrogenase. contrast, activities carnitine palmitoyltransferase fatty acid oxidation acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 fatty acid synthesis reduced transcriptional regulation factors biogenesis altered. results provide novel information MELAS cells lack adaptive mechanism switch fuel source glucose fatty acid, glycolysis rates increase response energy deficiency. aberrant secondary cellular responses disrupted metabolic homeostasis mediated AMPK signaling pathway may contribute development clinical phenotype.
