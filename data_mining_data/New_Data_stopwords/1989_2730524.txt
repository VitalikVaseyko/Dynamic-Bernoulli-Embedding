 Regional glucose uptake perfused hearts, activities several glycolytic enzymes contributing glucose metabolism perfused nonperfused hearts studied male female rats 8-9 weeks swimming training. left ventricular glucose uptake showed transmural gradient sedentary animals, subendocardial uptake 30% 12% higher subepicardial layer males females, respectively. Swimming exercise abolished left ventricular glucose uptake gradient male rats, female rats opposite gradient found, subepicardial uptake 23% higher subendocardial uptake. activities phosphofructokinase 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase also showed transmural gradients left ventricles. Training abolish gradients. Training-induced changes activities phosphofructokinase, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase found certain sites myocardium. Perfusion isolated hearts 50 min insulin-containing Krebs-Ringer buffer especially affected activities phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, increasing activities left ventricles decreasing atria. results indicate regional differences male female rats cardiac glucose uptake rate swimming training.
