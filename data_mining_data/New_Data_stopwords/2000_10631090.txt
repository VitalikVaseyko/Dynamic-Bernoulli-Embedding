 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) specifically phosphorylates E1alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Sequence analysis cloned PDKs led proposal mechanistically related prokaryotic 2-component His-kinases. reaction mechanism protein His-kinases involves autophosphorylation specific residue followed phosphotransfer Asp residue. Treatment recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana PDK His-directed reagents diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) dichloro-(2,2':6', 2"-terpyridine)-platinum(II) dihydrate led marked inhibition autophosphorylation. addition, DEPC treatment abolished ability PDK trans-phosphorylate inactivate PDC. results validate prediction PDKs require residues activity.
