 Changes thyroid status associated profound alterations biochemical physiological functioning cardiac muscle, although impact cardiac energy metabolism still debated. Similarities changes cardiac gene expression pathological hypertrophy leading heart failure hypothyroidism prompted scientists suggest role thyroid hormone status development metabolic functional alterations disease. thus investigated effects hypothyroidism cardiac energy metabolism. Hypothyroid state (HYPO) induced thyroidectomy propyl-thio-uracyl male rats 3 weeks. examined effects hypothyroid state oxidative capacity mitochondrial substrate utilization measuring oxygen consumption saponin permeabilized cardiac fibers, mitochondrial biogenesis reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction energy metabolism, energy transfer enzymes spectrophotometry. results show maximal oxidative capacity myocardium decreased 24.9 +/- 0.9 control (CT) 19.3 +/- 0.7 micromol O(2) min(-1) g dry weight(-1) HYPO. However, protein content messenger RNA (mRNA) PGC-1alpha mRNA transcription cascade thought control mitochondrial content normal myocardium heart failure, unchanged HYPO. Mitochondrial utilization glycerol-3P (-70%), malate (-45%), octanoate (-24%) pyruvate decreased HYPO. Moreover, creatine kinase system energy transfer hardly affected HYPO. Besides, hypothyroidism decreased activation signaling pathways like p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, AMP-activated protein kinase, calcineurin. results show cellular hypothyroidism hardly account specific energetic alterations heart failure.
