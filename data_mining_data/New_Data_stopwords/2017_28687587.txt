 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) rate-limiting enzyme glucose oxidation critical regulator metabolic flexibility fasting feeding transition. PDH regulated via PDH kinases (PDHK) PDH phosphatases, phosphorylate/inactivate dephosphorylate/activate PDH, respectively. goal determine whether transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) regulates PDH activity glucose oxidation heart via increasing expression Pdk4, gene encoding PDHK4. address question, differentiated H9c2 myoblasts cardiac myocytes modulated FoxO1 activity, Pdk4/PDHK4 expression PDH phosphorylation/activity assessed. assessed binding FoxO1 Pdk4 promoter cardiac myocytes conjunction measuring role FoxO1 glucose oxidation isolated working heart. pharmacological (1 microM AS1842856) genetic (siRNA mediated) inhibition FoxO1 decreased Pdk4/PDHK4 expression subsequent PDH phosphorylation H9c2 cardiac myocytes, whereas 10 microM dexamethasone-induced Pdk4/PDHK4 expression abolished via pretreatment 1 microM AS1842856. Furthermore, transfection H9c2 cardiac myocytes vector expressing FoxO1 increased luciferase activity driven Pdk4 promoter construct containing FoxO1 DNA-binding element region, Pdk4 promoter construct lacking region. Finally, AS1842856 treatment fasted mice enhanced glucose oxidation rates aerobic isolated working heart perfusions. Taken together, FoxO1 directly regulates Pdk4 transcription heart, thereby controlling PDH activity subsequent glucose oxidation rates.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although studies shown association FoxO1 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression, study demonstrated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 direct transcriptional target FoxO1 (but FoxO3/FoxO4) heart. Furthermore, report here, first time, FoxO1 inhibition increases glucose oxidation isolated working mouse heart.
