 PK-LR gene studied 12 unrelated patients red cell pyruvate kinase deficiency hereditary nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia (CNSHA). entire codifying region R-type PK gene flanking intronic regions analysed single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed direct sequencing abnormal DNA. 10 different mutations identified 22/24 alleles risk. Eight missense mutations caused following single amino acid changes: G514C (172Glu-Gln), G1010A (337Arg-Gln), G1015C (339Asp-Gln), T1070C (357Ile-Thr), C1223T (408Thr-Ile), G1291A (431Ala-Thr), C1456T (486Arg-Trp) G1595A (532Arg-Gln). Two nonsense mutations: G721T (241Glu-Stop) C1675T (559Arg-Stop). 7/22 alleles demonstrated C1456 --> mutation. study polymorphic site nucleotide (nt) 1705 performed cases disclosed 1705 C/C mutation 10 1705 A/C mutation three. first report presence several different L-type PK gene mutations within Spanish population. Furthermore, PK gene mutations found, six unique previously described (1015C, 1070C, 1223T, 1291A, 1595A 1675T) one (C1456T) seems predominant Spain. Interestingly, case 1529A mutation commonly found Northern European populations present here.
