 Signal transduction mechanisms activated early stages necrotic cell death poorly characterized. recently identified Sterile 20 (Ste20)-like oxidant stress response kinase-1, SOK-1, member Ste20 kinase family. report SOK-1 markedly activated early 20 min chemical anoxia induced exposure Madin-Darby canine kidney LLC-PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) one three inhibitors electron transport chain, cyanide (CN), rotenone, antimycin A. Since oxidant stress activates SOK-1, postulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced electron transport chain chemical anoxia, might responsible SOK-1 activation. time course CN/2-DG-induced SOK-1 activation production ROS, measured cells loaded dichlorofluorescein, compatible role ROS SOK-1 activation. Furthermore, preincubation LLC-PK1 cells three unrelated scavengers ROS, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, pyruvate, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, reduced cellular oxidant stress activation SOK-1 CN/2-DG. increase cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) necessary sufficient CN/2-DG-induced activation SOK-1. Preincubation cells BAPTA-AM prevented activation SOK-1. Incubation cells thapsigargin calcium ionophore, A23187, effect SOK-1 activity, preincubation cells either agents markedly enhanced CN/2-DG-induced activation SOK-1 (20-fold versus 7-fold). summary, chemical anoxia activates SOK-1 via oxidant stress-dependent mechanism critically dependent upon markedly amplified increase [Ca2+]i. requirement dual inputs oxidant stress increase [Ca2+]i may prevent inappropriate activation kinase milder degrees oxidant stress, insufficient generate increase [Ca2+]i. activation SOK-1 may one cell's earliest responses inducers necrotic cell death.
