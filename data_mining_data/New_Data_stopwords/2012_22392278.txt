 Filariasis causing nematode Brugia malayi shown harbor wolbachia bacteria symbionts. sequenced genome wolbachia endosymbiont B.malayi (wBm) offers unprecedented opportunity identify new wolbachia drug targets. Genome analysis glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway revealed wBm lacks pyruvate kinase (PK) may instead utilize enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK; ATP: pyruvate, orthophosphate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.9.1). PPDK catalyses reversible conversion AMP, PPi phosphoenolpyruvate ATP, Pi pyruvate. organisms including mammals exclusively possess PK. Therefore absence PPDK mammals makes enzyme attractive wolbachia drug target. present study modeled three dimensional structure wBm PPDK. template 50% identity 67% similarity amino acid sequence employed homology-modeling approach. putative active site consists His476, Arg360, Glu358, Asp344, Arg112, Lys43 Glu346 selected site interest designing suitable inhibitor molecules. Docking studies carried using induced fit algorithms OPLS force field Schrodinger's Glide. lead molecules inhibit PPDK activity taken small molecule library (Pubchem database) interaction analysis showed compounds may inhibit function PPDK wBm.
