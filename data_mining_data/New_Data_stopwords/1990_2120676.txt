 UAS yeast gene encoding glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) contains several different sequence elements involved transcriptional activation. elements include activator core sequence, bound RAP1 protein, three copies pentamer sequence 5' CTTCC 3'. Upstream activator core sequence region (Yfp), identified site strong DNA-protein interaction. Yfp region contains consensus binding site factor ABF1. purified protein, binds Yfp region, homogeneity. protein migrates doublet SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparent molecular weight 125 KDa. properties similar ABF1. ABF1 synthesised vitro bound strongly Yfp region formed gel retardation complex identical mobility complex formed protein. UAS1 pyruvate kinase gene (PYK1) promoter contains RAP1 binding site single copy CTTCC sequence. identified ABF1 binding site close RAP1 binding site CTTCC sequence PYK1 promoter. site strongly bound ABF1 vitro. organisation PGK PYK1 UASs thus similar transcriptional silencer HMR(E) also contains sequences.
