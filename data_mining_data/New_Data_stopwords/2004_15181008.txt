 putative tumor metastasis suppressor protein Nm23-H1 nucleoside diphosphate kinase exhibits novel protein kinase activity bound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). study show glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase B (PGM) becomes phosphorylated presence Nm23-H1.GAPDH complex vitro. Mutation His-10 PGM abolishes Nm23-H1.GAPDH complex-induced phosphorylation. Nm23-H1, GAPDH, PGM known co-localize shown free flow isoelectric focusing. association Nm23-H1 GAPDH, PGM could activated dCTP, substrate Nm23-H1, addition well known PGM activator 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. synthetic cell-penetrating peptide (PGMtide) encompassing phosphorylated histidine several residues PGM (LIRHGE) promoted growth arrest several tumor cell lines, whereas proliferation tested non-tumor cells influenced. Analysis metabolic activity one tumor cell lines, MCF-7, indicated PGMtide inhibited glycolytic flux, consistent vivo inhibition PGM. specificity observed effect determined experimentally testing effect PGMtide cells growing presence pyruvate, helps compensate PGM inhibition glycolytic pathway. Thus, growth MCF-7 cells arrested PGMtide presence pyruvate. data presented provide evidence inhibition PGM activity achieved exogenous addition polypeptide, resulting inhibition glycolysis cell growth arrest cell culture.
