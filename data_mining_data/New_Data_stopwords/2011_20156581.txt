 Cell proliferation proceeds metabolism capable providing budget metabolic intermediates adequate ensure energy regeneration synthesis cell building blocks sufficient amounts. tumor cells, glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2, M2-PK) determines whether glucose converted lactate regeneration energy (active tetrameric form, Warburg effect) used synthesis cell building blocks (nearly inactive dimeric form). review discusses regulation mechanisms pyruvate kinase M2 expression different transcription factors well regulation pyruvate kinase M2 activity direct interaction certain oncoproteins, tyrosine serine phosphorylation, binding phosphotyrosine peptides, association glycolytic non glycolytic enzymes, promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein, well metabolic intermediates. intervention regulation mechanisms expression, activity tetramer dimer ratio pyruvate kinase M2 severe consequences metabolism well proliferation tumorigenic capacity cells makes enzyme promising target potential therapeutic approaches. quantification dimeric form pyruvate kinase M2 (Tumor M2-PK) plasma stool allows early detection tumors therapy control. Several different mechanisms may induce translocation pyruvate kinase M2 nucleus. role pyruvate kinase M2 nucleus complex witnessed evidence effect pro-proliferative well pro-apoptotic stimuli.
