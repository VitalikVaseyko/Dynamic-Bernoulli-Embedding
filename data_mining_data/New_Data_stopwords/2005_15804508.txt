 Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss injected intraperitoneally slow-release implants vegetable oil alone containing ovine growth hormone (oGH) (2 5 microgg(-1) body weight), sampled 5 days assess simultaneous effects GH osmoregulation carbohydrate metabolism. enhanced hypoosmoregulatory capacity oGH-implanted fish suggested increase observed gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, decrease observed plasma ion concentration (Na+ Cl-) osmolality. GH treatment also elicited increased plasma glucose levels metabolic changes liver, gills, kidney, brain. Major metabolic changes elicited GH treatment included (1) decreased glycolytic potential capacity exporting glucose liver, (2) enhanced glycogenolytic potential capacity use exogenous glucose gills kidney, well increased glycolytic capacity later tissue, (3) enhanced glycogenolytic glycolytic capacities brain. metabolic changes elicited GH treatment support role GH control carbohydrate metabolism salmonids could related either metabolic changes occurring osmotic acclimation nature (a process changes GH levels carbohydrate metabolism reported) metabolic changes associated growth.
