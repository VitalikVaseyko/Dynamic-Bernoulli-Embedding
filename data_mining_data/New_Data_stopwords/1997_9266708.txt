 Phosphoenolpyruvate (P-pyruvate) carboxylase ripened banana fruit purified near homogeneity final specific activity 20-23 U/mg protein; P-pyruvate carboxylase-kinase copurified P-pyruvate carboxylase throughout purification. Gel filtration FPLC indicated two proteins form tightly associated 425-kDa complex. 103-kDa 100-kDa subunits P-pyruvate carboxylase alpha2beta2 hetetrotetramer phosphorylated subsequently dephosphorylated vitro time-dependent manner final preparation incubated 0.1 mM [gamma-32P]ATP followed rabbit muscle protein phosphatase type 2A1. Phosphoamino acid phosphopeptide map analyses indicated vitro phosphorylation subunits likely occurs identical Ser residue. Maximal stoichiometry 32P incorporation 0.2 0.4 mol/mol 103-kDa 100-kDa subunit, respectively. level 32P incorporation correlated enzyme's activation state assayed suboptimal assay conditions (pH 7.3, 75 microM P-pyruvate, 0.2 mM L-malate). main kinetic effect phosphorylation decrease enzyme's Km(P-pyruvate), well sensitivity inhibition L-malate L-glutamate. Banana P-pyruvate carboxylase-kinase: (a) also phosphorylated maize leaf P-pyruvate carboxylase, histone III-S, dephosphorylated casein; (b) demonstrated Mg2+ dependence Ca2+ independence, (c) exhibited broad pH activity optimum pH 8.0-8.5, (d) inhibited L-malate activated Ba2+ Co2+. Time-course kinetic studies suggested P-pyruvate carboxylase exists mainly dephosphorylated form preclimacteric, climacteric postclimacteric fruit, kinase expressed throughout ripening. situ 32P-labeling indicated that, subunits ripe banana P-pyruvate carboxylase phosphorylated vivo, primarily 100-kDa subunit radiolabeled. results suggest similar enzyme leaves, root nodules seeds, fruit P-pyruvate carboxylase may subject regulatory seryl phosphorylation endogenous P-pyruvate carboxylase-kinase.
