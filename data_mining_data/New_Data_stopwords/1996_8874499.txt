 UL9 origin binding protein herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1). UL9-specific monoclonal antibody (17B) whose epitope maps N-terminal 33 amino acids used study localization UL9 infected transfected cells. demonstrate colocalization UL9 HSV-1 single-strand DNA binding protein (ICP8 UL29) replication compartments, sites viral DNA synthesis. hand, UL9 completely colocalize ICP8 prereplicative sites, structures observed conditions inhibit viral DNA polymerase. Cells transfected various deletion pyruvate kinase fusion constructs analyzed indirect immunofluorescence assay define nuclear localization signal (NLS) UL9. Deletion analysis showed region required nuclear localization lies within C-terminal DNA binding domian (amino acids 535-851). Various regions UL9 tested fusion constructs ability direct normally cytoplasmic chicken pyruvate kinase protein nucleus. fusion construct containing carboxy-terminal 107 residues (amino acids 745-851) localized efficiently nucleus, whereas fusion construct containing N-terminal 660 amino acids UL9 unable so. Mutations designed alter potential NLS sequence (793-KREFAGARFKLR-804) within C-terminal 107 residues result mutant UL9 protein falls localize efficiently nucleus. results suggest major NLS UL9 maps within C-terminal 107 amino acids.
