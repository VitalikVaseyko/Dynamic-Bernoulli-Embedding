 pharmacological interventions currently available provide neuroprotection patients suffering cardiac arrest. Dichloroacetate (DCA) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), increases cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production promoting influx pyruvate Krebs cycle. study, investigated effects DCA post-resuscitation neurological injury asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. Asphyxial cardiac arrest established endotracheal tube clamping. total 111 rats randomized 3 groups: Sham group, Control group DCA intervention group. Animals DCA intervention group intraperitoneally administered DCA loading dose 80 mg/kg 15 minutes return spontaneous circulation (ROSC), whereas rats Control group received equivalent volume saline. DCA treatment increased 3-day survival time, reduced neurologic deficit scores 24, 48 72 hours ROSC. also attenuated cellular apoptosis neuronal damage hippocampal cornuammonis 1 region hematoxylin-eosin staining TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. addition, DCA reduced messenger RNA expression TNF-alpha IL-1beta brain hippocampus cortex ROSC. Furthermore, DCA treatment significantly increased ATP production, PDH activity, decreased blood glucose, lactate brain pyruvate levels ROSC. results suggested DCA neuroprotective effects brain injury cardiac arrest, salutary effects associated increase mitochondrial energy metabolism brain activation PDH activity.
