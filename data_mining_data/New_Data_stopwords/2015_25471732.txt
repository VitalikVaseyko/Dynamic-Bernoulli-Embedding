 PURPOSE: unique metabolic profile cancer (aerobic glycolysis) attractive therapeutic target cancer. Dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, shown reverse glycolytic phenotype induce mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. present study, investigated effects S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) inhibition DCA-induced cell death underlying mechanisms breast cancer cells. METHODS: Cell death evaluated annexin V PI staining. synergistic effects DCA PF4708671 assessed isobologram analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) used suppressing gene expression. mRNA protein levels measured RT-PCR Western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: PF4708671, selective inhibitor S6K1, knockdown S6K1 specific siRNA enhanced DCA-induced cell death. Interestingly, combination DCA/PF4708671 markedly reduced protein expression glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase 2 (HK2). Suppression HK2 activity using specific siRNA 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) enhanced cell sensitivity DCA/PF4708671. Overexpression Myc-tagged HK2 rescued cell death induced DCA/PF4708671. CONCLUSIONS: Based findings, propose inhibition S6K1, combination glycolytic inhibitor, DCA, provides effective cancer therapy.
