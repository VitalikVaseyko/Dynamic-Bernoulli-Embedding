 measured pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities right left ventricles fetal, maternal, nonpregnant adult sheep exposed high altitude (3,820 m) 112 days compared control groups animals kept sea level. Enzymes assayed spectrophotometric appearance reaction products specific enzyme, activity expressed micromoles per minute per gram wet weight tissue. control sheep, CS activity significantly higher ventricles pregnant nonpregnant adult compared fetus. However, LDH PK activities higher left ventricle nonpregnant adult compared fetus. Long-term hypoxemia significantly increased LDH activities fetal (57 53%), pregnant adult (29 27%), non-pregnant adult (25 24%) right left ventricles, respectively. CS activities also increased fetal (90 97%), pregnant adult (43 39%), nonpregnant adult (46 48%) right left ventricles, respectively. However, PK activity affected altitude group animals. fetal heart, uses lactate primary metabolic fuel, enzyme changes may help enhance aerobic energy production hypoxemia. adult heart, relies free fatty acids well glucose energy production, significance enzyme changes less clear.
