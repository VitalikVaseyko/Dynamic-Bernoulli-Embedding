 Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) vital enzyme glycolytic pathway, catalyze interconversion glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). DHAP involved lipid metabolism phospholipid synthesis. order know role TPI WSSV infection prawn, cloned full length cDNA triosephosphate isomerase gene (EcTPI) Exopalaemon carinicauda, function WSSV infection analyzed. EcTPI transcripts widely distributed tissues, showed relatively higher expression levels gill epidermis. expression apparently up-regulated 24 h post WSSV injection (hpi), virus load began rise. Furthermore, detected expressions key genes encoding enzymes catalyze key steps glycolysis WSSV infection. data showed genes encoding enzymes catalyzed upper steps glycolysis produce GAP, including hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), significantly up-regulated 24 27 hpi. Genes encoding enzymes catalyzing steps glycolysis GAP, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase (ENO) pyruvate kinase (PK), apparent down-regulated 24 27 hpi. Meanwhile, gene encoding enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzing DHAP glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) showed down-regulation 12-27 hpi, gene encoding dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) catalyzing DHAP synthesis phospholipids showed up-regulation 12-24 hpi. data suggested WSSV infection could change glycolysis pathway make produce phospholipids could helpful virus replication. order confirm speculation, dsRNA interference (RNAi) approach used knock EcTPI gene analyze effect WSSV load prawn. data showed interference EcTPI gene led significant decrease WSSV loads WSSV infected prawn. data provided useful information understand infection mechanism WSSV.
