 eukaryotic evolution, ribosomes considerably increased size, forming surface-exposed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shell unknown function, may create interface yet uncharacterized interacting proteins. investigate protein interactions, establish ribosome affinity purification method unexpectedly identifies hundreds ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) categories including metabolism cell cycle, well RNA- protein-modifying enzymes functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes. characterizing RAPs, discover presence ufmylation, metazoan-specific post-translational modification (PTM), ribosomes define direct substrates. Moreover, show metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), interacts sub-pools endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes, exerting non-canonical function RNA-binding protein translation ER-destined mRNAs. Therefore, RAPs interconnect one life's ancient molecular machines diverse cellular processes, providing additional layer regulatory potential protein expression.
