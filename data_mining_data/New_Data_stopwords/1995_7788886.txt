 investigate whether energy derived glycolysis functionally coupled Ca2+ active transport sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), determined whether glycolytic enzymes associated SR membranes whether metabolism enzymes capable supporting 45Ca transport. Sealed right-side-out SR vesicles isolated step sucrose gradient rabbit skeletal cardiac muscle. Intravesicular 45Ca transport measured addition glycolytic substrates cofactors specific glycolytic reactions studied addition exogenous ATP expressed transport sensitive specific Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. found entire chain glycolytic enzymes aldolase onward, including aldolase, GAPDH, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase (PK), associated SR vesicles cardiac skeletal muscle. Iodoacetic acid, inhibitor GAPDH, eliminated 45Ca transport supported fructose-1,6-diphosphate, substrate aldolase, transport completely restored phosphoenolpyruvate (the substrate PK), indicating ATP-producing glycolytic enzymes, GAPDH/PGK PK, associated SR functionally capable providing ATP Ca2+ pump. Addition soluble hexokinase ATP trap eliminated 45Ca transport fueled exogenous ATP markedly less effect 45Ca transport supported endogenously produced ATP (via glycolysis). Similarly, low concentrations ATP ADP (10 50 nmol/L), ATP produced endogenously ADP phosphoenolpyruvate supported 15-fold 45Ca transport ATP supplied exogenously concentration. results consistent functional coupling glycolytic ATP Ca2+ transport support hypothesis ATP generated SR-associated glycolytic enzymes may play important role cellular Ca2+ homeostasis driving SR Ca2+ pump.
