 bivalve molluscs digestive gland (hepatopancreas) plays central role metabolism. work, effects 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) digestive gland evaluated Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels injected adductor muscle sinus different amounts hormone (5, 25 100pmol) tissues sampled 24h post-injection. Functional parameters (lysosomal membrane stability-LMS, lysosomal accumulation neutral lipids-NL lipofuscin-LF), well activity key glycolytic enzymes PFK (phosphofructokinase) PK (pyruvate kinase), antioxidant enzyme catalase evaluated. Selected genes, whose expression modulated estrogens mammalian systems whose sequences identified Mytilus, investigated possible targets action E(2). E(2) induced concentration-dependent decrease LMS; effect accompanied increase NL accumulation, whereas level lipofuscin showed slight, although significant decrease. E(2) exposure also led significant increase activity PFK catalase PK. Moreover, E(2) induced significant changes pattern gene expression lower concentrations tested (5 25pmol) evaluated quantitative RT-PCR. particular, increased transcription catalase, well metallothionein 20 (MT20) isoform observed; hand, decreased transcription p53 gene detected. results demonstrate Mytilus digestive gland represents target action E(2), hormone modulate lysosomal function, well lipid glucose metabolism. Moreover, data suggest E(2) may also alter oxidative stress conditions tissue, indicated increased transcription genes (metallothionein catalase) play role antioxidant defences. Overall, results indicate E(2) modulate functional parameters gene expression mussel hepatopancreas underline importance investigating also non-reproductive effects estrogenic compounds bivalve molluscs.
