 accumulation unhealthy mitochondria results mitochondrial dysfunction, implicated aging, cancer, variety degenerative diseases. However, mechanism mitochondrial quality regulated remains unclear. Here, show Mieap, novel p53-inducible protein, induces intramitochondrial lysosome-like organella plays critical role mitochondrial quality control. Mieap expression directly regulated p53 frequently lost human cancer result DNA methylation. Mieap dramatically induces accumulation lysosomal proteins within mitochondria mitochondrial acidic condition without destroying mitochondrial structure (designated MALM, Mieap-induced accumulation lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria) response mitochondrial damage. MALM related canonical autophagy. MALM involved degradation oxidized mitochondrial proteins, leading increased ATP synthesis decreased reactive oxygen species generation. results suggest Mieap induces intramitochondrial lysosome-like organella plays critical role mitochondrial quality control eliminating oxidized mitochondrial proteins. Cancer cells might accumulate unhealthy mitochondria due p53 mutations and/or Mieap methylation, representing potential cause Warburg effect.
