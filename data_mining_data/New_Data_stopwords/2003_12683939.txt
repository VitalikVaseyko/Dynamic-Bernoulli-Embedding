 recently shown conditions known activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) primary beta-cells trigger apoptosis. present study demonstrates also case MIN6 beta-cell line, used investigate underlying mechanism. Sustained activation AMPK induced culture adenosine analogue AICA-riboside low glucose concentrations. conditions induced sequential activation AMPK, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) caspase-3. effects AMPK JNK activation apoptosis demonstrated adenoviral expression constitutively active AMPK, condition reproduced earlier-described AMPK-dependent effects pyruvate kinase acetyl-coA-carboxylase. effects JNK activation apoptosis demonstrated observations (i). inhibition dicumarol prevented caspase-3 activation apoptosis, (ii). adenoviral expression JNK-interacting scaffold protein JIP-1/IB-1 increased AICA-riboside-induced JNK activation apoptosis. primary beta-cells, AMPK activation also found activate JNK, involving primarily JNK 2 (p54) isoform. concluded prolonged stimulation AMPK induce apoptosis insulin-producing cells activation pathway involves JNK, subsequently, caspase-3.
