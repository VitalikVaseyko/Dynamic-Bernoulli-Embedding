 Liver cancer second cause death cancer worldwide, without effective treatment. Traditional chemotherapy liver cancer big side effects patients, whereas targeted drugs, sorafenib, commonly drug resistance. Oroxylin (OA) main bioactive flavonoids Scutellariae radix, strong anti-hepatoma effect low toxicity normal tissue. date, differentiation-inducing agents reported exert curative effect solid tumors. results demonstrated OA restrained proliferation induced differentiation hepatoma vitro vivo, via inducing high PKM1 (pyruvate kinase M1)/PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) ratio. addition, inhibited expression polypyrimidine tract-binding protein OA charge decrease PKM2 increase PKM1. studies demonstrated increased PKM1 translocated nucleus bound HNF-4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) directly, promoting transcription HNF-4alpha-targeted genes. work suggested OA increased PKM1/PKM2 ratio, resulting HNF-4alpha activation hepatoma differentiation. Especially, OA showed reliable anticancer effect human primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells patient-derived tumor xenograft model hepatoma, slowed development primary hepatoma, suggesting OA could developed novel differentiation inducer agent hepatoma.
