 method localization pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type L, M2 M1 tissue sections described. Mono-specific antibodies directed isoenzymes pyruvate kinase chicken peroxidase antiperoxidase method used. following preferential localizations isoenzymes chicken tissues observed: Pyruvate kinase M1 found skeletal muscle. white muscle fibers intensely stained red. dark muscles (e.g., anterior latissimus dorsi) heart muscle showed reaction antiserum pyruvate kinase M1. Pyruvate kinase type L found hepatocytes kidney cortex. Pyruvate kinase type M2 seen distal tubules kidney, hepatocytes sinusoidal cells liver, lung, adipose tissue, spleen mainly bursa dependent areas. Pyruvate kinase type M2 detected high concentrations granulation tissue regenerating liver partial hepatectomy. Liver sections hen bearing pancreatic tumor showed unusually high content pyruvate kinase type M2 hepatocytes, clustered spots liver parenchyma. Thus, contrary previous reports, tissue distribution isoenzymes chicken similar vertebrates.
