 FKBP-12, 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (neuroimmunophilin), acts receptor immunosuppressant drug FK506. Neuroimmunophilins, including FKBP-12, abundant brain shown involved reversing neuronal degeneration preventing cell death. report, utilized several analytical techniques, situ hybridization, Western blotting, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry study transcriptional expression well protein levels FKBP-12 unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model Parkinson's disease. FKBP-12 protein also detected directly brain tissue sections using mass spectrometry profiling. found increased levels FKBP-12 mRNA protein dorsal middle part 6-OHDA lesioned striatum. Thus, studies clearly demonstrate FKBP-12 increased brain common animal model Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, identified potential binding partners FKBP-12 may implicated pathophysiology Parkinson's disease, alpha-enolase, 14-3-3 zeta/delta, pyruvate kinase isozymes, heat shock protein 70, using surface plasmon resonance sensor technology combination mass spectrometry. conclusion, data strongly suggests FKBP-12 altered experimental model PD.
