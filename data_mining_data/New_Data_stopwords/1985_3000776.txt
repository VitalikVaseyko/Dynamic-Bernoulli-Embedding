 involvement 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate [Fru(2,6)P2] pyruvate kinase insulin-dependent short-term activation glycolysis studied primary cultures rat hepatocytes. short-term influence insulin parameters dependent insulin concentration used long-term culture. Cells cultured either 10 nM 0.1 nM insulin 48 h, referred 'insulin cells' 'control cells', respectively. Insulin cells exhibited high level Fru(2,6)P2. Addition insulin insulin cells led immediate stimulation glycolysis (two-fold) activation pyruvate kinase. concentration Fru(2,6)P2 activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase remained constant. Control cells exhibited low level Fru(2,6)P2 low activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase directly medium change. However, parameters increased 1-2-h incubation absence insulin. Although level Fru(2,6)P2 thus changed tenfold glycolytic rate remained constant value. Addition insulin control cells led 5-8-fold stimulation glycolysis 30-90-min lag phase. lag period insulin strongly increased sequentially 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, level Fru(2,6)P2 pyruvate kinase activity. activation latter enzyme slightly preceded onset insulin-stimulated glycolysis. Addition insulin control cells, preincubated 3 h absence insulin Fru(2,6)P2 level risen insulin-independently, led immediate increase glycolysis without lag phase. concluded insulin-sensitive cell system: changes glycolytic flux correlate changes level total Fru(2,6)P2 either insulin control cells; increase Fru(2,6)P2 concentration obligatory insulin-dependent stimulation glycolysis insulin cells; activation pyruvate kinase thus glycolysis insulin proceed unless Fru(2,6)P2 level elevated threshold level. lack correlation total Fru(2,6)P2 levels glycolytic flux apparent existence threshold concentration Fru(2,6)P2 suggest permissive action effector enzyme interconversion.
