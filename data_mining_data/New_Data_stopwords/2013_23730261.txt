 Metabolism involved directly indirectly processes conducted living cells. brain, popularly viewed neuronal-glial complex, gets energy oxygen-dependent metabolism glucose, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays key regulatory role oxidation glucose. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (also called PDC kinase PDK) kinase regulates glucose metabolism switching PDC. Four isoforms PDKs tissue specific activities identified. metabolisms neurons glial cells, especially, astroglial cells, interrelated, cells function integrated fashion. energetic coupling neuronal astroglial cells essential meet energy requirements brain efficient way. Accumulating evidence suggests alterations PDKs and/or neuron-astroglia metabolic interactions associated development several neurological disorders. Here, authors review results recent research efforts shed light functions PDKs nervous system, particularly neuron-glia metabolic interactions neuro-metabolic disorders.
