 majority tumors express isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, type tumor M2. isoenzyme exists active tetrameric less active dimeric form. dimeric form strongly overexpressed tumor cells new tumor marker thus called tumor M2-PK. isoenzyme released tumor cells quantitatively detectable body fluids sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). establish ELISA routine diagnostic clinical laboratory, sample stability evaluated. Therefore, blood samples collected different ways healthy donors. Reproducibility tumor M2-PK detection EDTA-plasma affected day day 'stress' clinical routine (e.g. shaking, leaving samples room temperature several hours without prior centrifugation). Similar results obtained citrate-plasma, whereas detection serum heparin-plasma reproducible blood samples centrifuged within 2 hrs collection. appears lymphocytes contain small amounts tumor M2-PK isoenzyme. might release tumor M2-PK heparin-plasma serum samples, EDTA-plasma samples. results indicated EDTA-plasma appears appropriate routine diagnostic tumor M2-PK tumor marker.
