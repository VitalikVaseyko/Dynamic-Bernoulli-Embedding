 Although respiration principal cause loss sucrose postharvest sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.), internal mechanisms control root respiration rate unknown. Available evidence, however, indicates respiration rate likely controlled availability respiratory substrates, glycolysis central role generating substrates. determine glycolytic changes occur sugarbeet roots harvest elucidate relationships glycolysis respiration, sugarbeet roots stored 60 days, activities glycolytic enzymes concentrations glycolytic substrates, intermediates, cofactors, products determined. Respiration rate also determined, relationships respiration rate glycolytic enzymes metabolites evaluated. Glycolysis highly variable storage, 10 14 glycolytic activities 14 17 glycolytic metabolites significantly altered storage. Changes glycolytic enzyme activities metabolites occurred throughout 60 day storage period, greatest first 4 days harvest. Positive relationships changes glycolytic enzyme activities root respiration rate abundant, 10 14 enzyme activities elevated root respiration elevated 9 glycolytic activities static periods unchanging respiration rate. Major roles pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase regulation postharvest sugarbeet root glycolysis indicated based changes enzymatic activities concentrations substrates products. Additionally, strong positive relationship respiration rate pyruvate kinase activity found indicating downstream TCA cycle enzymes unlikely regulate restrict root respiration major way. Overall, results establish glycolysis static sugarbeet root storage changes glycolysis closely related changes sugarbeet root respiration.
