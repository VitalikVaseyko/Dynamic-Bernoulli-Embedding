 Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic phenotype, known Warburg effect, characterized high rates glucose uptake glycolysis, even aerobic conditions. Warburg effect appears intrinsic component cancers evidence linking cancer progression mutations, translocations, alternative splicing genes directly code downstream effects key metabolic enzymes. Many signaling pathways routinely dysregulated cancer number important oncogenic signaling pathways play important regulatory roles central carbon metabolism. Unraveling complex regulatory relationship cancer metabolism signaling requires application systems biology approaches. discuss computational approaches modeling protein signal transduction metabolism well regulatory relationship two important cellular processes combined hybrid models.
