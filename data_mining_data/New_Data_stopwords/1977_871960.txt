 single-dose administration 6-hydroxydopamine (50 mg/kg body weight, sc) infant rats resulted enlargement, higher fresh weight, markedly elevated lipid content, higher total protein content interscapular cervical brown adipose tissue. protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) activation ratio tissue decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) activity. Fatty acid synthetase, hand, showed increased activity. changes commenced soon 24 h administration drug, fully developed 2-4 days later, persisted least 14 days. results line assumption 6-hydroxydopamine administration causes chemical sympathectomy brown adipose tissue. supported fact treatment alpha-methyltyrosine, known competively inhibit norepinephrine systhesis, results similar changes brown fat infant rats. Hence seems 6-hydroxydopamine administration offers simple inexpensive experimental model studies role norepinephrine-mediated sympathetic nervous system brown tissue function development.
