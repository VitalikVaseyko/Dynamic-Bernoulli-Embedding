 study compared effects dietary whey protein dietary casein soy protein glycogen storage glycoregulatory enzyme activities liver sedentary exercise-trained rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (ca. 130 g) divided one sedentary three exercise-trained groups, eight animals group. Casein provided source dietary protein sedentary group exercise-trained groups fed casein, whey, soy protein. Rats exercise-trained groups ran 30 mins/day, 4 days/week motor-driven treadmill. exercise-trained rats, animals fed whey protein higher liver glycogen content animals two diet groups. Glucokinase activity significantly higher rats fed whey protein compared rats fed soy protein, glucose 6-phosphatase activity significantly decreased animals whey protein diet compared two diets. Although 6-phospho-fructokinase activity significantly lower whey protein group soy protein group, found fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity significantly higher whey group compared either casein soy groups. Pyruvate kinase activity rats fed casein diet significantly higher rats fed either whey soy protein diets. addition, hepatic alanine aminotransferase activity serum alanine level also increased whey protein group compared casein soy protein groups. Taken together, results demonstrate whey protein diet exercise-trained rats results significantly higher levels liver glycogen, combined effects regulation rate limiting glycolytic gluconeogenic enzyme activities activation glycogenesis alanine via alanine amino-transferase.
