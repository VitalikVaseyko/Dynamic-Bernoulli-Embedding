 objective present study investigate association diabetes mellitus colorectal carcinogenesis well possible mechanism involved interaction. Diabetes rat models induced low dose STZ followed low dose DMH induce colorectal cancer. formation ACF colon incidence, number size tumors measured. activity glycolytic enzymes colonic tissues also measured. results demonstrated total number ACF number foci contain different number crypts increased diabetic rats. end experimental treatment, incidence, number size tumors also increased diabetic rats. Overall, data indicated diabetes increased risk colorectal cancer. activity HK PK colonic tissues increased diabetic rats, whereas activity PDH decreased. addition, activities enzymes intratumor higher peritumor. data indicated high rate glycolysis may play role colorectal carcinogenesis diabetic rats.
