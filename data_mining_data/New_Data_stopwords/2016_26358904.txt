 Vertebrate retinas several characteristics make particularly interesting metabolic perspective. retinas highly laminated structure, high energy demands, share several metabolic features tumors, strong Warburg effect abundant pyruvate kinase M2 isoform expression. energy demands retinas qualitatively quantitatively different light darkness metabolic dysfunction could cause retinal degeneration. Stable isotope-based metabolic analysis mass spectrometry powerful tool trace dynamic metabolic reactions reveal novel metabolic pathways within cells cells retina. Here, describe methods quantify retinal metabolism intact retinas discuss applications methods understanding neuron-glia interaction, light dark adaptation, retinal degenerative diseases.
