 review describes recent experimental data importance VDAC-cytoskeleton interactions determining mechanisms energy metabolite transfer mitochondria cytoplasm cardiac cells. intermembrane space mitochondrial creatine kinase connects VDAC adenine nucleotide translocase ATP synthase complex, cytoplasmic side VDAC linked cytoskeletal proteins. Applying immunofluorescent imaging Western blot analysis shown beta2-tubulin coexpressed mitochondria highly important cardiac muscle cells mitochondrial metabolism. Since shown Rostovtseva et al. alphabeta-heterodimer tubulin binds VDAC decreases permeability, suppose beta-tubulin subunit bound cytoplasmic side alpha-tubulin C-terminal tail inserted VDAC. cytoskeletal proteins, plectin desmin may involved process. result VDAC-cytoskeletal interactions selective restriction channel permeability adenine nucleotides creatine phosphocreatine favors energy transfer via phosphocreatine pathway. types cancer cells interactions altered favoring hexokinase binding thus explaining Warburg effect increased glycolytic lactate production cells. article part Special Issue entitled: VDAC structure, function, regulation mitochondrial metabolism.
