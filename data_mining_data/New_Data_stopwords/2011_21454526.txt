 previously shown mu-opioid receptor (MOR) capable mediating cross-desensitization several chemokine receptors including CCR5, biochemical mechanism process fully elucidated. carried series functional biochemical studies found mechanism MOR-induced cross-desensitization CCR5 involves activation PKCzeta. Inhibition PKCzeta pseudosubstrate inhibitor, siRNA, dominant negative mutants suppresses cross-desensitization CCR5. results indicate activation PKCzeta mediated pathway involving phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). addition, activation MOR elevates phosphorylation level kinase activity PKCzeta. phosphorylation PKCzeta suppressed dominant negative mutant PDK1. observed following MOR activation, interaction PKCzeta PDK1 immediately increased based analysis fluorescent resonance energy transfer cells expression PKCzeta-YFP PDK1-CFP. addition, cells expressing PKCzeta kinase motif mutants (Lys-281, Thr-410, Thr-560) fail exhibit full MOR-induced desensitization CCR5 activity. Taken together, propose upon DAMGO treatment, MOR activates PKCzeta PDK1-dependent signaling pathway induce CCR5 phosphorylation desensitization. CCR5 highly proinflammatory receptor, critical coreceptor HIV-1, results may provide novel approach development specific therapeutic agents treat patients certain inflammatory diseases AIDS.
