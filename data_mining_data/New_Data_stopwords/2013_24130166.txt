 oncogenes MYCN survivin (BIRC5) maintain aggressiveness diverse cancers including sarcomas. investigate whether oncogenes cooperate initial malignant transformation, transduced Rat-1 fibroblasts. Indeed, survivin enhanced MYCN-driven contact-uninhibited anchorage-independent growth vitro. Importantly, upon subcutaneous transplantation mice, cells overexpressing instead either one oncogenes generated tumors shortened latency, marked anaplasia increased proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio resulting accelerated growth. Mechanistically, increased tumorigenicity associated enhanced Warburg effect hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha linked vascular remodeling. cooperation MYCN survivin may important genesis several cancers.
