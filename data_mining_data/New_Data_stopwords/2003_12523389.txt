 L-Lysine manufactured using Corynebacterium glutamicum 40 years. Nowadays production exceeds 600,000 tons per year. Based conventionally bred strains, improvement lysine productivity achieved genetic engineering. Pyruvate carboxylase, aspartate kinase, dihydrodipicolinate synthase, homoserine dehydrogenase specific lysine exporter shown key enzymes lysine production characterized detail. combined engineering led striking increase lysine formation. Pathway modeling data emerging 13C-isotope experiments revealed coordinated flux pentose phosphate cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle intensive futile cycling C3 compounds glycolysis C4 compounds tricarboxylic acid cycle. Process economics optimized developing repeated fed-batch techniques technical continuous fermentations. addition, on-line metabolic pathway analysis flow cytometry may help improve fermentation performance. Finally, availability Corynebacterium glutamicum genome sequence major impact improvement biotechnological manufacture lysine. context, genes carbon flow sugar uptake lysine secretion identified accessible manipulation. whole sequence information gives access post genome technologies transcriptome analysis, investigation proteome active metabolic network. multi-parallel working technologies accelerate generation knowledge. first time chance understanding overall picture physiological state lysine overproduction technical environment.
