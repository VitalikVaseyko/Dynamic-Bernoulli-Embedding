 early stages development Aspergillus niger conidia outgrowth explored combining genome-wide gene expression analysis (RNAseq), proteomics, Warburg manometry uptake studies. Resting conidia suspended water demonstrated first time metabolically active low levels oxygen uptake generation carbon dioxide detected, suggesting low-level respiratory metabolism occurs conidia maintenance. Upon triggering spore germination, generation CO2 increased dramatically. short period, coincided mobilisation intracellular polyol, trehalose, increase uptake O2 indicating trehalose metabolised fermentation. Data genome-wide mRNA profiling showed presence transcripts associated fermentative respiratory metabolism resting conidia. Following triggering conidial outgrowth, clear switch respiration 25min, confirmed cyanide inhibition. effect SHAM, salicylhydroxamic acid, respiration suggests electron flow via cytochrome c oxidase. Glucose entry spores detectable 1h triggering germination. impact sorbic acid germination examined showed inhibits glucose uptake. O2 uptake also inhibited, delaying onset respiration extending period fermentation. conclusion, show conidia suspended water completely dormant conidial outgrowth involves fermentative metabolism precedes respiration.
