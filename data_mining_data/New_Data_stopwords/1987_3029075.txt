 energy requirement protein translocation across membrane studied inverted membrane vesicles Escherichia coli strain lacks components F1F0-ATPase. ompF-lpp chimeric protein used model secretory protein. Translocation chimeric protein membrane vesicles totally inhibited presence carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) valinomycin nigericin partially inhibited either valinomycin nigericin alone added. Depletion ATP glucose hexokinase resulted complete inhibition translocation process, inhibition suppressed addition ATP-generating systems phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase creatine phosphate-creatine kinase. results indicate proton motive force ATP required translocation process. results suggest membrane potential chemical gradient protons (delta pH), proton motive force composed, participate translocation process.
