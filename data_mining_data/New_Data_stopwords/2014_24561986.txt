 OBJECTIVES: aim study explore possible role HIF-1alpha glucose metabolism, proliferation apoptosis pancreatic cancerous cells. METHOD: pancreatic cancerous BxPC-3 cells cultured normoxia hypoxia (3% O2), respectively. Cell proliferation determined MTT assay, apoptosis determined Annexin V/PI staining. Expression Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) citrate synthase (CS) determined Western-blot Realtime PCR. RESULTS: hypoxia, expression HIF-1alpha lactate production increased. expression glucose metabolic enzymes PDK1, LDHA, PKM2 also increased compared aerobic condition. Hypoxia treatment little effect expression CS. hypoxia, knockdown HIF-1alpha inhibited production lactate expression PDK1, LDHA PKM2. Knockdown HIF-1alpha repressed growth pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 cells induced apoptosis cells hypoxia. CONCLUSION: hypoxia, expression HIF-1alpha induced, leading increase glycolysis BxPC-3 cells possibly upregulation enzymes related glycolysis. HIF-1alpha knockdown inhibit prolife ratio promote apoptosis pancreatic cancerous BxPC-3 cells vitro.
