 Rapid depression Ca(2+)-uptake sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles inhibition activity creatine kinase (CK) pyruvate kinase (PK) observed incubation enzymes micromolar concentrations iron presence adenine nucleotides. effect iron dependent redox state iron determined redox state environment. Redox conditions generated Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio close 1 effective depressing Ca(2+)-uptake SR vesicles. Redox conditions decreased Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio oxidizing iron effective depressing CK activity redox conditions significantly increased Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio reducing iron effective depressing PK activity. iron sensitive enzymes possessed N-etylmaleimide (NEM) sensitive sulphydryl groups essential activity. sensitivity inhibition NEM increased order: PK < Ca(2+)-uptake < CK. Iron initiated depression CK PK activities reversible dithiothreitol (DTT). indicated modification SH groups important step mechanism iron depressed enzyme activity. Iron initiated depression Ca(2+)-uptake activity CK PK prevented allowing critical Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio reached binding iron desferroxamine EDTA. results, together data literature, led us suggest changes redox state cellular micro-environments, inevitably taking place ischemia reperfusion, may increase availability "low molecular weight iron" and, changes redox state iron, selectively initiate reversible depression several enzymes contain SH groups essential activity.
