 proton-pumping ATP hydrolysis activities ATP synthase Rhodobacter capsulatus compared function ADP P(i) concentrations. proton pumping measured either transmembrane pH difference probe, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine, transmembrane electric potential difference probe, bis(3-propyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol, obtaining consistent results. comparison indicates intrinsic uncoupling ATP synthase induced concentration either ligand decreased. half-maximal effect found submicromolar range ADP 70 microM P(i). proposed switch partially uncoupled state ATP synthase coupled state induced simultaneous binding ADP P(i).
