 variety cultural conditions examined determine relationship pyruvate kinase isozyme patterns morphology Mucor racemosus. results indicate M. racemosus two isozymes pyruvate kinase, form form B, clearly separable ion-exchange columns (diethylaminoethyl-cellulose). Addition glucose cultures growing amino acids air resulted induction form termination form B synthesis. Cycloheximide added time glucose blocked formation form interfere termination form B synthesis. Removal glucose resulted termination form synthesis induction form B. Cycloheximide blocked induction form B interfere termination form synthesis. data show isozyme type directly related morphology, depends presence absence glucose.
