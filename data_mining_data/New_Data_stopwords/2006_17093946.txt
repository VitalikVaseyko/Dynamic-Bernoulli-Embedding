 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Recent studies identified involvement inhibitor IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathogenesis insulin resistance. investigate mechanism involved, examined role nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), distal target IKK, hepatic glucose metabolism. METHODS: inhibit NF-kappaB activity, db/db mice infected adenovirus expressing IkappaBalpha super-repressor. RESULTS: IkappaBalpha super-repressor adenovirus infection caused moderate reduction NF-kappaB activity liver. treatment associated improved glucose tolerance, reduction serum insulin level, increased hepatic triacylglycerol glycogen contents, effect insulin-stimulated phosphorylation Akt. hand, quantification mRNA liver revealed marked reduction expression gluconeogenic genes, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose-6-phosphatase, concurrent reduced expression gene encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PPARGC1A, also known PGC-1alpha). Furthermore, production super-repressor IkappaBalpha suppressed increase blood glucose level pyruvate injection. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: results indicate moderate inhibition NF-kappaB improved glucose tolerance decreased gluconeogenesis associated reduced PGC-1alpha gene expression db/db mice, suggest inhibition NF-kappaB activity liver potentially suitable strategy normalisation blood glucose concentration type 2 diabetes.
