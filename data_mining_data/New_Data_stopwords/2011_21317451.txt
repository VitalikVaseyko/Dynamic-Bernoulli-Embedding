 key aberrant biological difference tumor cells normal differentiated cells altered metabolism, whereby cancer cells acquire number stable genetic epigenetic alterations retain proliferation, survive unfavorable microenvironments invade surrounding tissues. classic biochemical adaptation metabolic shift aerobic glycolysis rather mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, regardless oxygen availability, phenomenon termed "Warburg Effect". Aerobic glycolysis, characterized high glucose uptake, low oxygen consumption elevated production lactate, associated survival advantage well generation substrates fatty acids, amino acids nucleotides necessary rapidly proliferating cells. review discusses role key metabolic enzymes association aerobic glycolysis Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), aggressive, highly glycolytic deadly brain tumor. Targeting key metabolic enzymes involved modulating "Warburg Effect" may provide novel therapeutic approach either singularly combination existing therapies GBMs.
