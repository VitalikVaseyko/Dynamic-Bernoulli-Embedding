 BACKGROUND: Inflammation well-known etiological factor colorectal cancer, mechanisms underlying linkage inflammation cancer incompletely understood. hypothesized two pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha IL-17, might play role promoting colorectal carcinogenesis. Aerobic glycolysis metabolic adaptation promotes survival/proliferation cancer cells. Paracrine signaling tumor cells cancer-associated fibroblasts also plays role carcinogenesis. METHODS: effect TNFalpha IL-17 aerobic glycolysis growth factor production cultured human colorectal cancer cells investigated. Glucose utilization lactate production quantified measuring disappearance glucose appearance lactate culture medium. Glucose transporter glycolytic enzyme expression levels measured immunoblotting. RESULTS: TNFalpha IL-17 cooperatively stimulated glycolysis HT-29, T84, Caco-2 HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Treatment HT-29 cells TNFalpha plus IL-17 also increased expression HIF-1alpha c-myc, two factors know induce transcription genes encoding components glycolytic pathway. investigate mechanisms cytokine-stimulated glycolysis, effects TNFalpha IL-17 expression six members one regulator glycolytic pathway investigated. TNFalpha IL-17 cooperatively increased expression glucose transporter SLC2A1 hexokinase-2 regulate expression glucose transporter SLC2A3, enolase-1, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, 6-phoshofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3). Experiments inhibitors indicated HIF-1alpha played role induction SLC2A1 transcription factor NF-kappaB played role induction hexokinase-2 TNFalpha IL-17. TNFalpha IL-17 also synergistically stimulated production HT-29 cells growth factor simulated proliferation/survival NIL8 fibroblastic cells. activity factor specifically inhibited EGFR inhibitor AG1478, indicating EGFR ligand. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic inflammation known promote colorectal tumorigenesis. pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha IL-17 may contribute effect stimulating glycolysis growth factor production colorectal cancer cells.
