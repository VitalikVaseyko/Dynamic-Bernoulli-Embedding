 Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) previously identified tumor biomarker potential therapeutic target treatment cancer. present study, FFJ-3, structurally modified version mollugin, extract Traditional Chinese herbal medicine Rubia tinctorum (madder) used order determine anticancer activity compound investigate potential mechanisms underlying effect human cancer cells. results present study revealed FFJ-3 inhibited survival HepG2 human hepatoma cells, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells using MTT assay. addition, FFJ-3 arrested cell cycle progression G2/M G1 HepG2 A549 cells, respectively. analyses demonstrated FFJ-3 attenuated expression PKM2 protein via inhibition phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signaling pathway. Furthermore, treatment three cell types FFJ-3 significantly increased apoptosis decreased mitochondrial membrane potential compared untreated control group. addition, FFJ-3 treatment increased ratio B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2 associated X activated caspase-3 cascade. conclusion, inhibition PI3K/Akt signaling pathway activation caspase-3 cascade FFJ-3 primarily responsible inhibition cell proliferation induction apoptosis MCF-7, HepG2 A549 cells. results present study suggest potential therapeutic role FFJ-3 treatment human cancer.
