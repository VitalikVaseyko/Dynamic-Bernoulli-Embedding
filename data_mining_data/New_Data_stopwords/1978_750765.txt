 Irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs) sickle erythrocytes retain bipolar elongated shapes despite reoxygenation owe biophysical abnormalities acquired membrane alterations. Freeze-etched membranes ISCs produced vitro ISCs isolated vivo reveal microbodies fixed internal (PS) surface obscure spectrin filaments. Intramembranous particles (IMPs) intramembrane (PF) surface aggregate regions subsurface microbodies. Electron microscopy diaminobenzidine-treated ISC ghosts show microbodies contain hemoglobin and/or hemoglobin derivatives. Scanning electron microscopy freeze-etching demonstrate membrane--hemoglobin interaction ISCs enhances membrane loss microspherulation. Membrane-bound hemoglobin five times greater vivo ISCs non-ISCs, increases ISC production, parallelling depletion adenosine triphosphate.
