 Various enzyme activities involved active transport system, glycolysis, digestion assayed various parts gastrointestinal tracts germfree, conventional, gnotobiotic rats associated indigenous bacteria. activity levels alkaline phosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase, adenosine triphosphatase, disaccharidases upper small intestine highest parts gastrointestinal tracts various kinds gnotobiotic, conventional, germfree rats. Alkaline phosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase, adenosine triphosphatase activities upper small intestine germfree rats were, respectively, 2.3-, 2.9-, 1.7-fold higher conventional rats. Similar results enzymes, sucrase, maltase, trehalase, lactase activities upper small intestine germfree rats were, respectively, 1.6-, 1.5-, 2.3-, 1.8-fold higher conventional rats. various gnotobiotic rats, enzyme activity levels intermediate germfree conventional rats. findings suggest enzymatic activities strongly depressed association indigenous microorganisms epithelial mucosa upper small intestine rats. levels pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase activities highest, respectively, stomach, cecum, upper small intestine cecum parts gastrointestinal tracts various kinds gnotobiotic, conventional, germfree rats. also shown six kinds gastrointestinal bacteria, including lactobacilli, significantly depressed enzyme activity levels levels germfree conventional rats upper small intestine gnotobiotic rats.
