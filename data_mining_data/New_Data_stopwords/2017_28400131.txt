 Metabolic reprogramming immune evasion two hallmarks cancer. Metabolic reprogramming exemplified cancer's propensity utilize glucose exponential rate turn linked "aerobic glycolysis", popularly known "Warburg effect". Tumor glycolysis pivotal efficient management cellular bioenergetics uninterrupted cancer growth. Mounting evidence suggests tumor glycolysis also plays key role instigating immunosuppressive networks critical cancer cells escape immune surveillance ("immune evasion"). Recent data show induction cellular stress metabolic dysregulation sensitize cancer cells antitumor immune cells implying metabolic reprogramming immune evasion harmonize cancer progression. However, molecular link two hallmarks cancer remains obscure. review molecular intricacies tumor glycolysis facilitate immune evasion discussed light recent research explore immunotherapeutic potential targeting cancer metabolism.
