 Escherichia coli FB-04(pta1), recombinant L-tryptophan production strain, constructed laboratory. However, conversion rate (L-tryptophan yield per glucose) strain somewhat low. study, additional genes deleted effort increase conversion rate E. coli FB-04(pta1). Initially, pykF gene, encodes pyruvate kinase (PYKI), inactivated increase accumulation phosphoenolpyruvate, key L-tryptophan precursor. resulting strain, E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF, showed slightly higher L-tryptophan yield higher conversion rate fermentation processes. improve conversion rate, phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) disrupted deleting ptsH gene, encodes phosphocarrier protein (HPr). levels biomass, L-tryptophan yield, conversion rate strain, E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF/ptsH, especially low fed-batch fermentation process, even though achieved significant increase conversion rate shake-flask fermentation. resolve issue, four HPr mutations (N12S, N12A, S46A, S46N) introduced genomic background E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF/ptsH, respectively. Among them, strain harboring N12S mutation (E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF-ptsHN12S) showed prominently increased conversion rate 0.178 g g(-1) fed-batch fermentation; increase 38.0% compared parent strain E. coli FB-04(pta1). Thus, mutation genomic ptsH gene provided alternative method weaken PTS improve efficiency carbon source utilization.
