 Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) proton transporter/channel residing inner mitochondrial membrane involved cellular heat production. Using immunohistochemistry, investigated expression UCP1 UCP3 series 98 patients non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated surgery. Expression patterns correlated histopathological variables, prognosis, expression enzymes/proteins related cell metabolism. Bronchial epithelium express UCP1 UCP3, alveolar cells strongly expressed UCP1. tumors, strong expression UCP1 UCP3 recorded 43/98 (43.8%) 27/98 (27.6%) cases, respectively. UCP1 significantly associated squamous cell histology (P = 0.05), whilst UCP3 frequently overexpressed large cell carcinomas (P = 0.08), inversely related necrosis (P = 0.009). linear regression analysis, UCP1 directly related markers glycolysis [hexokinase (HXKII) phosphofructokinase (PFK1)] anaerobic glucose metabolism [pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH5)]. UCP3 directly linked glucose transporter (GLUT2), monocarboxylate transporter (MCT2), glycolysis markers (PFK1 aldolase), phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase (pPDH). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed UCP3 significantly related poor prognosis squamous cell carcinomas (P = 0.04). UCP1 UCP3 overexpressed large subgroup non-small cell lung tumors expression coincides increased glucose absorption, intensified glycolysis, anaerobic glucose usage. Whether UCPs targets therapeutic interventions lung cancer hypothesis demands investigation.
