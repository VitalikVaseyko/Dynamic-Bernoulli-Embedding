 test possibility pyruvate kinase proceeds via dissociative path, investigated whether complex enzyme . ADP . metaphosphate transiently formed complex enzyme . ATP. shown highly purified pyruvate kinase used, rate positional oxygen isotope exchange ATP (beta, gamma bridge beta nonbridge) 10(4) times slower absence cosubstrate pyruvate presence pyruvate. Further, rate racemization gamma-phospho group [gamma (S)-16O,17O,18O]-ATP undetectable, least 30 times slower even rate positional isotope exchange. tests thus provide evidence pyruvate kinase follows dissociative mechanism. Indeed, argued available data consistent associative path. Evidence presented single, associative, transition state symmetrical, bond making bond breaking processes rather precisely balanced.
