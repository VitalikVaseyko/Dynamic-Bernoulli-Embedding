 determined amounts number small molecules enzymes mother cell compartment developing forespore sporulation Bacillus megaterium. Significant amounts adenosine 5'-triphosphate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide present forespore compartment accumulation dipicolinic acid (DPA), compounds disappeared DPA accumulated. 3-Phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) accumulated within developing forespore, beginning 1 2 h DPA accumulation. Throughout development forespore contained constant levels enzymes 3-PGA synthesis (phosphoglycerate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) 3-PGA utilization (phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase) levels similar mother cell dormant spore. Despite presence enzymes 3-PGA utilization, compound stable within isolated forespores. Two acid-soluble proteins (A B proteins) also accumulated forespore, beginning 1 2 h DPA accumulation. time specific protease involved degradation B proteins germination also appeared, forespore compartment. Nevertheless, B proteins stable within isolated forespores. Arginine glutamic acid accumulated within forespore parallel DPA accumulation. forespore also contained enzyme arginase level similar mother cell level glutamic acid decarboxylase 2- 25-fold higher mother cell, depending sporulation forespores isolated. specific activities several enzymes (protease active hemoglobin, ornithine transcarbamylase, malate dehydrogenase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase) forespores 10% less values mother cell. Aminopeptidase present similar levels compartments; threonine deaminase found either compartment.
