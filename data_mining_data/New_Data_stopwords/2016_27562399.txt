 Glioblastoma multiforme common primary brain tumor, exhibits imbalance glioma cell growth glucose metabolism. Recent discoveries found multiple pathways downstream genes involved dysregulated metabolic pathway allow tumor manifest progress, critical patients glioblastoma associated significant systemic immunosuppression. Moreover, immune microenvironment considered major obstacle generating effective antitumor immune response. Therefore, identification patient-specific tumor antigens highly personalized approach, effective combination therapeutic modalities molecular agents targeting tumor metabolic oncogene addiction potent host immune modulators, may provide targets effective therapeutic strategies glioblastoma. review, aim highlight recent findings regarding glucose uptake proliferation, cell mobility expand investigations comprehensively examine different aspects glucose metabolism glioblastoma, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes, metabolic modulation genetics epigenetics key metabolic regulators, importantly, tumor cell-induced glucose deprivation inhibits T-cell glycolysis immunogenic functions. Furthermore, review concentrate discover effective drug targets regulate glucose metabolism tumor cell growth future glioblastoma therapies, challenges faced field metabolism tumor immune microenviroment.
