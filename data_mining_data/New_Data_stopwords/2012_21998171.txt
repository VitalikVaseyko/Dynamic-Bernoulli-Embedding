 Generally, knowledge mechanism regulating gene expression primary spermatocytes incomplete. used lactate dehydrogenase gene (Ldhc) model explore mechanisms spermatogenesis. 100-bp core promoter contained two essential elements common many genes, GC box CRE site. report results support model transcription factor MYBL1 acts coactivator directing tissue-specific expression via CRE cis element. hypothesize common mechanism involving activation multiple genes primary spermatocyte. MYBL1 expressed predominantly tissue-specific transcription factor spermatocytes breast epithelial cells. finding LDHC expression lost 21-day testes MYBL1 mutant mice supports hypothesis. GC1-spg germ cell line exogenous MYBL1 induces activity 4- 8-fold, although extracts cells show MYBL1 binding activity Myb consensus sequences Ldhc promoter EMSA. Rather, MYBL1 stimulates expression synthetic promoter containing CRE elements, suggesting MYBL1 activates promoter interacting protein binds CRE element. Mutation three Myb sites affect Ldhc promoter activity significantly (P > 0.05). CREB-binding protein (CBP) coactivator interacts CRE-binding protein CREB. show transactivation domain (TAD) MYBL1 interacts KIX domain CBP, TAD domain DNA binding domain MYBL1 interact CREB N-terminal domain. MYBL1 also stimulated expression testis-specific genes Pgk2 (phosphoglycerate kinase 2) Pdha2 (pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 2) promoters, contains CRE promoter elements expressed primary spermatocytes. propose MYBL1 directs germ cell-specific activation via CRE site certain genes activated specifically primary spermatocyte, although other, indirect effects MYBL1 remain possible explanation results.
