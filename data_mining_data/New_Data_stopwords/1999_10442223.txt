 protective effects Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) ischemic myocardium rats studied. Thirty Wistar rats (15 female 15 male) randomly divided 3 groups 10 animals each. Group A: control; group B: isoproternol (ISO); group C: ISO + BCAA. rats groups B received normal synthetic rat chow group C received BCAA supplement. two weeks dietary treatment, rats group injected saline groups B C injected ISO induced acute ischemic myocardial injury. 4 days injections either saline ISO, rats sacrificed. activities lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH), creatine kinase (CK), pyruvate kinase (PK) serum myocardium, concentrations potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+) myocardium measured. results showed activities LDH, GOT, alpha-HBDH, CK, PK serum myocardium significantly increased group B. addition, concentrations Ca2+ myocardium significantly increased. However, concentrations Mg2+ myocardium substantially decreased K+ group B slightly lowered. group C animals activities LDH, alpha-HBDH, PK, CK serum activities LDH, GOT, alpha-HBDH, CK myocardium significantly lower rats group B, significantly different control group. significant concentrations Ca2+ myocardium rats group C comparable control rats significantly lower rats group B. appeared BCAA effectively blocking increase Ca2+ myocardium without raising level Mg2+. concluded dietary supplement BCAA provided protective effects ischemic myocardium rats.
