 Cancer cells notorious metabolic adaptations hypoxic acidic conditions, especially highly elevated glycolytic rates tumor tissues. end product glycolysis lactate, molecule cells utilize instead glucose fuel respiration presence oxygen. could beneficial cells sufficient oxygen conserves glucose glycolysis. better quantify phenomenon develop diffusion-reaction mathematical model nutrient concentrations cancerous tissue surrounding single cylindrical microvessel. use model analyze interdependence cell populations' metabolic behaviors microscopic scale, specifically emerging paradigm metabolic symbiosis exists aerobic glycolytic cells. ATP turnover rates calculated function distance blood vessel, exhibit lactate-consuming population intermediate distances vessel. also consider ramifications Warburg effect cells utilize aerobic glycolysis along lactate-consuming respiration. also investigate effect inhibiting metabolic pathways cancer cells since insufficient ATP trigger cell apoptosis. Effects could induced metabolic inhibitors analyzed calculating total ATP turnover unit tissue annulus various parameter regimes correspond treatment conditions specific metabolic pathways knocked out. conclude therapies target glycolysis, e.g. lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors glycolytic enzyme inhibition, keys successful metabolic repression.
