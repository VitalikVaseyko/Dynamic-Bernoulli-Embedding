 Thin-layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis various rat tissues revealed three major isozymes (types L, M1 M2) various intermediate forms pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). vitro dissociation reassociation purified enzymes showed three major isozymes homotetrameric structures. L.M2 hybrids M1.M2 hybrids closely resembled naturally occurring intermediates; subunit structure intermediates isolated small intestine (form 3 form 4) estimated (L)2(M2)2 (L)(M2)3, respectively. Pyruvate kinase activity electrophoresis could estimated quantitatively densitometric measurements electrophoretic pattern. Type L activity fetal liver separated type R activity derived intrahepatic erythropoietic cells. changes three distinct steps development: increased late fetal period, remained steady neonatal period increased weaning. intermediates found extracts early fetal iver shown cross-react anti-L anti-M1 serum, suggesting might L.M2 R.M2 hybrids. hybrid enzymes shown appear early fetal neonatal periods.
