 Carcinogenesis occurs series steps normal benign finally malignant phenotype. cancer evolutionary trajectory accompanied similar metabolic transformation normal metabolism Pasteur and/or Crabtree-Effects Warburg-Effect finally Cannibalism and/or Lactate-Symbiosis. Due lactate production end-product glycolysis, tumor colonies acquire new phenotypes rely lactate energetic fuel. Presence Warburg-Effect indicates tumor cells undergo partial (if complete) de-endosymbiosis cancer cells become unicellular microorganism (anti-Dollo's Law) specially evolve develop cannibalism way metabolism oxidative types cells rely lactate, energetic fuel, might represent extra-endosymbiosis. Thus, end, cancer colony could considered integrated metabolic ecosystem. Proper understanding tumor metabolism contribute discover potential anticancer agents besides conventional chemotherapy.
