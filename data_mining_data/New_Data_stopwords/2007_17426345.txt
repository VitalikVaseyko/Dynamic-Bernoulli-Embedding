 result spectrum mitochondrial defects, tumor cells often preferentially use glycolysis generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), even presence oxygen, phenomenon known aerobic glycolysis, "Warburg effect." Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibitor mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), gatekeeping enzyme entry pyruvate mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. mice, DCA treatment appears reactivate mitochondrial respiration tumor cells, induces selective killing, suppresses cancer growth. observations provide intriguing insights plasticity tumor metabolism may offer new opportunities therapeutic intervention.
