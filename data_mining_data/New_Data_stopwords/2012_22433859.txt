 CD44 multifunctional cell receptor conveys cancer phenotype, regulates macrophage inflammatory gene expression vascular gene activation proatherogenic environments, also marker many cancer stem cells. CD44 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages produce intracytoplasmic domain called CD44-ICD. However, role CD44-ICD cell function unknown. take major step toward elucidation CD44-ICD function using CD44-ICD-specific antibody, modification ChIP assay detect small molecules, extensive computational analysis. show CD44-ICD translocates nucleus, binds novel DNA consensus sequence promoter region MMP-9 gene regulate expression. also show expression many genes contain novel response element promoters up- down-regulated CD44-ICD. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (Hif1alpha)-responsive genes also CD44-ICD consensus sequence respond CD44-ICD induction normoxic conditions therefore independent Hif1alpha expression. Additionally, CD44-ICD early responsive genes encode critical enzymes glycolytic pathway, revealing CD44 could gatekeeper Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) cancer cells possibly cancer stem cells. link CD44 metabolism novel opens new area research previously considered, particularly study obesity cancer. summary, results finally give function CD44-ICD accelerate study regulation many CD44-dependent genes.
