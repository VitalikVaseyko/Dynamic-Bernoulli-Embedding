 isozymes pyruvate kinase (PK) best known rats, characteristics rat isozymes generally used classify PK isozymes species. Given discrepancies generated classification analogy, evaluated classification using phylogeny congruence analysis compositional relatedness vertebrate PK's. phylogenetic analysis confirmed well established separation L R isozymes K isozymes, power became evident identification non-orthologous (or variant) forms PK. analysis emphasized uniqueness chicken liver PK cannot classified either K L isozyme, confirmed tumors express variety forms PK, indicated lungs systematically express PK's orthologous PK's tissues. determination orthology phylogeny congruence analysis assumes structural data different sources subject similar methodological error. However, cannot reject possibility apparent lack orthology due artifacts purification analysis.
