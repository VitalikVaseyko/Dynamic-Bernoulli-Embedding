 sequential changes several glycolytic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycolytic intermediates, adenosine triphosphate, well intracellular pH plasma inorganic phosphorus followed simultaneously eight lambs birth 2 months age. activities glycolytic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase elevated birth. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration increased markedly postnatally associated simultaneous increase concentrations red cell glucose-6-phosphate total triose phosphate decrease intracellular pH. Inorganic phosphorus also increased correlated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration first 10 days postnatal life. content red cell 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP increased slightly. results suggested increased glycolytic flux diphosphoglycerate mutase reaction resulted net synthesis 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. red cell total triose phosphate peaked fell initially, followed glucose-6-phosphate 2,3-diphosphoglycerate suggesting inhibition phosphofructokinase activity decrease glycolysis secondary decreased red cell intracellular pH. 10 days postnatal life glycolytic intermediates fell simultaneously, correlated decrease activity glycolytic enzymes.
