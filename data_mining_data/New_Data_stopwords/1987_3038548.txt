 Upon differential centrifugation cell-free extracts Trypanosoma brucei, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase behaved cytosolic enzymes. two activities could separated chromatography blue Sepharose anion exchangers. 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase Km substrates millimolar range. activity dependent presence inorganic phosphate inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate citrate glycerol 3-phosphate. Km fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 7 microM; enzyme inhibited fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Ki = 10 microM) and, less potently, fructose 6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate glycerol 3-phosphate. Melarsen oxide inhibited 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (Ki less 1 microM) fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (Ki = 2 microM) much potently pyruvate kinase (Ki greater 100 microM). intracellular concentrations fructose 2,6-bisphosphate hexose 6-phosphate highest glucose, intermediate fructose lowest glycerol dihydroxyacetone glycolytic substrates. added glucose, salicylhydroxamic acid caused decrease concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, ATP, hexose 6-phosphate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. studies indicate concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate mainly controlled concentration substrates 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. changes concentration phosphoenolpyruvate agreement stimulatory effect fructose 2,6-bisphosphate pyruvate kinase. micromolar concentrations, melarsen oxide blocked almost completely formation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate induced glucose, without changing intracellular concentrations ATP hexose 6-phosphates. higher concentrations (3-10 microM), drug caused cell lysis, proportional decrease glycolytic flux, well increase phosphoenolypyruvate concentrations restricted extracellular compartment. Similar changes induced digitonin. concluded lytic effect melarsen oxide bloodstream form T. brucei result inhibition pyruvate kinase.
