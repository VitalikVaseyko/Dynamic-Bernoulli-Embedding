 Ever since discovery (1924) Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) remains unresolved puzzle: aggressive cancer cells "prefer" use energetically highly inefficient method burning glucose cellular level? course last 90 years several hypotheses suggested, date clear explanation rather unusual effect. Even though commonly assumed Warburg effect consequence carcinogenesis, yet another hypothesis could brought cellular switch aerobic glycolysis may represent point time normal cell becomes cancerous. Furthermore, switch may happen point fate pyruvic acid determined, caused inadequate supply enzymes promote citric opposed lactic acid cycle. Currently, clinical observations, like low cancer incidence Type 1 diabetes mellitus increased cancer incidence people high carbohydrate diets might called upon support hypothesis.
