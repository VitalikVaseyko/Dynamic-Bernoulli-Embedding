 Acetobacter aceti NCIB 8554 grows minimal medium ethanol glucose carbon energy source. Addition glucose wild type culture ethanol influence growth organism. Growth glucose sensitive mutant A5 inhibited addition glucose glucose disappeared medium. order determine routes glucose metabolised wild type mutant, radiorespirometric, enzymatic, uptake experiments performed. radiorespirometric experiments "continuous substrate feeding" type apparatus constructed. glucose entering cells 30% excreted gluconate 6% metabolised liberation C-1 CO2. rest accumulated intracellularly. differences found wild type mutant. different growth conditions different enzymatic assay methods pyruvate kinase activity (EC 2.7.1.40) could detected. might explain inability A. aceti grow glucose.
