 ATP level, cell motility viability, oxygen uptake, pyruvate kinase activity, ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) induced red-ox Fe(2+)-ascorbate cycling system studied fresh, previously equilibrated glycerol diluent, cryopreserved bull spermatozoa, exposed thermal stress incubation cells 44 degrees C. sharp drop motility viability fresh spermatozoa even so, equilibrated cryopreserved cells accompanied accumulation ATP. cell movement totally inhibited, ATP utilization decreased, chemical energy continued produced cell pyruvate kinase, one key glycolytic enzymes, spermatozoa active (6500 IU/g protein) insensitive feed-back inhibition excess ATP L-cysteine. Accumulation ATP incubation 44 degrees C 0.9% NaCl accompanied rapid decrease oxygen consumption fresh spermatozoa increase Fe(2+)-ascorbate induced UPE, followed sharp decrease ATP level observed end induced UPE measurement. increase photon emission due lipid peroxidation highly correlated increase cell ATP level caused thermal stress.
