 Warburg effect important tumor growth. human M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) key enzyme regulates aerobic glycolysis tumor cells. Recent studies demonstrated PKM2 potential target cancer therapy. present study investigated effects pantoprazole (PPZ) treatment PKM2 transfection human gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 cells vitro. present study revealed PPZ inhibited proliferation tumor cells, induced apoptosis downregulated expression PKM2, contributes current understanding functional association PPZ PKM2. summary, PPZ may suppress tumor growth PKM2 protein inhibitor.
