 Mitochondrial dysfunction hallmark cancer biology. Tumor mitochondrial metabolism characterized abnormal ability function scarce oxygen conditions glycolysis (the Warburg effect), accumulation mitochondrial DNA defects present hereditary neoplasia sporadic cancers. Mitochondrial Lon major regulator mitochondrial metabolism mitochondrial response free radical damage, plays essential role maintenance repair mitochondrial DNA. Despite critical cellular functions Lon, little reported regarding role glioma. Lon expression gliomas relevance patient survival examined using published databases human tissue sections. effect Lon glioma biology investigated siRNA targeting Lon. also tested vitro antitumor activity Lon inhibitor, CC4, glioma cell lines D-54 U-251. High Lon expression associated high glioma tumor grade poor patient survival. Lon expression elevated response variety stimuli, Lon knockdown glioma cell lines decreased cell viability normal conditions, dramatically impaired glioma cell survival hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, Lon inhibitor, CC4, efficiently prohibited glioma cell proliferation synergistically enhanced therapeutic efficacy chemotherapeutic agents, temozolomide (TMZ) cisplatin. demonstrate Lon plays key role glioma cell hypoxic survival mitochondrial respiration, propose Lon promising therapeutic target treatment malignant gliomas.
