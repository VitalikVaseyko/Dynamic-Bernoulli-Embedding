 Hypoxic preconditioning induces tolerance hypoxic-ischemic injury neonatal rat brain associated changes gene expression. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcription factor strongly induced hypoxia hypoxia-mimetic compound cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 modulates expression several target genes including glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), erythropoietin. Recently, HIF-1 expression shown increase hypoxic CoCl(2) preconditioning newborn rat brain. study involvement HIF-1 target genes neonatal hypoxia-induced ischemic tolerance, authors examined brains newborn rats exposure hypoxia (8% O(2) 3 hours) injection CoCl(2) (60 mg/kg). Preconditioning hypoxia CoCl(2) 24 hours hypoxia-ischemia afforded 96% 76% brain protection, respectively, compared littermate control animals. Hypoxic preconditioning increased expression GLUT-1 mRNA protein, aldolase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase proteins mRNA. suggests modulation glucose transport glycolysis hypoxia may contribute development hypoxia-induced tolerance. contrast, preconditioning CoCl(2) produce change HIF-1 target gene expression suggesting different molecular mechanisms may involved induction tolerance hypoxia CoCl(2) newborn brain.
