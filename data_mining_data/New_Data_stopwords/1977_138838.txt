 Juvenile rats fed diet containing 1% lead acetate 7 weeks, addition impaired growth rate renal function derangements, suffered malabsorption glucose certain amino acids, assessed vivo perfusion technique. reduction glucose absorption ranged 10% 31% carbohydrate pumped concentrations 2-80 mM. alteration compatible noncompetitive type transport inhibition. intestinal absorption glycine, lysine, phenylalanine were, respectively, decreased 22, 18, 15% amino acids present 1 mM levels. Sodium transport severely reduced (57.6 +/- 17.9 (SEM) vs. 124.2 +/- 17.4 muEq/min-cm) intestinal mucosa (Na+-K+)-ATPase concomitantly lower lead-intoxicated rats (186.4 +/- 19.0 vs 268.4 +/- 29.8 nmol P/min-mg protein). However, enzyme altered liver kidney. Furthermore, intestinal mucosa fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, succinic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, tryptophan hydroxylase different experimental control animals. studies substantiate presence functional biochemical abnormalities intestinal mucosa young rats fed substantial amounts soluble lead salt. is, therefore, reasonable accept possibility physiologic damage occurs tissues directly subjected high persistent levels toxic agents, occurs organs, underscoring parallelism transport mechanisms renal intestinal levels.
