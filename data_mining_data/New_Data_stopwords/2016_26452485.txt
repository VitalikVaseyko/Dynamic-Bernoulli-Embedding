 aim study investigate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) total blood liver tissue; butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) serum liver tissue; adenosine deaminase (ADA) serum liver tissue; pyruvate kinase (PK) liver tissue rats experimentally infected Fasciola hepatica. Animals divided two groups 12 animals each, follows: group (uninfected) group B (infected). Samples collected 20 (A1 B1;n=6 each) 150 (A2 B2; n=6 each) days post-infection (PI). Infected animals showed increase AChE activity whole blood decrease AChE activity liver homogenates (P<0.05) 20 150 days PI. BChE PK activities decreased (P<0.05) serum liver homogenates infected animals 150 days PI. ADA activity decreased serum 20 150 days PI, liver homogenates decreased 150 days PI (P<0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase activities serum increased (P<0.05), concentrations total protein albumin decreased (P<0.05) compared control. histological analysis revealed fibrous perihepatitis necrosis. Therefore, conclude liver fluke associated cholinergic purinergic dysfunctions, turn may influence pathogenesis disease.
