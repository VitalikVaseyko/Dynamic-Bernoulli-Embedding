 Reprogrammed glucose metabolism result increased glycolysis glucose uptake hallmark cancer. show cancer cells suppress glucose uptake non-tumour cells premetastatic niche, secreting vesicles carry high levels miR-122 microRNA. High miR-122 levels circulation associated metastasis breast cancer patients, show cancer-cell-secreted miR-122 facilitates metastasis increasing nutrient availability premetastatic niche. Mechanistically, cancer-cell-derived miR-122 suppresses glucose uptake niche cells vitro vivo downregulating glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. vivo inhibition miR-122 restores glucose uptake distant organs, including brain lungs, decreases incidence metastasis. results demonstrate that, modifying glucose utilization recipient premetastatic niche cells, cancer-derived extracellular miR-122 able reprogram systemic energy metabolism facilitate disease progression.
