 review describes recent advances made understanding regulation acetylcholine synthesis brain regard availability two precursors, choline acetylCoA. Choline availability appears regulated high affinity choline transport system. Investigations localization inhibition system reviewed. Procedures measuring high affinity choline transport shortcomings described. kinetics effects previous vivo vitro treatments high affinity choline transport reviewed. Kinetic direct coupling transport acetylation choline discussed. Recent investigations source acetylCoA used synthesis acetylcholine reviewed. Three sources acetylCoA recently received support: citrate conversion catalyzed citrate lyase, direct release acetylCoA mitochondria following synthesis pyruvate catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase, production acetylCoA cytoplasmic pyruvate dehydrogenase. Investigations indicating acetylCoA availability may limit acetylcholine synthesis reviewed. model regulation acetylcholine synthesis incorporates reviewed material presented.
