 BACKGROUND: High pretreatment tumor lactate content associated poor outcome fractionated irradiation human squamous cell carcinoma (hSCC) xenografts. Therefore, decreasing lactate content might promising approach increasing tumor radiosensitivity. basis experiments, effects biochemical inhibitors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase dichloroacetate (DCA), lactate dehydrogenase oxamate, monocarboxylic acid transporter-1 alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) tumor micromilieu growth investigated. MATERIALS METHODS: Oxygen consumption (OCR) extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) measured FaDu UT-SCC-5 hSCC response DCA vitro. Mice bearing FaDu, UT-SCC-5, WiDr colorectal adenocarcinoma received either DCA drinking water DCA injected twice day, CHC injected daily. WiDr also treated daily oxamate. FaDu UT-SCC-5 either excised 8 days treatment histology tumor growth monitored. WiDr tumors excised 8 mm. Effect inhibitors ATP, lactate, hypoxia, Ki67 labeling index (LI) evaluated. RESULTS: DCA increased OCR decreased ECAR vitro. None treatments inhibitors significantly changed lactate content, hypoxia levels, Ki67 LI three tumor lines vivo. ATP concentration significantly decreased daily twice injections DCA FaDu accompanied significant increase necrotic fraction. Tumor growth affected treatments. CONCLUSION: Overall, tumor micromilieu tumor growth could changed glycolysis modifiers three tumor cell lines vivo. studies necessary explore impact metabolic targets radiation response.
