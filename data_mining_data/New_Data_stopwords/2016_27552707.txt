 Despite long-known fact facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1 one key players safeguarding increase glucose consumption many tumor entities even conditions normal oxygen supply (known Warburg effect), endeavors undertaken find GLUT1-selective small-molecule inhibitor. transporters GLUT1 family involved crucial processes, transporters addressed inhibitor. high-throughput screen library approximately 3 million compounds performed find small molecule challenging potency selectivity profile. N-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)quinoline-4-carboxamides identified excellent starting point compound optimization. extensive structure-activity relationship explorations, single-digit nanomolar inhibitors selectivity factor >100 GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4 obtained. promising compound, BAY-876 [N(4) -[1-(4-cyanobenzyl)-5-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-7-fluoroquinoli ne-2,4-dicarboxamide], showed good metabolic stability vitro high oral bioavailability vivo.
