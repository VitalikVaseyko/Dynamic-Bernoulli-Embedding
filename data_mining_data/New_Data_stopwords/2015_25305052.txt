 Age main risk factor cancer neurodegeneration; two radically divergent diseases. Yet selective pressure meet cellular metabolic needs may provide common mechanism linking two disorders. exclusive use glycolysis, despite presence oxygen, commonly referred aerobic glycolysis primary metabolic pathway cancer cells. Recent evidence suggests aerobic glycolysis also key regulator synaptic plasticity brain may positively influence cognition. Elevated aerobic glycolysis contributing factor development cancer increased glycolytic flux plays important role biosynthesis macromolecules promotes proliferation. contrast, decreased aerobic glycolysis brain occurs age could lead loss cell survival mechanisms counter pathogenic processes underlying neurodegeneration. review discuss recent findings epidemiological studies demonstrating inverse comorbidity cancer Alzheimer's disease. summarize evidence linking two diseases changes metabolism course normal aging. discuss key steps regulatory mechanisms aerobic glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation could exploited development novel therapies. addition, outline regulation aerobic glycolysis transcriptional level HIF-1alpha Pin1 roles cancer neurodegeneration. Finally, provide possible explanation metabolic dysregulation occurs age, may contributing factor age-related diseases. Determining metabolism becomes dysregulated time could lead development effective interventions ensuring metabolic homeostasis healthy aging.
