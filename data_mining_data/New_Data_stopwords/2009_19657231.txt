 Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxic hematopoietic cells. majority cellular ROS derived mitochondria glucose metabolism, cytokines stimulate process. hypoxia, hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) attenuates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS production induction pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1). Previously, found thrombopoietin (TPO) induces generation mitochondrial ROS. Interestingly, TPO-induced production mitochondrial ROS promotes activation HIF-1. Based findings, speculated TPO-activated HIF-1 functions feedback mechanism block overproduction ROS following TPO stimulation. found TPO induces expression PDK-1 TPO-dependent cell line, UT-7/TPO, HIF-1-dependent manner. Inhibition either HIF-1 PDK-1 resulted increased production ROS following TPO stimulation. observations suggest HIF-1 functions ROS sensor prevent overproduction mitochondrial ROS following cytokine stimulation.
