 new ATP bioluminescence-based method proposed order examine effect toxic shock microbial communities urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). efficiency WWTP must improved, occurrence toxic effect hazardous substances evaluated (Directive 2455/2001/EC). Among bioluminescence assay firefly luciferase commonly used intracellular ATP monitoring. multienzyme systems catalysed three enzymes (adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase firefly luciferase) adenine nucleotides (AN = ATP+ ADP+ AMP) estimation used monitoring metabolic changes activated sludge. method provides better sensitivity ATP quantification alone. pool intracellular extracellular constant growth rate intracellular correlated microbial growth. present investigation, extraction total adenylate assay optimized (chemical mechanical extraction) applied monitoring effect toxic shock (eg. Naphthalene) indigenous biomass activity (intracellular extracellular rates). time, removal naphthalene addressed Laboratory-scale reactors (4 L) inoculated urban activated sludge continuous-flow aeration. reactor, containing non acclimated sludge enriched naphthalene. reactor containing sterilised activated sludge used abiotic volatilisation control system. batch cultures, ATP (intracellular extracellular) rates naphthalene concentrations controlled. One objectives research determine relation ATP/AN ratio biodegradation naphthalene. Evidence given demonstrates ATP/AN parameter possible alternative monitoring rapid metabolic changes complex microbial community activated sludge.
