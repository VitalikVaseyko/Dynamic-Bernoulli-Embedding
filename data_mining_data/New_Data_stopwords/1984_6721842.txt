 Pyruvate kinase activity rates gluconeogenesis glycolysis rat hepatocytes evaluated production glucose lactate + pyruvate dihydroxyacetone feeding cycle progressive starvation. fed rats, daylight (low food intake) darkness, gluconeogenesis progressively increased glycolysis decreased slightly, gluconeogenesis never exceeded glycolysis. nocturnal feeding, gluconeogenesis glycolysis returned morning rates. 8 h starvation, equal proportion dihydroxyacetone converted glucose lactate + pyruvate. glycogen depleted (11 h starvation), gluconeogenesis maximal glycolysis minimal. fed starved rats, concentration fructose 1,6-bisphosphate same. activity ratio pyruvate kinase (ratio velocity 0.5 mM-phosphoenolpyruvate maximum catalytic activity obtained 4mM-phosphoenolpyruvate) high crude extracts cells incubated dihydroxyacetone low (NH4)2SO4-treated extracts, remained unchanged whole experiment. correlation rates gluconeogenesis glycolysis dihydroxyacetone activity ratio pyruvate kinase.
