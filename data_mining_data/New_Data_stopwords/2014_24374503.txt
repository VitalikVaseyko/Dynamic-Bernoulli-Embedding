 Nearly century ago, Otto Warburg made astute observation metabolic properties cancer cells differ markedly normal cells. Several decades passed concept exploiting cancer cell metabolism came clinical practice advent chemotherapy, underlying principle target rapidly dividing cells interfering critical processes all, level, driven cell metabolism. Although chemotherapy quite effective, success rates highly variable adverse effects associated treatment often outweigh benefits due fact chemotherapy indiscriminately cytotoxic rapidly dividing cells, cancerous healthy. past several years, intricate understanding cancer cell metabolism permitted development targeted therapies aim specifically target cancer cells spare healthy tissue exploiting altered metabolism cancer cells. identification new metabolic targets subsequent development small-molecule inhibitors metabolic enzymes demonstrated utility promise targeting cancer cell metabolism anticancer strategy. review summarizes recent advances identification characterization several metabolic enzymes emerging anticancer targets.
