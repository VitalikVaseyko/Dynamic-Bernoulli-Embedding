 RNA metabolism tightly controlled across different tissues developmental stages, dysregulation one molecular hallmarks cancer. direct binding specific sequence element(s), RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play pivotal role co- post-transcriptional RNA regulatory events. recently demonstrated that, pancreatic cancer cells, acquisition drug resistant (DR)-phenotype relied upregulation polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTBP1), turn recruited pyruvate kinase pre-mRNA favors splicing oncogenic PKM2 variant. Herein, describe step-by-step protocol ultraviolet (UV) light cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method determine direct binding RBP specific regions target RNAs adherent human cell lines.
