 31P NMR measurements found convenient means simultaneously measuring concentrations several species equilibrium mixtures reactions catalyzed arginine kinase creatine kinase. MgATP + X equilibrium MgADP + XP X = arginine creatine XP = P-arginine P-creatine. free energy phosphorylaton various metabolites adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) pH 8.0 30 degrees C exergonic corresponding phosphorylations ATP 2.5 kcal/mol, resulting displacement equilibrium toward nucleoside diphosphates factor approximately 60. Since factor depend nature metabolite, equilibrium constants thionucleotide reactions may used determined equilibrium constants corresponding oxynucleotide reactions lie far toward ATP. equilibrium constants oxynucleotide reactions catalyzed pyruvate kinase 3-P-glycerate kinase calculated method experimentally determined equilibrium constants corresponding thionucleotide reactions 3.1 x 10(-4) 2.9 x 10(-4), respectively, experimental conditions used. equilibrium constants degree stereoselectivity arginine kinase reaction altered Ca2+ replaces Mg2+ activating metal ion.
