 describe automated enzymatic procedure quantifying creatine erythrocytes. assay, sample clean-up, creatine kinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.1.7.40) used auxiliary enzymes; lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) used indicator reaction. CK also used starting reagent. Data obtained present method (y) correlated follows comparison method (x) creatine measurement erythrocytes (colorimetric, diacetyl-alpha-naphthol): = 1.017x - 27.5 (S(y/x) = 11.9, r = 0.997). Precision data obtained analyzing three different samples erythrocytes nine times per day 25 days methods. total CVs determined method comparison method respectively 3.0-4.8% (measured creatine range, 171-463 micromol/L) 5.1-7.1% (creatine, 185-485 micromol/L). established reference interval (mean +/- 2SD) creatine erythrocytes healthy individuals 194-538 micromol/L men (n = 71) 241-677 micromol/L women (n = 100). Using erythrocytes patients various hematological abnormalities chronic renal failure, treated continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis hemodialysis, performed clinical evaluation obtained results agreement existing data biochemical markers mean age erythrocytes.
