 BACKGROUND: Surrogate markers bowel inflammation increasingly recognized important, markers disease activity inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) also differentiate irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) IBD. dimeric M2-isoform pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) reported elevated fecal specimens colorectal cancer (CA) patients, role IBD unknown. study investigated usefulness fecal M2-PK cohorts patients IBD, IBS, CA. METHODS: Stool samples obtained calprotectin M2-PK measurements patients previously diagnosed IBD new patients investigated lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms UK university hospital. investigations performed directed investigating physician patients known IBD assessed disease activity physician global assessment, Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), endoscopic grading. RESULTS: Fecal M2-PK calprotectin measurements obtained 148 patients: 50 ulcerative colitis (UC); 31 Crohn's disease (CD), 43 irritable bowel syndrome/functional bowel disorders (IBS); 7 colorectal CA, 17 miscellaneous conditions (excluded analysis). Median M2-PK values (U/mL) significantly elevated UC: 20.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4-69.0, P < 0.0001), CD: 24.3 (95% CI 6.4-44.0, P < 0.0001), CA: 7.0 (95% CI 4.3-88.0, P < 0.0006) compared IBS: 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-3.2). strong linear correlation M2-PK calprotectin levels. predetermined cutoff level 3.7 U/mL normal M2-PK test produced sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) 73%, 74%, 89%, respectively, organic disease. Furthermore, M2-PK levels significantly elevated active, compared inactive, disease CD (30 versus 0.55 U/mL, P < 0.005) UC (40 versus 1.2 U/mL, P = 0.006), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fecal M2-PK elevated IBD well CA patients sensitive relatively specific marker organic GI pathology, PPV 89%. Furthermore, appears potentially valuable, noninvasive marker disease activity IBD.
