 physiological effect chronic exposure altitude hypoxia glycolytic intermediates, adenosine triphosphate 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, hematologic parameters, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, examined indigenous population, Aymara, Departamento de Arica, Chile. population normally resides three altitudes: coast (0-500 m), sierra (2,500-3,500 m), altiplano (above 4,200 m). isolation altitude environmental factors (age, sex, body build, ethnicity, smoking, residential permanence), increase 2,3-diphosphoglycerate decrease adenosine triphosphate observed. hemoglobin hematocrit increased expected, mean cell hemoglobin concentration declined. proposed decline activity single enzyme, pyruvate kinase, account observed changes suggests pivotal role pyruvate kinase physiological adaptation altitude hypoxia.
