 BACKGROUND: much evidence support favorable effects phosphocreatine shuttle myocardial contraction relaxation. However, experiments cardiac muscle fiber myofibril used elucidated precise mechanism. METHODS RESULTS: Active movements fluorescently labeled actin filaments cardiac myosin layer coimmobilized creatinine kinase (CK) onto nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslip studied various concentrations adenine nucleotides. constant phosphocreatine concentration (5 mmol/L, pH 7.1), relation sliding velocity MgATP concentration followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. apparent Km significantly smaller presence CK (0.041 +/- 0.001 mmol/L) absence CK (0.080 +/- 0.001 mmol/L), indicating coattached CK facilitated propelling actin filaments myosin ATPase. phenomenon also seen acidic conditions (pH 6.7) well presence inorganic phosphate (10 mmol/L. constant MgATP concentration (1 mmol/L), inhibitory effect MgADP actin-myosin interaction weaker presence CK absence CK. Another ATP-regenerating system, pyruvate kinase phospho(enol)pyruvate, maintaining low ratio [MgADP] [MgATP], reduce Km value (0.156 +/- 0.001 mmol/L), suggesting effect coattached CK achieved prevention MgADP accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Coupling ATPase cycle CK cycle may serve maintain ATP concentration within myofibril also provide optimal conditions cardiac actomyosin interaction. Consideration coupling offer clue elucidating systolic diastolic dysfunction myocardial ischemia reperfusion.
