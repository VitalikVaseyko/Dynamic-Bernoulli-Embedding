 BACKGROUND: majority colorectal cancer (CRC) cases preventable early detection removal precancerous polyps. Even though CRC second common internal cancer Australia, 30 per cent population considered risk factors participate stool-based test screening programs. Evidence indicates robust, blood-based, diagnostic assay would increase screening compliance. number potential diagnostic blood-based protein biomarkers CRC reported, lack sensitivity specificity use stand-alone diagnostic. aim study identify validate panel protein-based biomarkers independent cohorts could translated reliable, non-invasive blood-based screening test. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: two independent cohorts (n = 145 n = 197), evaluated seven single biomarkers serum CRC patients age/gender matched controls showed significant difference controls CRC, individually lack sensitivity diagnostic application. Using logistic regression strategies, identified panel three biomarkers discriminated controls CRC 73% sensitivity 95% specificity, applied either two cohorts. panel comprised Insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), Pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2). CONCLUSIONS: Due heterogeneous nature CRC, single biomarker unlikely sufficient sensitivity specificity use stand-alone diagnostic screening test panel markers may effective. identified 3 biomarker panel higher sensitivity specificity early stage (Stage -II) disease faecal occult blood test, raising possibility use non-invasive blood diagnostic screening test.
