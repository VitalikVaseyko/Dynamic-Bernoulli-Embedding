 analysis pyruvate kinase distribution developing guinea-pig liver observed substantial proportion activity remained associated microsomal membrane fraction ('microsomes'). Although could removed washing sucrose, majority required detergent treatment liberation, even least one-half remained attached microsomes. Estimates contribution fraction total cell pyruvate kinase activity indicated 50% total, likely underestimate continued latency enzyme even presence detergent. susceptibility microsomal enzyme, whether released detergent sucrose washing, inactivation Triton X-100 suggested different cytosolic enzyme, stable conditions. (The microsomal enzyme required presence additional protein, bovine serum albumin, maintain stability.) view confirmed DEAE-cellulose chromatography particularly isoelectric focusing, microsomal enzyme shown consist least four forms, distinctly different cytosol. data kinetic properties four forms membrane fraction indicate microsomal pyruvate kinase could consist four counterparts cytosolic isoenzyme forms. results discussed relation two possible explanations phenomenon (not mutually exclusive): hydrophobic membrane forms precursors cytosolic enzyme may part functional glycolytic pathway microsomes developing liver.
