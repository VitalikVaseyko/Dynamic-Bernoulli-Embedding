 RATIONALE: majority current cardiovascular cell therapy trials use bone marrow progenitor cells (BM PCs) achieve modest efficacy; limited potential cells differentiate endothelial-lineage cells one major barriers success promising therapy. previously reported E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) repressor revascularization ischemic injury. OBJECTIVE: sought define role E2F1 regulation BM PC function. METHODS RESULTS: Ablation E2F1 (E2F1 deficient) mouse BM PCs increases oxidative metabolism reduces lactate production, resulting enhanced endothelial differentiation. metabolic switch E2F1-deficient BM PCs mediated reduction expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2; overexpression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 reverses enhancement oxidative metabolism endothelial differentiation. Deletion E2F1 BM increases amount PC-derived endothelial cells ischemic myocardium, enhances vascular growth, reduces infarct size, improves cardiac function myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION: results suggest novel mechanism E2F1 mediates metabolic control BM PC differentiation, strategies inhibit E2F1 enhance oxidative metabolism BM PCs may improve effectiveness cell therapy.
