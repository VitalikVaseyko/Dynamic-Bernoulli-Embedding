 PURPOSE: Colorectal disease biomarkers stool actively explored, instability biomolecules faeces constitutes problem. Collection exfoliated cells surface rectal mucosa provides alternative stool-based methods. aimed develop original approach allowing preservation quantification protein biomarkers exfoliated material tested pilot clinical study. METHODS: novel method cell protein preservation ammonium sulphate-rich buffers developed using cultured human cells applied exfoliated cell samples collected 139 faecal occult blood test (FOBT)-positive patients prior colonoscopies. Protein biomarkers comprising calprotectin, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), dimeric pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2PK), soluble cytokeratin-18, d-dimer glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays parallel cytological immunocytochemical analysis. RESULTS: Long-term preservation cells protein constituents ambient temperature achieved using buffers containing saturated ammonium sulphate. Application approach exfoliated cell samples allowed consistent protein quantification. Calprotectin, EDN, M2PK, soluble cytokeratin 18 d-dimer showed dramatic increase cases inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) detected among trial participants. Cytological signs inflammation also present samples. CONCLUSIONS: Application exfoliated cells collected surface rectal mucosa provides reliable method quantifying protein biomarkers gastrointestinal diseases. preliminary results obtained limited number cases indicate approach might especially useful IBD diagnosis monitoring, studies needed assess diagnostic value.
