 INTRODUCTION: Fasting increases myocardial glycogen content shown limit injury improve recovery following no-flow ischaemia isolated heart. However, protective role glycogen loading per se fed animals questioned data preconditioned animals showing reduced glycogenolysis may protective prior no-flow ischemia. Therefore, hypothesized fasting protects globally ischemic heart mechanisms separate glycogen loading. METHODS: Isolated hearts rats fasted 24 h retrogradely perfused using glucose substrate subjected 20 min global no-flow ischemia. Fed rats identically perfused either control conditions (glucose substrate) intervention chosen increase tissue glycogen (glucose plus insulin, [insulin]) prior ischemia. Functional recovery creatine kinase (CK) release measured reperfusion. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy used measure intracellular pH, phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates high-energy phosphates, lactate pyruvate contents hearts measured prior end ischemia. RESULTS: Heart fasted animals significantly increased glycogen content prior ischemia (76.6 +/- 2 vs. 40.9 +/- 3 mumol glu/gdw control hearts, P < 0.05) hearts exposed insulin (88.6 +/- 10 mumol glu/gdw), hearts fasted animals greater glycogen utilization ischemia. Hearts fasted animals also lower levels lactate relative pyruvate (L/P) baseline conditions and, reperfusion, reduced CK release (fasted: 183 +/- 48 versus control: 756 +/- 56 IU/gdw, P < 0.05). Conversely, insulin hearts increased CK release (1831 +/- 190 IU/gdw, P < 0.001 vs control) worse functional metabolic recovery reperfusion. Compared insulin hearts, hearts fasted animals less acidosis less rapid depletion ATP ischemia, well lower accumulation glycolytic intermediates. CONCLUSION: Fasting protects heart ischemic injury associated lower L/P ratio increased glycogen utilization ischemia. contrast, increasing glycogen content hearts fed animals using insulin limits glycogen utilization, increases ischemic injury, impairs functional metabolic recovery conditions 20 min global no-flow ischemia.
