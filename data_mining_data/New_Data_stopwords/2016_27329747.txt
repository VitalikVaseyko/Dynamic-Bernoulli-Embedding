 UNLABELLED: Mice harboring mutation gene encoding gastric intrinsic factor (Gif), protein essential absorption vitamin B12/cobalamin (Cbl), potential model explore role vitamins infection. levels Cbl blood Gif(tm1a/tm1a) mutant mice influenced maternal genotype, offspring born heterozygous (high Cbl, F1) mothers exhibiting significantly higher serum Cbl level born homozygous (low Cbl, F2) equivalents. Low Cbl levels correlated susceptibility infectious challenge Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium Citrobacter rodentium, susceptibility phenotype moderated Cbl administration. Transcriptional metabolic profiling revealed Cbl deficient mice exhibited bioenergetic shift similar metabolic phenomenon commonly found cancerous cells hypoxic conditions known Warburg effect, metabolic effect exacerbated infection. findings demonstrate role Cbl bacterial infection, potential general relevance dietary deficiency infection susceptibility. IMPORTANCE: Malnutrition continues major public health problem countries weak infrastructures. communities high prevalence poor diet, malnourishment infectious disease impact vulnerable individuals pregnant women children. Here, describe highly flexible murine model monitoring maternal environmental influences vitamin B12 metabolism. also demonstrate potential importance vitamin B12 controlling susceptibility bacterial pathogens C. rodentium Typhimurium. postulate model, along similarly vitamin deficient mice, could used explore mechanisms associated micronutrients susceptibility diseases, thereby increasing understanding disease malnourished.
