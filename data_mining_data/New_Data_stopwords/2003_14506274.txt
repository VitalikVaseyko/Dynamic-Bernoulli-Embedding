 Trypanosoma brucei parasitic protist responsible sleeping sickness humans. procyclic form parasite, transmitted tsetse flies, considered dependent oxidative phosphorylation ATP production. Indeed, respiration 55% inhibited oligomycin, specific inhibitor mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase. However, 10-fold excess compound significantly affect intracellular ATP concentration doubling time parasite 1.5-fold increased, suggesting oxidative phosphorylation essential procyclic trypanosomes. investigate sites ATP production, studied role two ATP producing enzymes, involved synthesis pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate: glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PYK). parasite affected PPDK gene knockout. contrast, inhibition PYK expression RNA interference lethal cells. absence PYK activity, intracellular ATP concentration reduced 2.3-fold, whereas intracellular pyruvate concentration reduced. Furthermore, show mutant cell line still excreted acetate d-glucose metabolism, wild type mutant cell lines consumed pyruvate present growth medium similar high rates, indicating absence PYK activity pyruvate still present trypanosomes. conclude PYK essential ATP production, implies cytosolic substrate level phosphorylation essential growth procyclic trypanosomes.
