 Effects phenylephrine, oxytocin angiotensin fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P2) content glycolytic parameters studied incubated thymus lymphocytes. hormones modified Fru 2,6-P2 content dependent upon energetic status cells. non-preincubated thymus lymphocytes (with relatively high levels glycogen ATP), phenylephrine, oxytocin angiotensin depressed Fru 2,6-P2 content dose-dependent manner. opposite found cells preincubated 2 h without substrates (low levels ATP glycogen). Changes lactate release less evident, significant. Phenylephrine modify maximal activities phosphofructokinase (PFK)-1 PFK-2. However, submaximal PFK-1 PFK-2 activities inhibited phenylephrine, response exogenous Fru 2,6-P2 PFK-1 also altered. activities Fru 1,6-P2 pyruvate kinase modified phenylephrine A23187 treatment. Simultaneous presence Cyclosporin (CsA), immunosuppressive drug, antagonizes alpha-adrenergic effect Fru 2,6-P2 content. CsA alone alter basal levels ATP, hexose phosphate Fru 2,6-P2, opposing effect alpha-agonist dose-dependent. CsA cannot change positive action PMA negative action A23187 Fru 2,6-P2 content. present data suggest CsA acts prior calcium liberation protein kinase C activation. Different possible molecular models discussed.
