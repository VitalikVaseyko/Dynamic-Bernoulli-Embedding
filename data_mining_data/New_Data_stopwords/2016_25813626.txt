 Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), rate-limiting enzyme final step glycolysis, known associated metabolic rewiring cancer cells, considered important cancer therapeutic target. Herein, report novel PKM2 activator, PA-12, identified via molecular docking-based virtual screening. demonstrate PA-12 stimulates pyruvate kinase activity recombinant PKM2 vitro, half-maximal activity concentration 4.92 muM, effectively suppresses anchorage-dependent -independent growth lung cancer cells non-essential amino acid-depleted medium. addition, PA-12 blocked nuclear translocalization PKM2 lung cancer cells, resulting inhibition hypoxia response element (HRE)-mediated reporter activity well hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) target gene expression, eventually leading suppression cell viability hypoxia. also verified effects PA-12 dependent PKM2 expression cancer cells, demonstrating specificity PA-12 PKM2 protein. Taken together, data suggest PA-12 novel potent PKM2 activator therapeutic implications lung cancer.
