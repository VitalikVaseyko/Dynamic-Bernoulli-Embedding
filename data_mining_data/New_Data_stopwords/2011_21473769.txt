 BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer commonest type malignant tumors result schistosomaisis major healthy problem many subtropical developing countries. aim study comparatively elucidate underlying biochemical tumor markers schistosomal bladder cancer versus non-schistosomal bladder cancer compared normal healthy ones. METHODS: work performed tissue specimens total 25 patients serum samples total 30 patients versus ten healthy individuals served control. investigated parameters serum are: xanthine oxidase (XO), fructosamine, lactate dehydrogense (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total proteins, essential non- essential amino acids profile, hydroxyproline, total immunoglobulin E (IgE) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). addition, current investigation also extended study markers tumor bladder tissues including, pyruvate kinase enzyme (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) alanine aminotransferase (ALT). RESULTS: Results showed biharzial bladder cancer patients recored significant elevation serum XO, fructosamine, LDH, AST, ALT, hydroxyproline, IgE TNF-alpha bladder cancer patients compared control ones. While, tissues significant increase PK, LDH, AST & ALT activities schistosomal bladder cancer bladder cancer compared control healthy patients. CONCLUSIONS: could concluded that, bilharzial non-bilharzial bladder cancer showed distinct biochemical profile tumor development progression taken consideration diagnosis bladder cancer.
