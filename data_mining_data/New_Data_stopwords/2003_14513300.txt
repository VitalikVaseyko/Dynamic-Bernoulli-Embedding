 M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) specifically expressed tumor cells (TuM2-PK) detected peripheral blood patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC). TuM2-PK useful biological marker localized RCC. analysed TuM2-PK 68 patients metastatic RCC initial surgery prior chemoimmunotherapy metastases. 50 patients, levels TuM2-PK measured chemoimmunotherapy interleukin-2, interferon-alpha2a 5-fluorouracil 8 months correlated response assessed radiological imaging techniques. TuM2-PK quantified commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit using cut 15 kU/l. 48 68 patients (71%), TuM2-PK elevated cut-off. TuM2-PK significantly higher G3 tumors G2 tumors. 34 50 patients (68%) undergoing chemoimmunotherapy, positive correlation TuM2-PK values response treatment observed. Based data, would recommend routine clinical use TuM2-PK metastatic RCC point.
