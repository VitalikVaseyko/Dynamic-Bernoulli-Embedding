 cultivation gene engineered strain Escherichia coli glucose medium, excretion accumulation acetic acid inhibit cell growth also expression heterologous protein. obvious desirable host strain maintaining acetate low level one approaches increase production recombinant protein. present article deals selection mutants E. coli DP19, DP8, grow medium containing pyruvate sole carbon source presence 50 mmol/L fluoroacetic acid. shown mutant DP19 defective phosphotransacetylase(PTA) activity accumulates less acetate medium, DP8 defective acetate kinase (ACK) accumulates similar level acetate comparing parent. Using pta- mutant E. coli DP19 host, expression GL-7ACA acylase gene recombinant plasmid pMR24 improved, yield enzyme activity flask fermentation twice much parent.
