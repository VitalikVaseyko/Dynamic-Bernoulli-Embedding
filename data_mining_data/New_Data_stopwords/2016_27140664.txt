 objective study determine mechanism action short-chain ceramide analog, C6-ceramide, breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, show coactively depress viability induce apoptosis human acute myelogenous leukemia cells. Exposure C6-ceramide-tamoxifen combination elicited decreases mitochondrial membrane potential complex respiration, increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), release mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins. Decreases ATP levels, reduced glycolytic capacity, reduced expression inhibitors apoptosis proteins also resulted. Cytotoxicity drug combination mitigated exposure antioxidant. Cells metabolized C6-ceramide glycosylation hydrolysis, latter leading increases long-chain ceramides. Tamoxifen potently blocked glycosylation C6-ceramide long-chain ceramides. N-desmethyltamoxifen, poor antiestrogen major tamoxifen metabolite humans, also effective C6-ceramide, indicating traditional antiestrogen pathways involved cellular responses. conclude cell death driven mitochondrial targeting ROS generation tamoxifen enhances ceramide effect blocking metabolism. depletion ATP targeting "Warburg effect" represent dynamic metabolic insult, ceramide-containing combination may utility treatment leukemia cancers.
