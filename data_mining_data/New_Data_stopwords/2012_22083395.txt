 productivity epsilon-poly-L: -lysine (epsilon-PL) currently reported wild-type strains low. improved glucose tolerance Streptomyces graminearus strain LS-B1 genome shuffling simultaneously enhancing epsilon-PL productivity. starting population generated ultraviolet irradiation nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis subjected recursive protoplast fusion. positive colonies library, created fusing inactivated protoplasts screened agar plates containing different concentrations glucose. Characterization recombinants wild-type strain shake-flask fermentation indicated compatibility two phenotypes glucose tolerance epsilon-PL yield enhancement. best performing recombinant, F3-4, isolated three rounds genome shuffling, whose epsilon-PL production 88% higher parent strain. batch fermentation test, epsilon-PL concentration obtained 2.4 g/L F3-4 compared 1.6 g/L wild type. Fed-batch fermentation F3-4 carried epsilon-PL production accumulated 13.5 g/L initial glucose concentration improved 50 85 g/L. Enzyme activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase revealed glycolytic pathway tricarboxylic acid circle way F3-4 active wild type, possible reason enhanced epsilon-PL production.
