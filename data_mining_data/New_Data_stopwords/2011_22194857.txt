 tumors outgrow blood supply become oxygen deprived, switch less energetically efficient oxygen-independent anaerobic glucose metabolism. However, cancer cells maintain glycolytic phenotype even areas ample oxygen supply (Warburg effect). hypothesized competitive advantage glycolytic cells get aerobic cells achieved secretion lactic acid, by-product glycolysis. creates acidic microenvironment around tumor toxic normal somatic cells. interaction seen prisoner's dilemma: point view metabolic payoffs, better cells cooperate become better competitors neither cell incentive unilaterally change metabolic strategy. paper novel mathematical technique, allows reducing otherwise infinitely dimensional system low dimensionality, used demonstrate changing environment take cells equilibrium cooperation fact lead cell population committing evolutionary suicide.
