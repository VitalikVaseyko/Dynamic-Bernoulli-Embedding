 2'-Deoxy-lin-benzoadenosine synthesized via reductive deoxygenation 2-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-8-(methylthio)imidazo[4,5-g]quinazoline. 5'-mono-, 5'-di-, 5'-triphosphates prepared chemical and/or enzymatic methods. 5'-diphosphate found substrate phosphorylation pyruvate kinase compared various natural extended substrates kinetic assays. 2'-deoxy-lin-benzoadenosine 5'-triphosphate tested nick-translation experiment Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, low level 32P incorporation [alpha-32P]TTP poly[d(AT)] observed. Nearest-neighbor analysis indicated analogue significantly incorporated internal positions polymer. DNA-sequencing reactions, analogue caused chain termination adensine residues, although termination less uniform less efficient 2',3'-dideoxy-ATP. experiments show lin-benzoadenine form widened Watson-Crick base pair thymine. strongly suggest, though prove, enzyme able attach analogue DNA.
