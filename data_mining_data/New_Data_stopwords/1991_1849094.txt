 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) previously shown stimulate gluconeogenesis rat liver decreasing activity pyruvate kinase [(1988) Biochem. J. 255, 361-364]. investigate mechanism underlying inactivation enzyme. EGF found increase incorporation phosphate pyruvate kinase, maximal phosphorylation achieved 10 min presence growth factor. increase phosphorylation additive caused cyclic AMP. Phosphoamino acid analysis pyruvate kinase isolated cells treated EGF indicated EGF increases phosphorylation solely serine residues. exact site EGF-mediated phosphorylation yet identified.
