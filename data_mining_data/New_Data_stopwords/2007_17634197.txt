 Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays important role regulating gene expression response ischemia. Although activation HIF-1 muscle tissue found ischemia vivo, meaning mechanisms isolated cells still incompletely understood. studied activation HIF-1 skeletal muscle cells cultured either undifferentiated myoblast state differentiated myotubes. HIF-1 activated myoblasts myotubes hypoxia simulated ischemia. Induction adrenomedullin mRNA and, lesser extent, VEGF mRNA correlated well induction HIF-1alpha protein cell types. Enzymes glycolysis-like lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase showed upregulation mRNA hypoxic conditions simulated ischemia. Phosphofructokinase mRNA showed significant upregulation all. Although HIF-1 activated myotubes simulated ischemia, myotubes died preceded loss ATP. Myoblasts survived simulated ischemia decrease ATP ATP turnover. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition HIF-1 hydroxylases dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) increased HIF-1alpha accumulation significantly upregulated expression adrenomedullin, VEGF, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase myoblasts myotubes. However, DMOG provided protection cell death. data indicate HIF-1, although activated myotubes simulated ischemia, cannot protect loss ATP cell viability. contrast, myoblasts survive ischemia thus may play important role regeneration HIF-1-induced revascularization.
