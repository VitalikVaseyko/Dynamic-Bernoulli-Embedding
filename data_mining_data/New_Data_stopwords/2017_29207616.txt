 Cancer metabolism emerged increasingly attractive target interfering tumor growth. Small molecule activators pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2) suppress tumor formation unknown effect established tumors. demonstrate TEPP-46, PKM2 activator, results increased glucose consumption, providing rationale combining PKM2 activators toxic glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Combination treatment resulted reduced viability range cell lines standard cell culture conditions concentrations drugs effect used alone. effect replicated vivo established subcutaneous tumors. demonstrated ability detect acute metabolic differences combination treatment using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Combination treated tumors displayed higher pyruvate lactate (13)C-label exchange 2 hr post-treatment. ability assess effect drugs non-invasively may accelerate implementation clinical translation drugs target cancer metabolism.
