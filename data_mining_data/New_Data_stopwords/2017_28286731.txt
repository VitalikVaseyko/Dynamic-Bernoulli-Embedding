 Pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) important glycolytic enzyme involved multiple physiological developmental processes. study, demonstrated cotton cytosolic pyruvate kinase 6 (GhPK6) phosphorylated serines 215 402. Phosphorylation GhPK6 serine 215 inhibited enzyme activity, whereas phosphorylation serine sites could promote degradation. phosphorylation-mediated ubiquitination GhPK6 gradually attenuated cotton fiber elongation process, sufficiently explained increase protein/mRNA ratios. results collectively provided experimental evidence cotton fiber elongation might regulated post-translational level.
