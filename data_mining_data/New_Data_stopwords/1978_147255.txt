 study post-mortem changes human central nervous tissue shown within 100 h death, significant change occurs amount nerve cell DNA nucleolar RNA membrane-associated enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, NADH NADPH diaphorase, cytochrome oxidase. Low molecular weight RNA species, probably transfer messenger RNA quickly lost, little alteration ribosomal RNA content. Cytoplasmic enzymes show variable changes; phosphofructokinase activity rapidly decreased; hexokinase unaltered lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase initially show increases activity subsequently decline. Oxygen uptake diminishes quickly. findings indicate mechanical alterations cell structure, following death, render organelles physiologically ineffective long significant changes certain constituent biochemicals detected. report emphasizes great importance necessary selection appropriately time matched post-mortem tissues accurate comparative studies many cells constituents made.
