 Microorganisms developed three different systems catalyzing protein phosphorylation using reversible modificaiton regulate cellular activities. first 'classical' system utilizes nucleoside-triphosphates phosphoryl donors leads modification protein substrates serine/threonine tyrosine residues. second system, called 'two-component system', requires first sensor kinase autophosphorylates histidine residue expense adenosine-triphosphate, response regulator modified turn aspartate residue thereafter induces metabolic change within cell. third system, called 'PTS system', makes use phosphoenol pyruvate generate phosphoryl group passed chain several proteins finally transferred sugar. increasing evidence that, contrary early concept, systems corresponding enzymes (protein kinases phosphoprotein phosphatases) share number structural functional similarities phosphorylation-dephosphorylation machineries found eukaryotes. Therefore one expect microorganisms serve, again, basic model exploring understanding key regulatory mechanism, reversible protein phosphorylation, concerns organisms.
