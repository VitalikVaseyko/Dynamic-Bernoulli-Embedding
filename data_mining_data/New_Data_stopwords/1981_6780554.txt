 paper concerned control glycolysis nongrowing Streptococcus lactis 7962. Changes measured concentrations glycolytic intermediates, intracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi), adenine nucleotides following addition glucose cells starved condition. find intracellular Pi major factor control glycolysis. starved cells, intracellular Pi concentration high, greater 40 mM. large phosphoenolpyruvate pool exists starved cells explained result inhibition pyruvate kinase high concentration Pi. hand, cells metabolizing glucose steady state rate, cellular Pi concentration low pyruvate kinase active. Upon depletion glucose medium, metabolite concentrations return values originally found starved state. glucose depletion raises intracellular Pi leads inhibition pyruvate kinase consequent buildup P-enolpyruvate pool.
