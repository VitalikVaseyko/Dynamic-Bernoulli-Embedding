 method described determining triacylglyceride concentration small amounts plasma. ethanolic-KOH digestion diluted plasma aliquots, samples neutralized MgSO4 glycerol fluorimetrically assayed supernatants coupling glycerokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase catalyzed reactions. Values corrected free glycerol present non-digested samples. Digestions performed different times temperatures order establish optimum conditions recoveries reproducibility. Parallel determinations phospholipid removal showed presence plasma interfere obtained values. method especially useful running many samples parallel determinations small experimental animals amount plasma limited.
