 PURPOSE: study evaluates effect low oxygen conditions (5 Vs 20%) buffalo embryo development. Expression patterns key glucose metabolism genes (HK, PFK, LDH, PDH, G6PDH Glut1) assessed buffalo oocytes embryos cultured 5 20% oxygen correlated development rate. METHODS: Maturation rate observed determining MII stages Aceto-orcein method blastocyst formation observed 7 day post insemination (dpi). Expression levels genes determined real time PCR oocytes / embryos 5 20% O2. RESULTS: Oocyte maturation blastocyst formation rates significantly higher 5% O2 compared 20% O2 (P < 0.05). expression pattern glycolytic genes (HK, PFK G6PDH) indicated oocytes embryos 5% O2 tend follow anaerobic glycolysis pentose phosphate pathways support optimum embryo development. 20% O2, oocytes embryos high expression PDH indicating higher oxidative phosphorylation. Further, less G6PDH expression 20% O2 indicative lower pentose phosphate activity. Higher expression LDH observed oocytes embryos 20% O2 indicating sub-optimal culture conditions. High Glut1 activity observed oocytes / embryos 5% O2, indicative high glucose uptake correlating high expression glycolytic genes. CONCLUSION: expression patterns glucose metabolism genes could valuable indicator development potential oocytes embryos. study indicates importance reduced oxygen conditions production good quality embryos.
