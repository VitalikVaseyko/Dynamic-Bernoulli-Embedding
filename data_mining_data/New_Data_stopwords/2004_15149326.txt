 BACKGROUND: renal hypertrophy occurs diabetes mellitus, decreased proteolysis may lead protein accumulation, unclear proteins affected. lysosomal proteolytic pathway chaperone-mediated autophagy suppressed growth factors cultured cells, investigated whether abundance substrates pathway increase diabetic hypertrophy. METHODS: Rats streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes pair-fed vehicle-injected control rats. Proteolysis measured lysine release renal cortical suspensions protein synthesis phenylalanine incorporation. Target proteins chaperone-mediated autophagy measured cortical lysates nuclear extracts immunoblot analysis. Proteins regulate chaperone-mediated autophagy [the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a (LAMP2a) heat shock cognate protein 73 kD (hsc-73)] measured lysosomes isolated density gradient centrifugation. RESULTS: Proteolysis decreased 41% diabetic rats; protein synthesis increased 3 days, returned baseline 7 days. abundance proteins containing chaperone-mediated autophagy KFERQ signal motif increased 38% individual KFERQ containing proteins [e.g., M2 pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pax2] abundant. LAMP2a hsc73 decreased 25% 81%, respectively, cortical lysosomes diabetic vs. control rats. CONCLUSION: decline proteolysis acute diabetes mellitus associated increase proteins degraded chaperone-mediated autophagy decrease proteins regulate pathway. study provides first evidence reduced chaperone-mediated autophagy contributes accumulation specific proteins diabetic-induced renal hypertrophy.
