 role ammonium ion AMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.6) reaction activation phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) decrease adenylate energy charge investigated using permeabilized yeast cells. Response AMP deaminase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase variation energy charge typical ATP-regenerating enzymes: activation decrease energy charge situ conditions. addition polyamine activated AMP deaminase situ, resulting subsequent increase ammonium production, stimulate phosphofructokinase activity increase optimal energy charge value giving maximal activity enzyme. optimal energy charge value phosphofructokinase 0.2-0.25 absence ammonium ion shifted value 0.5 addition ammonium ion, whereas Pi, activator enzyme showed little effect increase optimal energy charge value. optimal energy charge value AMP deaminase pyruvate kinase affected addition effectors. Modulation response energy charge phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase analyzed terms "activation coefficient," defined ratio activity energy charge 0.6 value 0.9. Activation phosphofructokinase physiological decrease energy charge (0.9 0.6) enhanced increase ammonium ion specifically, although coefficient pyruvate kinase remained unaffected ammonium ion. results suggest AMP deaminase reaction ammonium-forming reaction participate key role stimulation phosphofructokinase glycolytic flux cells.
