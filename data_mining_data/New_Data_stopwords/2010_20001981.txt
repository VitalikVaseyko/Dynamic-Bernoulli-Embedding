 examine whether nutritional supplementation SkQ1 reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury vivo, Wistar rats fed regular diet supplemented different doses SkQ1 two three weeks. Control groups rats fed diet supplemented NaBr. Anaesthetized rats subjected 40-min regional myocardial ischemia 1-h reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size measured 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method. SkQ1-fed rats (125 nmol/kg/day two weeks 250 nmol/kg/day two three weeks) revealed significantly smaller myocardial infarction less lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) activity elevations plasma end reperfusion compared controls. effect combined improvement energy state area risk end reperfusion, namely, augmentation adenine nucleotide content, two-fold increase phosphocreatine, reduction lactate accumulation decrease lactate/pyruvate ratio myocardial tissue. Therefore, nutritional supplementation SkQ1 renders hearts resistant ischemia-reperfusion injury affecting oxidative metabolism postischemic cardiomyocytes.
