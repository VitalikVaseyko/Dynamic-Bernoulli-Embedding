 Increased accumulation and/or impaired utilization fatty acid extra-adipose tissues implicated pathogenesis insulin resistance type 2 diabetes. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4) key enzyme involved fatty oxidation energy expenditure, expression repressed pro-inflammatory stimuli. Previously, shown class II transactivator (CIITA) mediates adverse effect interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) skeletal muscle cells cooperating hypermethylated cancer 1 (HIC1) repress silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) transcription. Building upon finding, report CIITA interacted HIC1 via GTP-binding domain (GBD) HIC1 interacted CIITA via BTB/POZ domain. GBD domain required CIITA repress SIRT1 transcription probably acting bridge CIITA bind HIC1 consequently bind SIRT1 promoter. IFN-gamma stimulation, CIITA over-expression, HIC1 over-expression repressed Pdk4 promoter activity silencing either CIITA HIC1 normalized Pdk4 expression presence IFN-gamma. increase SIRT1 expression activity partially rescued Pdk4 expression presence CIITA, SIRT1 inhibition abrogated Pdk4 normalization even absence CIITA. Taken together, data identified HIC1-CIITA-SIRT1 axis regulates Pdk4 transcription response IFN-gamma stimulation.
