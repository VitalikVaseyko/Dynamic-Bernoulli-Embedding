 Triterpenoid saponin derivatives oleanolic acid (OA) ursolic acid (UA), betulinic acid (BA), previously found strong antimicrobial activity Streptococcus mutans. OA UA inhibited transcription genes related peptidoglycan biosynthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth. However, clear whether pathway involved antimicrobial activity compounds S. mutans. Therefore, used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) microarray analyses examine expression genes related essential metabolic pathways S. mutans UA159 following incubation OA, UA, BA. oligonucleotide array consisting 5363 probes designed survey 1928 1963 genes genome S. mutans UA159. Genes showed >2-fold changes expression response treatment conditions annotated, selected target genes involved central metabolism analyzed qPCR. Microarray analysis confirmed gene expression patterns OA- UA-treated cells differed BA-treated culture, indicating differences antimicrobial mechanism. particular, expression pfk pykF, coding glycolysis regulatory proteins phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase, respectively, significantly decreased OA UA groups (P < 0.05), genes involved fatty acid amino acid synthesis. addition, microarray analysis confirmed previous qPCR results showing peptidoglycan synthesis down-regulated OA- UA-treated groups. OA UA also appear decrease generation organic acids S. mutans UA159, would anticaries effect. Overall, findings suggest OA UA affect multiple genes involved central metabolism S. mutans, inhibition glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, peptidoglycan synthesis, contributing antimicrobial activity.
