 Pyruvate kinase requires K+ maximal activity; enzyme exhibits 0.02% maximal activity absence [Kayne, F. J. (1971) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 143, 232-239]. However, pyruvate kinase entrapped reverse micelles exhibits important K+-independent activity [Ramirez-Silva, L., Tuena de Gomez-Puyou, M., & Gomez-Puyou, A. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 5332-5338]. possible amount water, well interactions protein micelles, account behavior. therefore explored solvent effects catalytic properties muscle pyruvate kinase. enzyme exhibited activity 19.4 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) 40% dimethylsulfoxide, compared 280 0.023 micromol x min(1) x mg(-1) observed without K+ water, respectively. pH activity profiles kinetic constants substrates pyruvate kinase dimethylsulfoxide without K+ similar 100% water K+, differed water without K+. spectral center mass emission spectrum pyruvate kinase 100% water exhibited blue shift 3.5 nm presence Mg(2+), phosphenolpyruvate, K+, ligands induce active conformation enzyme. spectral center mass apoenzyme 30-40% dimethylsulfoxide coincided enzyme-Mg(2+)-phosphenolpyruvate-K+ complex 100% water. water relaxation rate enhancement factor binding phosphenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase-Mn(2+)-(CH3)4N+ complex 30-40% dimethylsulfoxide similar pyruvate kinase-Mn(2+)-K+ complex water. aforementioned results indicate muscle pyruvate kinase without K+, 30-40% dimethylsulfoxide induces active conformation.
