 Isothermal calorimetry used examine effect thermodynamic non-ideality kinetics catalysis rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase result molecular crowding inert cosolutes. investigation, designed detect substrate-mediated isomerization pyruvate kinase, revealed 15% enhancement maximal velocity supplementation reaction mixtures 0.1 proline, glycine sorbitol. effect thermodynamic non-ideality implicates existence substrate-induced conformational change governed minor volume decrease small isomerization constant; hence, substantiates earlier inferences rate-determining step pyruvate kinase kinetics isomerization ternary enzyme product complex rather release products.
