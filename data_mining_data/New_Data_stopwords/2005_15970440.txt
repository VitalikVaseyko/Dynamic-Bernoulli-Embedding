 isoflavones--genistein daidzein -- compounds found high concentrations soy play important role prevention many diseases affect metabolic pathways. performed experiment demonstrated genistein (5mg/kg b.w.) administered intragastrically three days male Wistar rats substantially diminished blood leptin level. Studies isolated rat adipocytes revealed phytoestrogen strongly restricted leptin secretion cells. effects accompanied changes leptin gene expression adipocytes. Daidzein-- analogue genistein -- used similar concentrations affect blood leptin concentration, leptin secretion expression gene. determine influence genistein daidzein leptin release, adipocytes isolated epididymal fat tissue incubated 2h Krebs--Ringer buffer. Leptin secretion stimulated glucose insulin significantly diminished genistein (0.25--1mM). effect genistein may arise several aspects action adipocytes documented literature inhibition glucose transport metabolism, attenuation insulin signalling, inhibition cAMP phosphodiesterase stimulation lipolysis. However, bypassing restrictive action genistein glucose transport glycolysis (by use alanine instead glucose) insulin action (by use nicotinic acid) sufficient restore leptin secretion isolated adipocytes. also demonstrated restriction stimulatory influence genistein cAMP/protein kinase (PKA) pathway (by inhibition PKA activity) improve leptin release. Results obtained experiments point restriction glucose metabolism following formation pyruvate pivotal reason inhibitory action genistein leptin release.
