 mechanisms control mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity include phosphorylation (inactivation) family pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs 1 - 4). review new developments regulation activities expression PDKs, particular PDK2 PDK4, relation glucose lipid homeostasis. review describes recent advances relating acute long-term modes regulation PDKs, particular emphasis regulatory roles nuclear receptors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha Liver X receptor (LXR), PPAR gamma coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha) insulin, impact changes PDK activity expression glucose lipid homeostasis. Since PDK4 may assist lipid clearance imbalance lipid delivery oxidation, may represent attractive target interventions aimed rectifying abnormal lipid well glucose homeostasis disease states.
