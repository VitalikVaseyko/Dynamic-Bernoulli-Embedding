 Glycogen, adenosine triphosphate, hydration measured rabbit corneal epithelium determine whether corneal epithelium glycogen decrease, increase epithelial hydration, decrease epithelial adenosine triphosphate stores, seen result contact lens wear, secondary anoxia may also resulted mild trauma, interference oxygenation. Conventional contact lens wear, trauma, oxygen-permeable contact lens wear caused metabolic changes, showing trauma well anoxia may play important role corneal epithelial response contact lens wear.
