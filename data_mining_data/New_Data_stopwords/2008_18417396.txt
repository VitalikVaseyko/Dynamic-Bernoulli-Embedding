 catabolic energy metabolism capacities spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) embryogenesis investigated. assessed embryo's ability catabolize proteins (trypsin-like proteases) lipids (triglyceride lipase) examined development metabolic capacities using enzymatic assays: ability use carbohydrates (pyruvate kinase), amino acids (aspartate aminotransferase) fatty acids (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) energy production, aerobic (citrate synthase) anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) energy production. Functional enzymatic systems detected eyed stage (350 degree-days), except fatty acids, detected 540 degree-days. compare development 1) aerobic anaerobic pathways 2) capacity mobilize different energy substrates, enzymatic ratios calculated. Anaerobic capacity appeared increase significantly higher rate aerobic capacity. Ratios revealing relative capacity use specific energy substrates showed significantly slower increase development capacity use carbohydrates amino acids fatty acids. end embryogenesis characterized significant decrease use carbohydrates aerobic energy production increasing capacity use amino acids. Egg survival affected variability metabolic parameters discussed.
