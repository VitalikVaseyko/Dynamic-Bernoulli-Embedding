 Although aluminum (Al) known toxic, exact molecular events enable trivalent metal involved various diseases fully delineated. report, show Al promotes translocation HIF-1alpha (hypoxia inducible factor) nucleus activates anaerobic metabolism D-glucose. Al-exposed hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) showed marked increase HIF-1alpha associated nuclear extracts. D-Glucose consumption Al-stressed cells rapid GLUT-1 transporter expressed. Furthermore, Al-treated HepG2 cells characterized enhanced activities metabolic enzymes hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). (13)C- NMR studies pointed metabolic profile Al-stressed cells favored enhanced glycolysis. HPLC analyses confirmed increased glycolytic ATP production Al-exposed hepatocytes. findings reveal ability Al create hypoxic environment promotes translocation HIF-1alpha nucleus stimulates anaerobic metabolism D-glucose.
