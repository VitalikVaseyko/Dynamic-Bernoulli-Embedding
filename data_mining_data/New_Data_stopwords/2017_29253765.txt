 study aims investigate utilization Warburg Effect, cancer's "sweet tooth" natural greed glucose enhance effect monocarboxylate transporter inhibition cellular acidification. simulating hyperglycemia high glucose may increase effectiveness inhibition lactate proton export dysregulation cell pH homeostasis causing cell death disruption growth cancer cells. MCT1 MCT4 expression determined MCF7 K562 cell lines using RT-PCR. Cell viability, growth, intracellular pH cell cycle analysis measured cell lines grown 5mM 25mM glucose containing media presence absence MCT1 inhibitor AR-C155858 (1muM) NHE1 inhibitor cariporide (10muM). MCT1 inhibitor, AR-C155858 minimal effect viability, growth intracellular pH MCT4 expressing MCF7 cells. AR-C155858 effect viability MCT1 expressing K562 cells, decreased intracellular pH cell proliferation, glucose-dependent mechanism. Inhibition NHE1 effect cell growth, together AR-C155858 showed additive effect inhibition cell growth. cancer cells express MCT1, increased glucose concentrations presence MCT1 inhibitor decreased intracellular pH reduced cell growth G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Thus propose transient hyperglycemic-clamp combination proton export inhibitors evaluated adjunct cancer treatment clinical studies.
