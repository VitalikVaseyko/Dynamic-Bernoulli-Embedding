 spectrophotometric method quantification linear DNA described. assay measures ADP produced following digestion linear DNA ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease. Cleavage phosphodiester bond DNA substrate proportional ADP formed reaction follows typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) 0.6 microM, V(max) 30 nmol/min/mg). enzyme requires Mg(2+)-ATP Mg(2+)-DNA substrates, although results suggest requirement yet another metal ion may enzyme bound. single-stranded double-stranded linear DNA substrates, demonstrated comparable initial velocity measurements. However, covalently closed circular (CCC) nicked open circular DNA substrates enzyme. rate hydrolysis ATP inhibited 1 microg RNA covalently closed circular DNA. product (ADP) formed reaction coupled NADH oxidation using pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. NAD formed reaction monitored spectrophotometrically loss absorbance 340 nm. assay directly measures amount linear DNA present preparations supercoiled (CCC) plasmid DNA, direct utility monitoring quality plasmid preparations gene therapy.
