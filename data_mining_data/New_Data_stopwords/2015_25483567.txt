 Lung cancer second common type cancer world common cause cancer-related death men women. Research causes, prevention treatment lung cancer ongoing much progress made recently areas, however survival rates significantly improved. Therefore, essential develop biomarkers early diagnosis lung cancer, prediction metastasis evaluation treatment efficiency, well using molecules provide understanding tumour biology translate highly promising findings basic science research clinical application. investigation, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry initially used analyse conditioned media panel lung cancer normal bronchial epithelial cell lines. Significant proteins identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), Hsc-70 interacting protein lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) selected analysis serum healthy individuals lung cancer patients. hnRNPA2B1, PKM2 LDHA found statistically significant comparisons. Tissue analysis knockdown hnRNPA2B1 using siRNA subsequently demonstrated overexpression potential role molecule lung tumorigenesis. data presented highlights number vitro derived candidate biomarkers subsequently verified patient samples also provides insight roles complex intracellular mechanisms associated tumour progression.
