 Oxidative metabolism glucose regulated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibited isoforms PDH kinase (PDK). Recently, increased PDK activity implicated pathogenesis insulin resistance non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) obese subjects. Using quantitative RT-PCR, measured mRNA PDK2 PDK4 isoforms skeletal muscle biopsies nondiabetic Pima Indians, population high prevalence NIDDM associated obesity. PDK2 PDK4 mRNAs positively correlated fasting plasma insulin concentration, 2-h plasma insulin concentration response oral glucose, percentage body fat, whereas isoforms negatively correlated insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates. Measurements PDK2 PDK4 mRNA hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp PDK2 cell culture indicated transcripts decrease response insulin. Increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation traditionally viewed cause increased PDK activity contributing insulin resistance obese subjects. contrast, data indicate insufficient downregulation PDK mRNA insulin-resistant individuals could cause increased PDK expression leading impaired glucose oxidation followed increased FA oxidation.
