 BACKGROUND: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) important enzymes glycolysis. phosphorylated therefore regulated Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). phosphorylation LDHA tyrosine10 leads tetramerization activation, phosphorylation PKM2 tyrosine105 promotes dimerization inactivation. Dimeric PKM2 found nucleus regulates gene transcription. Up-regulation phosphorylation LDHA PKM2 contribute faster proliferation hypoxic conditions promote Warburg effect. METHODS: Using western blot SYBR Green Real time PCR investigated 77 thyroid tissues including 19 goiter tissues, 11 follicular adenomas, 16 follicular carcinomas, 15 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 16 undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas total expression PKM2, LDHA FGFR1. Additionally, phosphorylation status PKM2 LDHA analysed. Inhibition FGFR performed FTC133 cells SU-5402 Dovitinib. RESULTS: examined thyroid cancer subtypes overexpressed PKM2 compared goiter. LDHA overexpressed follicular papillary thyroid cancer compared goiter. Elevated phosphorylation LDHA PKM2 detectable analysed cancer subtypes. highest relative phosphorylation levels PKM2 LDHA compared overall expression found undifferentiated thyroid cancer. Inhibition FGFR led significantly decreased phosphorylation levels PKM2 LDHA. CONCLUSIONS: data shows overexpression increased phosphorylation PKM2 LHDA common finding thyroid malignancies. Phospho-PKM2 Phospho-LDHA could valuable tumour markers thyroglobulin negative thyroid cancer.
