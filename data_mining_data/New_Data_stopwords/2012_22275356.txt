 Cancer cells universally increase glucose glutamine consumption, leading altered metabolic state known Warburg effect; one metabolic pathway, highly dependent glucose glutamine, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Increased flux hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads increases post-translational addition O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) various nuclear cytosolic proteins. number target proteins implicated cancer, recently, O-GlcNAcylation shown play role breast cancer; however, O-GlcNAcylation cancers remains poorly defined. Here, show O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) overexpressed prostate cancer compared normal prostate epithelium OGT protein O-GlcNAc levels elevated prostate carcinoma cell lines. Reducing O-GlcNAcylation PC3-ML cells associated reduced expression matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, VEGF, resulting inhibition invasion angiogenesis. OGT-mediated regulation invasion angiogenesis dependent upon regulation oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1, key regulator invasion angiogenesis, reducing OGT expression led increased FoxM1 protein degradation. Conversely, overexpression degradation-resistant FoxM1 mutant abrogated OGT RNAi-mediated effects invasion, MMP levels, angiogenesis, VEGF expression. Using mouse model metastasis, found reduction OGT expression blocked bone metastasis. Altogether, data suggest prostate cancer cells alter glucose glutamine levels, O-GlcNAc modifications OGT levels become elevated required regulation malignant properties, implicating OGT novel therapeutic target treatment cancer.
