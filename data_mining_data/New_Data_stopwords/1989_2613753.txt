 subunit Xenopus nucleoplasmin polypeptide possesses single nuclear location sequence, boundaries determined deletion analysis. However, sequence identified analysis unable locate pyruvate kinase cell nucleus. investigation revealed sequence element sufficient nuclear localisation, necessary feature slightly longer sequences locate pyruvate kinase cell nucleus. unusual feature nucleoplasmin sequence suggests testable models interaction sequence transport mechanism, one discussed here.
