 Tumor cells rely aerobic glycolysis generate ATP, namely "Warburg" effect. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) well characterized glycolytic inhibitor, effect cellular signaling pathways fully elucidated. Herein, sought investigate effect 2-DG ERK function lung cancer cells. found 2-DG inhibits ERK phosphorylation time dose-dependent manner lung cancer cells. inhibition requires functional LKB1. LKB1 knockdown LKB1 wildtype cells correlated increase basal level p-ERK. Restoration LKB1 LKB1-null cells significantly inhibits ERK activation. Blocking AMPK function AMPK inhibitor, AMPK siRNA DN-AMPK diminishes inhibitory effect 2-DG ERK, suggesting 2-DG-induced ERK inhibition mediated LKB1/AMPK signaling. Moreover, IGF1-induced ERK phosphorylation significantly decreased 2-DG. Conversely, subset oncogenic mutants K-Ras, main upstream regulator ERK, blocks 2-DG-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling. findings reveal potential cross-talk LKB1/AMPK ERK signaling help better understand mechanism action 2-DG.
