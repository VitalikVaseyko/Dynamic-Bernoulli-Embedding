 Leishmania donovani promastigotes contain intense tartrate-resistant cell surface acid phosphatase (ACP1) blocks superoxide anion production activated human neutrophils [A.T. Remaley et al. (1984) J. Biol. Chem, 259, 11173-11175]. extensively purified preparation ACP1 dephosphorylates several phosphoproteins phosphorylated serine residues; include: pyruvate kinase (Km 1.6 microM; Vmax 71.4 U (mg protein)-1), phosphorylase kinase (Km 0.076 microM; Vmax 5.4 U (mg protein)-1) histones (Km 4.86 microM; Vmax 2.2 U (mg protein)-1). However, specific activity leishmanial phosphatase phosphoproteins low compared phosphoprotein phosphatases. phosphatase activity ACP1 also low phosphohistone phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate (PIP2) inositoltriphosphate (IP3) also tested ACP1 substrates. PIP2 hydrolyzed rapidly ACP1. rate hydrolysis PIP2 higher pH 6.8 (Km 2.35 microM; Vmax 107 X 10(3) U (mg protein)-1) pH 5.5 (Km 4.16 microM; Vmax 71 X 10(3) U (mg protein)-1). 32P-labeled IP3 also substrate ACP1; hydrolysis products consisted mixture inositoldiphosphate inositolmonophosphate. ACP1 ten phosphatases tested ability dephosphorylate proteins inhibit O2- production stimulated human neutrophils. correlation protein phosphatase activity acid- alkaline phosphatases ability block neutrophil O2- production. results indicate ACP1 probably blocks production reduced oxygen intermediates mechanism involve dephosphorylation phosphoproteins; however, possibility parasite's phosphatase affects phagocyte metabolism degrading PIP2 IP3 considered.
