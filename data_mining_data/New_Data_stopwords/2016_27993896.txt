 Herein, use lessons learned exercise physiology metabolism propose augmented lactate production ('lactagenesis'), initiated gene mutations, reason purpose Warburg Effect dysregulated lactate metabolism signaling key elements carcinogenesis. Lactate-producing ('lactagenic') cancer cells characterized increased aerobic glycolysis excessive lactate formation, phenomenon described Otto Warburg 93 years ago, still remains unexplained. hiatus several decades, interest lactate player cancer renewed. normal physiology, lactate, obligatory product glycolysis, important metabolic fuel energy source, important gluconeogenic precursor, signaling molecule (i.e. 'lactormone') major regulatory properties. lactagenic cancers, oncogenes tumor suppressor mutations behave highly orchestrated manner, apparently purpose increasing glucose utilization lactagenesis purposes lactate exchange between, within among cells. Five main steps identified (i) increased glucose uptake, (ii) increased glycolytic enzyme expression activity, (iii) decreased mitochondrial function, (iv) increased lactate production, accumulation release (v) upregulation monocarboxylate transporters MTC1 MCT4 lactate exchange. Lactate probably metabolic compound involved necessary main sequela carcinogenesis, specifically: angiogenesis, immune escape, cell migration, metastasis self-sufficient metabolism. hypothesize lactagenesis carcinogenesis explanation purpose Warburg Effect. Accordingly, therapies limit lactate exchange signaling within among cancer cells priorities discovery.
