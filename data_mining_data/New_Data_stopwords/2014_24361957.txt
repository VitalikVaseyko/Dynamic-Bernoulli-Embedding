 Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes serious infections humans becomes resistant number antibiotics. Due emergence antibiotic resistance strains, essential need develop novel drug targets address challenge multidrug-resistant bacteria. current study, idea utilize available genome proteome subtractive genome analyses protocol identify drug targets within two MRSA types, i.e., MRSA ST398 MRSA 252. Recently, use subtractive genomic approaches helped identification characterization novel drug targets number pathogens. protocol involved similarity search pathogen host, essentiality study using database essential genes, metabolic functional association study using Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes database (KEGG), cellular membrane localization analysis Drug Bank database. Functional family characterizations identified non homologous hypothetical essential proteins done SVMProt server. Druggability potential identified drug targets also evaluated Drug Bank database. Moreover, metabolic pathway analysis identified druggable essential proteins KEGG revealed identified proteins participating unique essential metabolic pathways amongst MRSA strains. short, complete proteome analyses use advanced computational tools, databases servers resulted identification characterization nonhomologous/hypothetical essential proteins homologous host genome. Therefore, non-homologous essential targets ensure survival pathogen hence targeted drug discovery.
