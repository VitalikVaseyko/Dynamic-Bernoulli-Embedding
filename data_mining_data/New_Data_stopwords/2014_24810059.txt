 Glioblastoma (GBM) common deadly adult brain tumor. Despite aggressive surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, life expectancy patients diagnosed GBM approximately 14 months. extremely aggressive nature GBM results glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) sustain GBM growth, survive intensive chemotherapy, give rise tumor recurrence. accumulating evidence revealing GSC resilience concomitant activation multiple survival pathways. order decode signal transduction networks responsible malignant properties GSCs, analyzed collection GSC lines using dual, complementary, experimental approach, is, reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPMs) kinase inhibitor library screening. treated GSCs vitro clinically relevant concentrations temozolomide (TMZ) performed RPPM detect changes phosphorylation patterns could associated resistance. addition, screened GSCs vitro library protein lipid kinase inhibitors identify specific targets involved GSC survival proliferation. show GSCs relatively insensitive TMZ treatment terms pathway activation and, although displaying heterogeneous individual phospho-proteomic profiles, GSCs resistant specific inhibition major signaling pathways involved cell survival proliferation. However, simultaneous multipathway inhibition staurosporin derivative UCN-01 results remarkable inhibition GSC growth vitro. activity UCN-01 GSCs confirmed two vivo models GBM growth. Finally, used RPPM study molecular functional effects UCN-01 demonstrated sensitivity UCN-01 correlates activation survival signals mediated PDK1 DNA damage response initiated CHK1. Taken together, results suggest combined inhibition PDK1 CHK1 represents potentially effective therapeutic approach reduce growth human GBM.
