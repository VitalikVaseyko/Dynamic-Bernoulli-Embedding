 enzymes hexokinase (HK), phosphoglucomutase (PGM), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assayed villous tissue homogenates cell fractions normal human term placentas. Although lowest activity probably rate limiting glycolysis, hexokinase theoretically adequate phosphorylate total amount glucose metabolized. PGM PK activity range exceeding HK 10-15 times, suggesting largely increased breakdown glycogen-derived glucose situations need. Substantially higher LDH activities may reflect placental ability utilize lactate mother fetus. enzymes hexokinase found associated particulate matter considerable amounts.
