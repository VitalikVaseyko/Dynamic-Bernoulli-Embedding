 processes involved adaptation animals environmental factors remain unclear. examined mechanisms underlying adaptive potential mouse hepatotoxic chemical-induced injury. Microarray analysis revealed ethylbenzene, hepatotoxic chemical, upregulated PDK4 (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4) mouse livers upregulation enhanced previous exposure chemical. Although PDK4 energy resource regulator induced starvation, expression fasting-inducible genes unaffected. PDK4 induced chemical stress developed hepatic accumulation sirtuin 1 regulating pyruvate concentration activated Nbn ATM, critical DNA repair checkpoint activation. PDK4 overexpression carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver injury resulted delayed necrotic tissue recovery cell cycle arrest decreased gammaH2AX foci micronucleus formation. PDK4 silencing CCl(4)-induced liver injury accelerated necrotic tissue recovery increased gammaH2AX foci micronucleus formation, indicating essential role PDK4 DNA repair checkpoint activation. PDK4 overexpression induced pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) upregulation transcriptional activation several pancreatic genes liver. Ptf1a overexpression adenoviral gene delivery resulted accelerated tissue recovery CCl(4)-induced liver injury. data identified PDK4 novel pivotal factor adaptation chemical stress.
