 Isolated tissues land snail Otala lactea used examine relationship protein kinase activity phosphorylation-induced changes associated metabolic depression. Hepatopancreas foot muscle removed active estivating land snails incubated vitro aerobic anoxic conditions. Pyruvate kinase (PK), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase second messenger compounds (cyclic AMP inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate) measured incubating tissues 4 hours. Pyruvate kinase hepatopancreas active snails phosphorylated anoxic incubations indicated changes I50 value L-alanine. However, measurements PKA activity cellular cAMP concentrations suggested PKA activity lower incubated tissues. foot muscle used tissue source, incubation anoxic conditions produced changes PK activity even though PKA activity drastically reduced. Analysis changes inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate concentrations tissue incubation showed consistent changes PK activity either organ. results suggest PKA Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C phosphorylate PK anoxia land snails. differences values measured incubated tissues measured vivo suggest isolated O. lactea tissues good vitro model system studying metabolic changes associated depressed metabolism.
