 acute bout exercise imposes major challenge whole-body metabolism metabolic adjustments needed multiple tissues recovery reestablish metabolic homeostasis. currently unresolved regulation orchestrated tissues. study undertaken clarify role skeletal muscle derived interleukin 6 (IL-6) coordination metabolic responses recovery acute exercise. Skeletal muscle specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) littermate Control mice rested ran treadmill 2h. Plasma, skeletal muscle, liver adipose tissue obtained 6 10h recovery. Non-exercised IL-6 MKO mice higher plasma lactate lower plasma non-esterified fatty acids Controls. activity pyruvate dehydrogenase active form was, skeletal muscle, higher IL-6 MKO mice Controls non-exercised mice 6h exercise. IL-6 MKO mice lower glucose transporter 4 protein content inguinal adipose tissue (WAT) Control non-exercised mice 10h treadmill running. Epididymal WAT hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation inguinal WAT mitogen activated kinase P38 phosphorylation higher IL-6 MKO Control mice 6h exercise. findings indicate skeletal muscle IL-6 may play important role regulation substrate utilization skeletal muscle, basal exercise-induced adaptations adipose tissue glucose uptake lipolysis recovery exercise. Together indicates skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes reestablishing metabolic homeostasis recovery exercise regulating WAT skeletal muscle metabolism.
