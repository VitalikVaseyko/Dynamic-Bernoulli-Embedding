 exact pathogenesis Parkinson's disease (PD) still unknown proper mechanisms correspond disease remain unidentified. understood PD age-related; age increases, chance onset responds accordingly. Although current means curing PD, understanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides significant insight possible treatments. Complex deficiencies respiratory chain account majority unfavorable neural apoptosis generation PD. Dopaminergic neurons severely damaged result deficiency. Symptoms inhibited cognitive ability loss smooth motor function results impairment. genetic mutations Parkinson's related proteins PINK1 LRRK2 contribute mitochondrial dysfunction precedes ROS formation. Various pathways inhibited mutations, inevitably causing neural cell damage. Antioxidants known negate damaging effects free radical overexpression. paper expands specific impact mitochondrial genetic change production free radicals well correlation neurodegeneration Parkinson's disease.
