 study, modify extend bilevel optimization framework OptKnock identifying gene knockout strategies Escherichia coli metabolic network, leading overproduction representative amino acids key precursors five families. strategies span central metabolic network genes also amino acid biosynthetic degradation pathways. addition gene deletions, transport rates carbon dioxide, ammonia, oxygen, well secretion pathways key metabolites, introduced optimization variables framework. Computational results demonstrate importance manipulating energy-producing/consuming pathways, controlling uptake nitrogen oxygen, blocking secretion pathways key competing metabolites. identified pathway modifications include straightforward elimination competing reactions also number nonintuitive knockouts quite distant amino acid-producing pathways. Specifically, OptKnock suggests three reactions (i.e., pyruvate kinase, phosphotransacetylase, ATPase) deletion, addition straightforward elimination 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, generate glutamate-overproducing mutant. Similarly, phosphofructokinase ATPase identified promising knockout targets complement removal pyruvate formate lyase pyruvate dehydrogenase enhancing yield alanine. Although OptKnock present form consider regulatory constraints, provide useful suggestions largely agreement existing practices and, importantly, introduces framework incorporating additional modeling refinements become available.
