 suppression 3-mercaptopicolinate gluconeogenesis glutamine 2-oxoglutarate rat dog kidney tubules affect amount substrates undergoing complete oxidation. Furthermore, 3-mercaptopicolinate caused accumulation lactate dog tubules. 3-Mercaptopicolinate abolished gluconeogenesis substrate oxidation tubules rabbit guinea-pig kidney. results imply presence alternative pathway phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase/pyruvate kinase production pyruvate citric-acid-cycle intermediates kidney cortex rats dogs rabbits guinea pigs. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase (present kidney cortex four species) 'malic' enzyme (present rat dog absent rabbit guinea-pig kidney cortex) could function role. observations indicate 'malic' enzyme probably implicated phenomenon. lactate production observed dog tubules presence 3-mercaptopicolinate suppressed aspartate formation inhibited 2-amino-4-methoxy-trans-but-3-enoic acid. suggests provision cytosolic NADH citric-acid-cycle intermediates facilitated accumulation aspartate acting 'sink' cytosolic oxaloacetate.
