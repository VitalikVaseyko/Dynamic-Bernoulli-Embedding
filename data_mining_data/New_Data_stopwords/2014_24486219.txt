 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) central regulator cellular metabolism energy homeostasis mammalian tissues. Pertinent cancer biology fact AMPK situated center signaling network involving established tumor suppressors including LKB1, TSC2 p53. However, recent research suggests AMPK exert pro- anti-tumorigenic roles cancer depending context. Loss AMPK activity observed several tumor types, cooperate oncogenic drivers reprogram tumor cell metabolism enhance cell growth proliferation. However, AMPK activation also provide growth advantage tumor cells regulating cellular metabolic plasticity, thus providing tumor cells flexibility adapt metabolic stress. discuss contextual nature "two faces" AMPK cancer, discuss rationale context employing AMPK activators versus inhibitors cancer therapy.
