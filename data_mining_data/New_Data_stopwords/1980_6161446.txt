 Substitution nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dependent enzyme produced identical results number enzyme-linked electrophoretic staining procedures. substitution significantly reduces cost staining adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, mannosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvate kinase activity utilizing NAD rather expensive NADP.
