 previously defined mitochondria-localized PKCdelta signaling complex stimulates conversion pyruvate acetyl-coenzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. demonstrated vitro ex vivo retinol supplementation enhances ATP synthesis presence PKCdelta signalosome. Here, tested vivo persistent oversupply retinol would impair glucose metabolism mouse model diet-induced insulin resistance. crossed mice overexpressing human retinol-binding protein (hRBP) muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (MCKhRBP) PKCdelta(-/-) strain generate mice different status PKCdelta signalosome retinoid levels. Mice functional PKCdelta signalosome elevated retinoid levels (PKCdelta(+/+)hRBP) developed advanced stage insulin resistance. contrast, elevation retinoid levels mice inactive PKCdelta affect remarkably metabolism, resulting phenotypic similarity PKCdelta(-/-)hRBP PKCdelta(-/-) mice. Therefore, addition well-defined role PKCdelta etiology metabolic syndrome, present novel PKCdelta signaling pathway requires retinol metabolic cofactor involved regulation fuel utilization mitochondria. distinct role whole-body energy homeostasis establishes PKCdelta signalosome promising target therapeutic intervention metabolic disorders.
