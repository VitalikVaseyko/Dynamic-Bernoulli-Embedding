 Pseudomonas fluorescens invoked metabolic reconfiguration resulted enhanced production pyruvate challenge hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Although stress led sharp reduction activities numerous tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, marked increase activities catalase various NADPH-generating enzymes counter oxidative burden. upregulation phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS) pyruvate kinase (PK) coupled reduction pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) H(2)O(2)-challenged cells appear important contributors elevated levels pyruvate found bacteria. Increased pyruvate synthesis evident presence variety carbon sources including d-glucose. Intact cells rapidly consumed d-glucose concomitant formation monocarboxylic acid. least 12-fold increase pyruvate production within 1h observed stressed cells. findings may exploited development technologies aimed conversion carbohydrates pyruvate.
