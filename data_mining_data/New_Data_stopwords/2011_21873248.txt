 Spatial compartmentalization signaling pathway components generally defines specificity enhances efficiency signal transduction. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway known compartmentalized within plasma membrane microdomains; however, underlying mechanisms functional impact compartmentalization well understood. Here, show phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 activated membrane rafts response growth factors, whereas negative regulator pathway, phosphatase tensin homolog deleted chromosome 10 (PTEN), primarily localized nonraft regions. Alteration compartmentalization, either genetic targeting ceramide-induced recruitment PTEN rafts, abolishes activity entire pathway. findings reveal critical steps raft-mediated PI3K/Akt activation demonstrate essential role membrane microdomain compartmentalization enabling PI3K/Akt signaling. suggest dysregulation compartmentalization may underlie pathological complications insulin resistance.
