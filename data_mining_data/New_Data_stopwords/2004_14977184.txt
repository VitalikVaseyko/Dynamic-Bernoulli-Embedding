 Recent studies revealed structural functional interactions mitochondria, myofibrils sarcoplasmic reticulum cardiac cells. Direct channeling adenosine phosphates organelles identified experiments indicates diffusion adenosine phosphates limited cardiac cells due specific intracellular structural organization. However, mode diffusion restrictions nature intracellular structures creating diffusion barriers still unclear, and, therefore, subject active research. aim work analyze possible role two principally different modes restriction distribution adenosine phosphates (a) uniform diffusion restriction (b) localized diffusion limitation vicinity mitochondria, fitting experimental data mathematical model. reaction-diffusion model compartmentalized energy transfer used analyze data obtained experiments skinned muscle fibers, described following processes: mitochondrial respiration rate dependency exogenous ADP ATP concentrations; inhibition endogenous ADP-stimulated respiration pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) system; kinetics oxygen consumption stabilization addition 2 mM MgATP MgADP; ATPase activity inhibited mitochondrial respiration; buildup MgADP concentration medium addition MgATP. analysis revealed second mechanism considered--localization diffusion restrictions--is able account experimental data. case uniform diffusion restrictions, model solution agreement two measurements: respiration rate function ADP ATP concentrations inhibition respiration PK + PEP. concluded intracellular diffusion restrictions adenosine phosphates distributed uniformly, rather localized certain compartments cardiac cells.
