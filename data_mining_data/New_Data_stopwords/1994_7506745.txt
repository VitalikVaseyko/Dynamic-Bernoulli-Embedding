 Misprimed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products generated crude leukocytic DNA extract four five patients hereditary hemolytic anemia, course exon 6 pyruvate kinase L gene amplification. by-products, originated abundant mRNA templates, observed seven healthy individuals. Two markers cloned (GenBank accession numbers M64700 M64701). focused studies one human markers associated hereditary hemolytic anemia, human DNA marker B (HUMDNAMB). HUMDNAMB 451-bp open reading frame never described previously. nucleic acid sequence region 303-416 63% homologous coding region bovine interferon alpha-A gene. Matrix analysis amino acid sequences reveals structural similarity two proteins. HUMDNAMB protein expected larger interferons, based size 2-kb messenger RNA detected Northern blot human leukocytes, fetal liver, fetal intestine.
