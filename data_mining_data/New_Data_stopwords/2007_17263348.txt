 simple novel electrochemical biosensor described differentiating differing gene sequences basis DNA hybridization events. Polyethylenimine-modified screen-printed carbon electrodes used immobilize single-stranded PCR fragments plasmid DNA gene pyruvate kinase. AC impedimetric measurements first performed systems buffer upon exposure single-stranded DNA. electrode solution DNA complementary, large drop impedance measured. Complementary DNA could clearly detected concentrations 1 fg/mL. Higher concentrations gave faster hybridization saturation occurring levels 1 ng/mL. Responses much lower upon exposure noncomplementary DNA, even higher concentrations, sensor showing high degree selectivity. sensor format offers great promise many DNA hybridization applications lends mass fabrication.
