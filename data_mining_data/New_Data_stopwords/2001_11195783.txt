 Various proteins/enzymes obtained commercially tested presence endogenously nitrated tyrosine Western blot analysis omitting reducing agent step SDS-PAGE. Histones II-S VIII-S, IgG, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), phosphorylase b, phosphorylase kinase exhibited strong immunoreactive bands. Histone VI-S, glycogen synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, actin, thyroglobulin, macroglobulin exhibited moderate immunoreactivity. Histone III-S, casein, acetyl cholinesterase, DNase I, lipase traceable immunoreactivity. Whereas histone VII-S, pyruvate kinase, trypsin, pepsin, chymotrypsin, protease IV, protease XIII, glutathione S-transferase lacked immunoreactivity. variation immunoreactivity hypertensive normaltensive rat hearts found histone-agarose fractions crude extracts. Additionally, nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity observed non-mammalian organisms including Eschericia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Triticum vulgaris. Upon treatment 15 microM peroxynitrite (PN), strong oxidant derived nitric oxide (NO), apparent Km PKA cAMP increased approximately 10(-8) 10(-6) M. results imply varied nitration tyrosine residues proteins/enzymes may occur post-translational modification vivo, discriminative nitration may vital PN/NO-regulated signal transduction cascade.
