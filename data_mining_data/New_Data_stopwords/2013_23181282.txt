 study investigates effects astaxanthin (ASX) insulin signaling glucose metabolism liver mice fed high fat high fructose diet (HFFD). Adult male Mus musculus mice body mass 25-30 g fed either normal chow HFFD. 15 days, mice group subdivided among 2 smaller groups treated ASX (2 mg.(kg body mass)(-)(1)) olive oil 45 days. end 60 days, HFFD-fed mice displayed insulin resistance ASX-treated HFFD animals showed marked improvement insulin sensitivity parameters. ASX treatment normalized activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, increased glycogen reserves liver. Liver tissue ASX-treated HFFD-fed animals showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation decreased serine phosphorylation insulin receptor substrates (IRS)-1 -2. ASX increased IRS 1/2 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) association serine phosphorylation Akt. addition, ASX decreased HFFD-induced serine kinases (c-jun N-terminal kinase-1 extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1). results suggest ASX treatment promotes IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway insulin signaling decreasing serine phosphorylation IRS proteins, improves glucose metabolism modulating metabolic enzymes.
