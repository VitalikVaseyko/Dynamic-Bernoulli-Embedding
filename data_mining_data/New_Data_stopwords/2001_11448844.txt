 High-fat (HF) high-sucrose (SU) diets increase gluconeogenesis. present study designed determine contributions pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase fluxes accelerated gluconeogenesis (GNEO) absence presence fatty acids. Male Sprague-Dawley rats fed HF, SU, starch (ST) diet 1 wk, hepatocytes mitochondria isolated. absence palmitate, tracer estimated rates GNEO (nmol. min(-1). mg(-1)) elevated hepatocytes isolated SU (32.3 +/- 1.8) HF (35.4 +/- 1.8) vs. ST (22.8 +/- 1.5). Pyruvate carboxylase PEPCK flux rates (nmol. min(-1). mg(-1)) increased SU (47.5 +/- 2.2 34.8 +/- 1.5) HF (49.4 +/- 1.8 38.2 +/- 1.8) groups compared ST group (32.8 +/- 3.2 44.3 +/- 2.0). Palmitate (250-1,000 microM) stimulation fluxes significantly different among groups. Bromopalmitate, inhibitor fat oxidation, abolished differences GNEO, pyruvate carboxylase, PEPCK fluxes HF SU vs. ST. isolated mitochondria, pyruvate carboxylation palmitoyl carnitine oxidation significantly different among groups. results study suggest increased gluconeogenic flux observed HF SU diets associated increased pyruvate flux pyruvate carboxylase PEPCK. Moreover, ability bromopalmitate normalize gluconeogenic fluxes suggests endogenous fatty acids contribute diet-induced increases GNEO.
