 Lead (Pb(2+)) heavy metal long used humans wide range technological purposes, main reason current widespread distribution. Pb(2+) thought enter erythrocytes anion exchange remain cell binding thiol groups. Pyruvate kinase (PK) thiol-containing enzyme plays key role erythrocyte cellular energy homeostasis. delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) second enzyme heme biosynthetic pathway plays role pathogenesis Pb poisoning. primary objective investigate effect Pb(2+) activity thiolenzymes delta-ALAD PK concentration glutathione (GSH), nonenzymatic antioxidant defense, erythrocytes Pb-exposed workers. study sample comprised 22 male Pb workers 21 normal volunteers (15 men 6 women). Pb-exposed workers employed manufacturing recycling automotive batteries. Basic red-cell parameters assayed total white blood cell counts performed. PK delta-ALAD activity blood Pb (BPb) concentrations determined subjects. Pb-exposed individuals significantly greater BPb levels controls. PK delta-ALAD activity levels significantly lower Pb-exposed individuals controls. Pb significantly inhibited PK delta-ALAD activity dose-dependent manner. found erythrocyte GSH levels lower Pb-exposed individuals normal volunteers. Pb-exposed individuals lower values controls several red cell parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume). results suggest Pb inhibits delta-ALAD PK activity interacting thiol groups. therefore possible Pb disrupts energy homeostasis may linked decreased glucose metabolism affects heme synthesis pathway erythrocytes, contributing cell dysfunction observed Pb-exposed individuals. results indicate apparent dose-effect relationship PK activity BPb. PK activity human erythrocytes used biological monitoring Pb exposure. Study mechanisms Pb acts may contribute greater understanding symptoms caused Pb.
