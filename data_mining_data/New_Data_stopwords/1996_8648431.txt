 role glucocorticoids intrauterine programming hypertension assessed progeny rats fed either 18 g casein/100 g diet (control diet) 9 g casein/100 g diet (low protein diet), conception throughout pregnancy. Rats exposed low protein diet significantly (P < 0.05) higher systolic blood pressures control animals, weaned. rats elevated brain liver activities specific glucocorticoid-inducible marker enzymes, relative controls. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity also higher (377%) whole brains newborn rats exposed low protein diet utero, similar effect corticosteroids noted brains 20 fetuses. Weanling rats low protein group exhibited blunted diurnal pattern adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) concentrations plasma. Plasma corticosterone concentrations unaltered prenatal dietary experience exhibited normal pattern diurnal variation. Brain regional 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities unaltered prenatal dietary experience, binding 3H-corticosterone type glucocorticoid receptors hippocampus, hypothalamus liver. Type II glucocorticoid receptor binding capacity receptor numbers male rats apparently elevated hippocampus low protein-exposed rats significantly lower liver (P < 0.05), relative control rats. Programming hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis inferred, observation binding steroid type II receptor sites vascular tissue increased low protein exposed rats may provide direct mechanism modulation blood pressure glucocorticoids model.
