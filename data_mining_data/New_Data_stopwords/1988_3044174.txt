 Aldehyde dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase activities determined erythrocytes various ages, separated Percoll gradient centrifugation, 13 alcoholic patients eight control subjects. total erythrocyte activities three enzymes affected alcoholism, however, youngest cells alcoholics decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities increased. depression aldehyde dehydrogenase activity persisted, became marked 2 weeks abstinence, enhanced activities two enzymes returned normal. observations suggest chronic alcohol ingestion suppresses aldehyde dehydrogenase bone marrow, enhances erythrocytic enzymes.
