 Two antifilarial compounds, viz., 90/55 (7-oxo-1-phenyl-8, 14-dihydropyrido (3,4-b) imidazo (1,2-c) quinazolo (4,5-g) 87/639 (6-Nitro-1-phenyl-9H-pyrido (3,4-b) indole 0.5 2.0 micron concentrations substantially inhibited glucose uptake increased lactate production L. carinii vitro incubation 2 hr. treated parasites, showed increased activities glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. Hexokinase fumarate reductase activities level worms significantly lowered. Therefore appears compounds kill adult L. carinii interfering carbohydrate metabolism.
