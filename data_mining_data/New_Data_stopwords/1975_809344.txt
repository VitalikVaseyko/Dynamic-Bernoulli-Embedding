 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) 5 patients cogenital non-spherocytic hemolytic erythrocyte PK deficiency studied immunological methods electrofucusing. L type immunologically related PK titrated crude hemolysate anti human liver L type PK rabbit serum M2 type immunologically related PK anti human leukocyte M2 type PK serum. partial purification, molecular specific activity erythrocyte PK measured immunoinactivation electroimmunodiffusion anti L type PK serum. Partially purified erythrocyte PK focused continuous sucrose gradient 2% ampholines covering pH range 5--8. PK enzymatic deficiency due two times lowered molecular specific activity PK variants, concentration PK antigen normal range. 3 cases enzyme activity immunological reactivity likewise lowered. 2 patients marked erythrocyte PK deficiency 50% residual activity crude hemolysate non inhibited anti L type PK serum, inhibited anti M2 type PK serum. 3 patients, electrofocusing pattern partially purified PK significantly different normal controls. conclusion, heterogeneity molecular mechanisms deficiency one hand, abnormalities electrofucusing patterns hand, seem indicate erythrocyte PK deficiency due synthesis muted structural genes various abnormal PK molecules.
