 Multidimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry iTRAQ-labeling typically used differential expression analysis biomarker discovery always detect peptides biomarkers samples analyzed. Herein describe results targeted analyses using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion-trap tandem mass spectrometer. MRM approach combined newly released mTRAQ reagent, non-isobaric variant iTRAQ tag available two versions, enables absolute quantification peptides proteins via isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. approach applied clinical endometrial tissue homogenates effort quantify two endometrial cancer biomarkers, pyruvate kinase (PK) polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR). successfully demonstrated feasibility approach 20 individual samples verified differential expressions two biomarkers endometrial carcinoma. PK determined present average concentration 58.33 pmol/mg total proteins range 9.13-87.66 pmol/mg soluble fraction normal proliferative endometrium homogenates. contrast, average concentration PK cancer sample homogenates 237.2 pmol/mg total proteins range 66.10-570.9 pmol/mg. PIGR found expressed average concentration 8.85 pmol/mg total proteins range 1.02-49.61 pmol/mg normal proliferative control samples, average concentration 200.2 pmol/mg range 7.63-810.4 pmol/mg cancer samples. study confirmed qualitatively differential expressions previously observed also showed actual relative differential expressions samples much higher reported discovery study. results validated earlier observations dynamic-range compression iTRAQ-labeling hybrid quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DeSouza, L.V. et al.
