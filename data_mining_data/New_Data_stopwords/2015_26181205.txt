 Reduction mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content induces reduction oxidative phosphorylation dependence fermentative glycolysis, is, Warburg effect. aggressive prostate cancer (PCa), reduction mtDNA reduces oxygen consumption, increases intracellular oxygen concentration, induces constitutive activation Ras. Many essential proteins cell death, growth, differentiation, development, Ras, require prenylation subcellular localization activation. Prenylation protein defined attachment isoprenoids cysteine residue near C-terminus. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme reductase (HMGR) produces isoprenoids, posttranslationally regulated oxygen. investigated critical role intracellular oxygen membrane localization prenylated proteins. Localization prenylated proteins (H-Ras, prelamin A/C, Rab5a) observed poorly differentiated PCa (PC-3) well-differentiated PCa (LNCaP) cells. PC-3 cells exhibited high intracellular oxygen concentration, H-Ras, prelamin A/C, Rab5a localized various membranes (Golgi plasma membrane, nuclear membrane, early endosomes, respectively). Remarkably, exogenous hypoxia (0.2% O2) PC-3 cells induced intracellular hypoxia changed localization prenylated proteins. H-Ras Rab5a translocated cytosol, prelamin A/C nucleus forming abnormal nuclear envelope. localization reversed mevalonate indicating involvement mevalonate pathway. contrast, LNCaP cells, exhibiting low intracellular oxygen concentration, H-Ras Rab5a localized cytosol, prelamin A/C inside nucleus forming inadequate nuclear envelope. Exogenous hyperoxia (40% O2) increased intracellular oxygen concentration induced Ras translocation cytosol membrane. Prelamin A/C translocated nuclear membrane formed proper nuclear envelope. Rab5a translocated early endosomes. specific localizations prenylated proteins dependent intracellular oxygen concentration. results demonstrate intracellular oxygen concentration regulates localization activation prenylated proteins.
