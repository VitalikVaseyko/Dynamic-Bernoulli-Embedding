 Pyruvate kinase activity examined sera group patients neuromuscular disease carriers, compared creatine kinase. following observations made: 1. Pyruvate kinase activity elevated 14 patients Duchenne muscular dystrophy, high values generally correlating inversely age disease duration. Elevated values pyruvate kinase usually, invariably, associated elevated values creatine kinase. 2. Almost patients muscle diseases neural atrophy modest elevations pyruvate kinase activity. 3. ten 17 individuals identified carriers muscle disease using pyruvate kinase creatine kinase eight nine, respectively, detected using either assay alone. 4. frozen stored EDTA-plasma used pyruvate kinase estimation, higher levels, compared corresponding sera fresh plasma, found controls carriers Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Frozen stored EDTA-plasma should, therefore, used diagnostic purposes.
