 Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) key enzyme, master regulator cellular proliferation metabolism; considered key target pharmacological intervention. Using membranes obtained DDT1 MF-2 cells, phospho-PDK1 identified Western blotting, two major protein bands Mr 58-68 kDa. Cell incubation PDK1 inhibitor, UCN-01, induced time- concentration-dependent decrease amount phospho-PDK1 concomitant appearance approximately 42 kDa phosphorylated fragment. Knocking PDK1 diminished amount phospho-PDK1 detected membranes, accompanied similarly decreased fragment generation. UCN-01-induced fragment generation also observed membranes cells stably expressing myc-tagged PDK1 construct. PDK1 inhibitors also tested: OSU-03012 induced clear decrease phospho-PDK1 increased presence phosphorylated fragment membrane preparations; contrast, GSK2334470 staurosporine induced marginal increases amount PDK1 fragment. Galardin batimastat, two metalloproteinase inhibitors, markedly attenuated inhibitor-induced PDK1 fragment generation. Metalloproteinases 2, 3, 9 co-immunoprecipitated myc-PDK1 baseline conditions interaction stimulated UCN-01; batimastat also markedly diminished effect PDK1 inhibitor. results indicate series protein kinase inhibitors, namely UCN-01 OSU-03012 lesser extent GSK2334470 staurosporine induce PDK1 fragmentation suggest metalloproteinases could participate effect.
