 Membrane lactate transport studied skeletal muscle cells membrane vesicles L6 line relation vitro myogenesis. myoblasts, lactate transported simple diffusion insensitive classical inhibitors: positive correlation onset creatine kinase activity lactate transport differentiated myotubes observed could considered functional marker cell differentiation. myotubes, complete analysis velocity curves (direct coordinates, Eadie-Scatchard plots, Hill plots) gave parameters showing lactate carried allosteric multisite system. confirmed using sarcolemmal vesicles specific inhibitors. whole cells, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CIN) parachloromercuribenzylsulphonic acid (pCMBS) inhibited maximal velocity without modifying global cooperativity system. weak effect 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS), low affinity constant (Ki = 22.5 microM), implicated monocarboxylate system rather anionic exchanger carrier system muscle cells. CIN DIDS exhibited one type interaction lactate carriers, curvilinear shape lactate Hill plot without inhibitors suggested inhibitors active family interaction sites common range affinities. apparent competitive inhibition pyruvate (Ki = 3.2 mM) modify transport pathway lactate L6 myotubes. conclusion, kinetic analysis lactate transport presence absence inhibitors gave evidence multisite lactate carrier activity myotubes composed two systems least, related two three isoforms lactate carriers.
