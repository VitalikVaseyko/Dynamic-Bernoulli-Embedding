 Tumor genetics escape immune surveillance concur poor prognosis PDAC. study experimental model set verify whether SMAD4, deleted 55% PDAC associated poor prognosis, involved determining immunosuppression Exosomes (Exo). Potential mechanisms mediators underlying SMAD4-dependent immunosuppression evaluated studying intracellular calcium (Fluo-4), Exo-miRNAs (microarray) Exo-proteins (SILAC). Two PDAC cell lines expressing (BxPC3-SMAD4+) not-expressing (BxPC3) SMAD4 used prepare Exo-enriched conditioned media, employed experiments blood donors PBMCs. Exo expanded myeloid derived suppressor cells (gMDSC mMDSC, flow cytometry) altered intracellular calcium fluxes SMAD4 dependent manner. BxPC3-SMAD4+, mainly BxPC3 Exo, increased calcium fluxes PBMCs (p = 0.007) increased intracellular calcium trafficking characterized mMDSCs. analysis de-regulated Exo-miRNAs transfection experiments revealed hsa-miR-494-3p has-miR-1260a potential mediators SMAD4-associated de-regulated calcium fluxes. Eleven main biological processes identified analysis SMAD4-associated de-regulated Exo-proteins, including translation, cell adhesion, cell signaling glycolysis. reverse Warburg effect observed treating PBMCs PDAC-derived Exo: BxPC3 Exo induced higher glucose consumption lactate production BxPC3-SMAD4+ Exo. CONCLUSION: PDAC-derived Exo cells with, mainly without SMAD4 expression, create immunosuppressive myeloid cell background increasing calcium fluxes glycolysis transfer SMAD4-related differentially expressed miRNAs proteins.
