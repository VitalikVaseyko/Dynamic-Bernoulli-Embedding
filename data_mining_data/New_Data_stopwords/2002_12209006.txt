 Sepsis, potentially fatal clinical syndrome, mediated early (e.g., tumor necrosis factor IL-1) late [e.g., high mobility group B-1 (HMGB1)] proinflammatory cytokine response infection. Specifically targeting early mediators effective clinically, part peak mediator activity often passed therapy initiated. Late-acting downstream effectors, HMGB1, mediate sepsis lethality may relevant therapeutic targets. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) recently identified experimental therapeutic significantly protects lethal hemorrhagic shock. Here, report EP attenuates lethal systemic inflammation caused either endotoxemia sepsis even treatment begins early tumor necrosis factor response. Treatment EP initiated 24 h cecal puncture significantly increased survival (vehicle survival = 30% vs. EP survival = 88%, P < 0.005). EP treatment significantly reduced circulating levels HMGB1 animals established endotoxemia sepsis. macrophage cultures, EP specifically inhibited activation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase NF-kappaB, two signaling pathways critical cytokine release. report describes new strategy pharmacologically inhibit HMGB1 release small molecule effective clinically achievable concentrations. EP warrants evaluation experimental "rescue" therapeutic sepsis potentially fatal systemic inflammatory disorders.
