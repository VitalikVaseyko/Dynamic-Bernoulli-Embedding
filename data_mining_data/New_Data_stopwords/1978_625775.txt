 Mean levels 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) significantly increased erythrocytes (RBC) 43 nonanemic black blood donors (4.80 +/- 0.06 micromoles/l RBC) compared 22 white donors 4.47 +/- 0.08 micromoles/l RBCs eight 12 black donors DPG levels greater 5 micromoles/l RBC. Although potentially hemolytic disorder could defined four (AS hemoglobin, beta-Thalassemia minor, G6PD deficiency), reticulocyte counts normal. However, RBCs subgroup compared RBCs additional 25 unselected white donors, following suggested abnormally large population young RBCs subgroup: 1) normal elevated RBC-ATP normal serum phosphate level; 2) significantly increased activities RBC age-dependent enzymes hexokinase (p less 0.02), pyruvate kinase (p less 0.05), glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (p less 0.01), normal activity phosphoglycerate kinase, age-independent enzyme; 3) decreased dense (older) RBCs determined sedimentation phthalate esters. Since DPG increased young RBCs falls RBC ages, loss older relatively DPG depleted RBCs due shortened survival could account elevated DPG levels seen subgroup.
