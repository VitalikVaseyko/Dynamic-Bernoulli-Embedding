 previous works indicated mitochondrion primary target nephrotoxicity induced andrographolide sodium bisulfate (ASB), mechanisms ASB-induced nephrotoxicity remained largely unknown. study, proteomic analysis used explore changes renal mitochondrial proteome SD rats treatment ASB. SD rats intraperitoneally administered ASB (100, 600mg/kg/d) 7 days. Renal impairment evaluated pathological observation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), well matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), applied identification mitochondrial protein validated Western blotting. Protein-protein interactions analyzed using Web-based bioinformatics tool (STRING, version 9.1). Rat kidneys exhibited histopathological changes treatment ASB, 13 proteins significantly changed, including ES1 protein homolog, heat shock cognate 71kDa protein, peroxiredoxin-1 (Prdx1), cytochrome C oxidase subunit 5B (COX5B), prohibitin (PHB), threonine-tRNA ligase, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta (PDH-beta), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 (VDAC2), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1), adenylate kinase 2 (KAD2) others. data demonstrated expression levels several proteins significantly changed mitochondria, proteins could candidate biomarkers ASB-induced nephrotoxicity.
