 Glioma tumors refractory conventional treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme aggressive type primary brain tumors humans. study, introduce oxidative stress-energy depletion (OSED) therapy new suggested treatment glioblastoma. OSED utilizes D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), promising therapeutic protein induces oxidative stress apoptosis generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). OSED combines DAO 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), hexokinase II (HK II) inhibitor interferes Warburg effect, metabolic alteration tumor cells characterized enhanced aerobic glycolysis. data revealed 3BP induced depletion energetic capabilities glioma cells. 3BP induced H2O2 production novel mechanism action. C6 glioma transfected DAO treated D-serine together 3BP-sensitized glioma cells 3BP decreased markedly proliferation, clonogenic power viability three-dimensional tumor model lesser effect normal astrocytes. DAO gene therapy using atelocollagen vivo transfection agent proved effective glioma tumor model Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, especially combination 3BP. OSED treatment safe tolerable SD rats. OSED therapy may promising therapeutic modality glioma.
