 isoform pyruvate kinase brain muscle mammals (M(1)-PYK) allosterically inhibited phenylalanine. Initial observations model allosteric system indicate Ala binds competitively Phe, elicits minimal allosteric response. Thus, allosteric ligand system must requirements eliciting allosteric response addition requirements binding. Phe analogues used dissect chemical properties Phe responsible eliciting allosteric response. first demonstrate l-2-aminopropanaldehyde substructure amino acid ligand primarily responsible binding M(1)-PYK. Since allosteric response Ala minimal linear addition methyl groups beyond beta-carbon increase magnitude allosteric response, conclude moieties beyond beta-carbon primarily responsible allostery. Instead all-or-none mechanism allostery, findings support idea bulk hydrophobic side chain, aromatic nature, primary determinant magnitude observed allosteric inhibition. use results direct structural studies resulted 1.65 structure M(1)-PYK Ala bound. coordination Ala allosteric amino acid binding site confirms binding role l-2-aminopropanaldehyde substructure ligand. Collectively, study confirms ligand chemical regions specific eliciting allosteric signal addition chemical regions necessary binding.
