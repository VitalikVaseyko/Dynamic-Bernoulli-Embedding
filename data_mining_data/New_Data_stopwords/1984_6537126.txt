 Wistar rats used study effects cernitins, i.e. aqueous oil extracts pollens, metabolic adaptation soleus muscle exercise, vibration raised ambient temperature. animals exposed selected combinations factors 5 days 1.5 hour daily. part animals given orally cernitins daily doses 6 mg/kg body weight 10 days exposure. Among adaptation changes studied soleus muscle, 24 hours last exposure, cernitins caused: reduction amount total protein, increase proportion soluble proteins protein fraction, increase tissue oxygen consumption, increase already elevated pyruvate kinase activity, rise ATP level, increase lactic dehydrogenase activity, rise activity cholinesterases. Moreover, increased significantly body weight weight studied soleus muscle. Cernitins, combination certain types exposure used experiment, exerted catabolic action, increased rate anaerobic metabolism enhanced adaptation exercise, vibration temperature. direction adaptation changes depended type exposure environmental factors.
