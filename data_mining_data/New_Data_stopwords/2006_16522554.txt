 Pyrimidine 5' -nucleotidase (P5'N-1) deficiency third common enzyme abnormality glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase causing hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. disease transmitted autosomal recessive trait. degree hemolysis generally mild-to moderate. hallmark enzyme deficiency presence pronounced basophylic stippling red blood cell peripheral blood smear together accumulation pyrimidine nucleotides within erythrocytes. correlation found residual activity degree hemolysis. structural human gene P5'N-1 available fifteen different mutations identified far. recently, functional analysis P5'N-1 mutants performed providing rationale pathological effects mutations. mutations investigated affect amino acid residues unambiguously essential catalytic efficiency and/or protein stability, suggesting drastic reduction enzyme activity red blood cells patients affected disorder. Nevertheless, patients exhibit high residual P5'N-1 activity, suggesting P5'N-1 deficiency compensate nucleotidases and/or alternative pathways nucleotide metabolism. specific therapy P5'N-1 deficiency available.
