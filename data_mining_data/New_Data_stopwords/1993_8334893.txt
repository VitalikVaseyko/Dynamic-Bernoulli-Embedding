 Nineteen healthy young women, non-smokers normal weight, used combined oral contraceptive, consisting 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol 150 micrograms desogestrel, 9 cycles investigated starting oral contraceptive use, 3rd, 6th 9th cycle. cases, antioxidant erythrocyte enzyme activities, superoxide-dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-Px), determined. Pyruvate-kinase (PK) activity also considered predictable index age constancy erythrocyte population. steady, significant increase GSH-Px CAT enzyme activities found. significant variations found SOD PK enzyme levels. findings clearly suggest use combined oral contraceptives leads increase antioxidant defenses. specific physiological biochemical mechanisms response merit investigation.
