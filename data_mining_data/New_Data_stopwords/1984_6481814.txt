 effect ischaemia concentration active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex investigated glucose perfused hearts normal rats fed normal diet high fat diet starved 48 h; hearts alloxan-diabetic rats. Global ischaemia induced low flow (approx. 1 ml/min) lowered concentration active complex experimental conditions employed. Parallel studies showed anoxia K+ arrest heart effects similar ischaemia suggested hypoxia decreased mechanical activity heart may responsible effects low flow ischaemia. Evidence reviewed effects low flow ischaemia, K+ arrest anoxia may mediated activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase increased reduction mitochondrial NAD+. hearts normal rats normal diet, global ischaemia induced zero flow regional ischaemia induced coronary artery ligation increased concentration active complex. Evidence given may result combination anoxia acidosis. aerobic perfusions 60 mmHg, concentrations active complex ranked order: normal diet greater high fat diet greater 48 h starved greater alloxan diabetic. order maintained concentration active complex increased perfusion 120 mmHg lowered global ischaemia induced zero flow.
