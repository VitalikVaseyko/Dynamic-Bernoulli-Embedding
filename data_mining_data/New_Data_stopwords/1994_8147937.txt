 OBJECTIVE: evaluate use lactate: pyruvate ratio test detection zidovudine myopathy. METHODS: Twenty consecutive human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients muscle involvement 20 without muscle involvement studied prospectively. Blood lactate pyruvate levels serum creatine kinase levels tested, muscle involvement assessed clinically electrophysiologically, muscle biopsy performed patients myopathy. RESULTS: Nine patients biopsy-proven zidovudine myopathy. 9 high lactate:pyruvate ratio, elevations 2 2 determinations 6 patients 1 2 3 patients. Two 11 patients myopathies 2 20 patients without myopathy high lactate:pyruvate ratio 1 2 determinations. CONCLUSION: lactate:pyruvate ratio, determined repeatedly, sensitive test detecting mitochondrial muscular toxicity zidovudine.
