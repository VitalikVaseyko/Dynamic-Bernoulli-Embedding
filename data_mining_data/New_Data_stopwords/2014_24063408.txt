 BACKGROUND: study pathogenesis diabetic cardiomyopathy, reliable animal models type 2 diabetes required. Physiologically relevant rodent models needed, replicate human pathology also mimic disease process. characterised cardiac metabolic abnormalities, investigated optimal experimental approach inducing disease, new model type 2 diabetes. METHODS RESULTS: Male Wistar rats fed high-fat diet three weeks, single intraperitoneal injection low dose streptozotocin (STZ) fourteen days 15, 20, 25 30 mg/kg body weight. Compared chow-fed high-fat diet fed control rats, high-fat diet combination doses 15-25 mg/kg STZ change insulin concentrations rats maintained body weight. contrast, 30 mg/kg STZ induced hypoinsulinaemia, hyperketonaemia weight loss. dose-dependent increase blood glucose plasma lipids increasing concentrations STZ. Cardiac hepatic triglycerides increased doses STZ, contrast, cardiac glycogen concentrations increased dose-dependent manner increasing STZ concentrations. Cardiac glucose transporter 4 protein levels decreased, whereas fatty acid metabolism-regulated proteins, including uncoupling protein 3 pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4, increased increasing doses STZ. Cardiac PDH activity displayed dose-dependent relationship enzyme activity STZ concentration. Cardiac insulin-stimulated glycolytic rates decreased 17% 15 mg/kg STZ high-fat fed diabetic rats compared control rats, effect cardiac contractile function. CONCLUSIONS: High-fat feeding combination low dose STZ induced cardiac metabolic changes mirror decrease glucose metabolism increase fat metabolism diabetic patients. low doses 15-25 mg/kg STZ induced type 2 diabetic phenotype, higher doses closely recapitulated type 1 diabetes, demonstrating severity diabetes modified according requirements study.
