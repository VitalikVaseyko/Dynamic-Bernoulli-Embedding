 Proliferating tumour cells express glycolytic isoenzyme, pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK), occurs highly active tetrameric form dimeric form low affinity phosphoenolpyruvate. switch two forms regulates glycolytic phosphometabolite pools interaction glycolysis glutaminolysis. present study, show effects oncoprotein E7 human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 (E7)-transformation two NIH 3T3 cell strains different metabolic characteristics. E7-transformation high glycolytic NIH 3T3 cell strain led shift M2-PK dimeric form and, consequence, decrease cellular pyruvate kinase mass-action ratio, glycolytic flux rate (ATP+GTP)/(UTP+CTP) ratio, well increase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) levels, glutamine consumption cell proliferation. low glycolytic NIH 3T3 cell strain characterized high pyruvate glutamine consumption rates intrinsically large amount dimeric form M2-PK, correlated high FBP levels, low (ATP+GTP)/(CTP+UTP) ratio high proliferation rate. E7-transformation cell strain led alteration glycolytic-enzyme complex correlates increase pyruvate glutamine consumption slight increase flow glucose lactate. association phosphoglyceromutase within glycolytic-enzyme complex led increase glucose serine consumption disruption linkage glucose consumption glutaminolysis. NIH 3T3 cell lines, transformation increased glutaminolysis positive correlation alanine lactate production.
