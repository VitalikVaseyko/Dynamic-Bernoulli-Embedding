 Nitrogen mustard (NH2) Nor-nitrogen mustard (Nor-HN2) inhibit polymerization deoxyhemoglobin solution intact erythrocytes. Metabolic studies undertaken determine feasability extracorporeal treatment related agents. Glucose utilization, hexose monophosphate shunt activity, methemoglobin reduction, incubation acetylphenylhydrazine Heinz body formation performed, well specific assays hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, ATP, reduced glutathione (GSH), survival autologous mustard-treated cells rabbits. HN2 found enter red cells rapidly bind intracellular contents. Metabolic studies revealed significant inhibition alteration function Nor-HN2 10 mg/ml whole blood. Rabbit red cell survival also normal. HN2, however, inhibited glutathione reductase blocked free sulfhydryl group GSH forming serveral addition products alkylated GSH. Heinz body test acetylphenylhydrazine became positive HN2-treated cells, rabbit red cell survival shortened considerably concentration range used inhibit sickling. Ascorbic acid stimulation hexose shunt pathway inhibited HN2, methylene blue stimulation remained unaffected. 14-C-HN2 remains bound red cells vivo, disappearance radioactivity similar found 14-C-DFP (disopropylfluorophosphate). Oxygen affinity HN2 Nor-HN2 treated human red cells remains virtually found control samples. concluded Nor-HN2 may suitable agent extracorporeal therapy, mustard needs evaluated individually antisickling effects suitability extracorporeal use.
