 Ascites syndrome still problem chicken industry various parts world. Despite intensive investigations syndrome many years, pathogenesis remains unclear. objective study analyze difference hepatic proteomics ascites healthy broilers two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Changes biochemical parameters liver blood also determined. results indicated red blood cell counts (RBC), hematocrit (HCT) haemoglobin (HGB) ascites broilers significantly greater healthy broilers. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) level ascites broilers significantly increased, activity total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) significantly decreased. Hepatic lactic acid (LD) level ascitic broilers significantly lower healthy ones. Serum glucose cholesterol level ascites broilers significantly increased, serum globulin level significantly decreased ascites broilers. significant difference triglyceride (TG) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. activity liver hexokinase (HK) succinodehydrogenase (SDH) ascites broilers significantly decreased, significant difference activity liver pyruvate kinase (PK) Na+-K+-ATPase. hepatic proteomics analysis showed 18 proteins expression difference identified ascites healthy broilers. proteins mainly involved in: 1) cytoskeleton; 2) glucose, lipids amino acid metabolism; 3) cell secretion; 4) cell apoptosis; 5) signal transduction; 6) immune inflammatory response; 7) cellular redox homeostasis. Mitochondrial isoform phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (M-PEPCK) mainly participates gluconeogenesis chicken liver. conclusion, liver oxidative damage significantly aggravated, antioxidant capacity decreased cold-induced ascites broilers. Serum glucose level significantly increased, liver M-PEPCK expression higher ascites broilers, implied potential regulatory reagents may reduce ascites susceptibility mortality cold temperature increasing liver gluconeogenesis level.
