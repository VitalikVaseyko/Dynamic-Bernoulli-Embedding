 mixed anhydride oxalic phosphoric acids, oxalyl phosphate, prepared reaction oxalyl chloride inorganic phosphate aqueous solution. product purified anion exchange chromatography characterized 31P 13C NMR. acyl phosphate half-life 51 h pH 5.0 4 degrees C. Oxalyl phosphate, analogue phosphoenolpyruvate, slow substrate pyruvate kinase, undergoing enzyme-dependent phosphotransfer reaction produce ATP ADP. Oxalyl phosphate substitutes phosphoenolpyruvate reaction catalyzed pyruvate, phosphate dikinase. acyl phosphate reacts free enzyme give phosphorylated form enzyme. Removal potent product inhibitor, oxalate, reaction mixtures gel filtration chromatography permitted reaction phosphorylated enzyme pyrophosphate AMP give ATP Pi single turnover assay. Oxalyl phosphate also served phospho group donor partial reaction catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase wherein GDP phosphorylated expense oxalyl phosphate.
