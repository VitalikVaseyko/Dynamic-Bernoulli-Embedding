 BACKGROUND: Heart failure associated reversal fetal gene expression pattern contractile metabolic genes. Substantial recovery ventricular function assist devices rare. goal evaluate effects assist devices fetal gene expression hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), transcriptional factor hypoxic signaling. METHODS: Human heart tissue obtained left ventricular apex time assist device implantation left ventricular free wall cardiac transplantation. Non-failing tissue obtained unused hearts human donors. Gene expression measured Affymetrix 133 plus 2 Array. HIF-1 alpha measured Western blotting commercially available antibodies. RESULTS: Heart failure associated decrease alpha-myosin heavy chain sarcoplasmic reticulum-Ca(2+) adenosine triphosphatase messenger RNA expression along increase skeletal tropomyosin. pattern persisted assist device therapy. Heart failure also associated abnormalities regulatory metabolic genes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). patterns also persisted assist device therapy despite reduction atrial natriuretic peptide expression normalization HIF-1 alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Failure assist devices produce sustained recovery myocardial contractile function may due part persistent fetal transcriptional patterns contractile metabolic genes.
