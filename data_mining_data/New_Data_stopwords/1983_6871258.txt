 L-Cysteine inhibits aerobic glycolysis restores Pasteur effect Ehrlich ascites tumour cells supernatants, D-cysteine effect process. compounds configuration L alpha-carbon thiol group beta-position (penicillamine) restore vivo (3-mercaptopyruvate, cystine L-serine together L-homocysteine) also show inhibitory properties. DL-Homocysteine free thiol group gamma-position, reduced glutathione, methionine products cysteine oxidation (cysteic acid, taurine) inhibit tumour aerobic glycolysis. Glycolysis normal tissue supernatants (mouse liver muscle) sensitive inhibitory effect cysteine. Metabolic studies showing cysteine-induced decrease ATP content, coupled cross-over pyruvate 2-phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, indicate tumour pyruvate kinase enzyme sensitive cysteine inhibition. Enzymatic studies carried preincubation Ehrlich ascites tumour cells cysteine direct action substance tumour normal tissue supernatants indicate presence cysteine-sensitive isoenzyme besides normal cysteine-insensitive pyruvate kinase tumour material.
