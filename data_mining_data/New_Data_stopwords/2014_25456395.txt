 Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) inactivation von Hippel-Lindau protein, leading accumulation hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). HIF-1alpha induces aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, whereas HIF-2alpha functions oncoprotein. Lactate transport monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) chaperone CD147 essential high glycolytic cancer cell survival. elucidate clinical significance MCT1, MCT4, CD147 expression, investigated expressions immunohistochemistry ccRCC specimens validated results open-access Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis. Overexpression MCT1, MCT4, CD147 observed 49.4% (89/180), 39.4% (71/180), 79.4% (143/180) ccRCC patients, respectively. High MCT1 expression associated older age (P = .017), larger tumor size (P = .015), advanced TNM stage (P = .012). However, MCT4 overexpression related variables. CD147 overexpression correlated high grade (P = .005), tumor necrosis (P = .016), larger tumor size (P = .038). univariate analysis, high expression MCT1 (P < .001), MCT4 (P = .016), CD147 (P = .02) linked short progression-free survival. multivariate analysis, high MCT1 expression associated worse progression-free survival (P = .001). conclusion, high expression MCT1 CD147 associated poor prognostic factors. Overexpression MCT1, MCT4, CD147 predicts tumor progression. Reversing Warburg effect targeting lactate transporters may useful strategy prevent ccRCC progression.
