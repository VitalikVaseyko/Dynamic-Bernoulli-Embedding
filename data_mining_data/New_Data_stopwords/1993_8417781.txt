 influence mitochondrial outer membrane binding creatine kinase mitochondrial inner membrane compartmentation adenine nucleotides intermembrane space rat heart mitochondria investigated conditions maximal rates mitochondrial creatine kinase. end, experiments performed reconstituted systems consisting functionally intact rat heart mitochondria mitoplasts pyruvate kinase, competing ADP formed mitochondrial creatine kinase presence high concentrations adenine nucleotides. Results showed removal mitochondrial outer membrane diminished compartmentation effects, supporting relevance mitochondrial outer membrane compartmentation effects intermembrane space. Compartmentation effects clearly seen even KCl-containing media release creatine kinase inner membrane, indicating localization ADP-regenerating enzyme mitochondrial intermembrane space within outer membrane prerequisite dynamic compartmentation adenine nucleotides. conditions, binding creatine kinase inner membrane minor importance. Lowering ATP concentrations diminished extent AdN compartmentation due decreased creatine kinase rates. conditions low AdN fluxes, release creatine kinase inner membrane entailed another decrease compartmentation.
