 Amdoxovir [(-)-beta-D-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane, DAPD], prodrug dioxolane guanosine (DXG), currently Phase I/II clinical development treatment HIV-1 infection. study, examined phosphorylation pathway DXG using 15 purified enzymes human (8), animal (6), yeast (1) sources, including deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), high Km 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), guanylate (GMP) kinase, nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase, adenylate (AMP) kinase, nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) kinase, creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase. addition, metabolism 14C-labeled DXG studied CEM cells. DXG phosphorylated human dCK, poor substrate human dGK high Km (7 mM). Human 5'-NT phosphorylated DXG relatively high efficiency (4.2% deoxyguanosine). DXG-MP substrate porcine brain GMP kinase substrate specificity 1% dGMP. DXG-DP phosphorylated enzymes tested, including NDP kinase, 3-PG kinase, creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase. BB-isoform human creatine kinase showed highest relative substrate specificity (47% dGDP) DXG-DP. CEM cells incubated 5 microM DXG 24 h, 0.015 pmole/10(6) cells (approximately 7.5 nM) DXG-TP detected primary metabolite. study demonstrated 5'-nucleotidase, GMP kinase, creatine kinase, NDP kinase could responsible activation DXG vivo.
