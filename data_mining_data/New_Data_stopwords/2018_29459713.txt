 Warburg effect recognized hallmark cancer cells many years, modulation mechanism remains great focus. current study found member solute carrier family 25 (SLC25A29), main arginine transporter mitochondria, significantly elevated various cancer cells. Knockout SLC25A29 CRISPR/Cas9 inhibited proliferation migration cancer cells vitro vivo. SLC25A29-knockout cells also showed altered metabolic status enhanced mitochondrial respiration reduced glycolysis. impacts could reversed rescuing SLC25A29 expression SLC25A29-knockout cells. Arginine transported mitochondria partly nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. Deletion SLC25A29 resulted severe decrease production, indicating mitochondria significant source NO. SLC25A29-knockout cells dramatically altered variation metabolic processes, whereas addition arginine failed reverse effect, highlighting necessity transporting arginine mitochondria SLC25A29. conclusion, aberrant elevated SLC25A29 cancer functioned transport arginine mitochondria, improved mitochondria-derived levels, thus modulated metabolic status facilitate increased cancer progression.
