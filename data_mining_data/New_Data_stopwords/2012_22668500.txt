 Considering stimulation melanogenesis may lead alterations cellular responses, besides melanin production, main goal study cellular effects melanogenesis stimulation B16-F10 melanoma cells. results show increased levels reactive oxygen species 15 h melanogenesis stimulation. Following 48 h melanogenesis stimulation, proliferation inhibited (by induction cell cycle arrest G1 phase) expression levels p21 mRNA increased. addition, melanogenesis stimulation induce cellular senescence. Proteomic analysis demonstrated involvement proteins pathways besides related cell cycle, including protein disulfide isomerase A3, heat-shock protein 70, fructose biphosphate aldolase (all up-regulated), lactate dehydrogenase (down-regulated). RT-qPCR experiments, levels pyruvate kinase M2 mRNA dropped, whereas levels ATP synthase (beta-F1) mRNA increased. data indicate melanogenesis stimulation B16-F10 cells leads alterations metabolism cell cycle progression may contribute induction cell quiescence, may provide mechanism resistance cellular injury promoted melanin synthesis.
