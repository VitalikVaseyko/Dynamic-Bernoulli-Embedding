 1. Evidence presented exposure epididymal fat-pads fed rats insulin leads marked diminution Km phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. Effects insulin may readily demonstrated experiments vivo vitro secondary activation hormone glucose transport. effect insulin apparent tissues 48 h-starved animals. 2. mechanism effect insulin pyruvate kinase established. observed changes Km appear result alterations amounts bound effectors fructose 1,6-bisphosphate alanine. Rather, effect persists incubated extracts, appears change degree phosphorylation covalent modification enzyme may involved.
