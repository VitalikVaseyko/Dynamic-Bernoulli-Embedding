 Previously reported intermittent intraperitoneal administration ornithine decarboxylase-inducing factor (ODC factor), interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) normal mice induced biological changes hosts included changes pattern expression pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes liver hypertrophy spleen. study reported here, investigated chronic combined effects factors hepatic enzymes using alzet microosmotic pumps implanted subcutis backs abdominal cavities mice. Continuous administration ODC factor recombinant human IL-1alpha (rhIL-1alpha) reduced activity L-type PK, glycolysis-related enzyme liver, induced activity M2-type PK, known marker liver dedifferentiation. Serine dehydratase (SDH) tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), enzymes associated amino acid metabolism, significantly influenced examined concentration. simultaneous continuous infusion ODC factor rhIL-1alpha rhTNF-alpha caused alterations patterns expression PK isozyme activity profiles reduced overall PK activity. SDH TAT activities also significantly induced. Moreover, mice treated combined factors displayed many metabolic changes normally associated cancer cachexia. findings suggest tumor-derived ODC factor cytokines IL-1alpha TNF-alpha might function synergistically metabolic perturbations observed Ehrlich ascites tumor bearers.
