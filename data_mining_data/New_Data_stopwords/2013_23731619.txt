 variety genes implicated cancer induction extensive paradoxically cancer cells behave identical highly predictable fashion. behaviour closely correlated group cellular morphological criteria termed Anaplasticity involves increases/changes in: motility; invasion; replication; nuclear chromosomal fragmentation; structural degradation; phenotypic fluidity. Anaplasticity predictive universal clinical yardstick assessment treatment. understand paradox, perceived mechanisms cancer induction reviewed new proposal made, namely cancer diversion energy required structural organisation maximum energy dissipation (entropy) increased dynamic activities. process driven oncogenic mutations variety permanent molecular alterations re-direct "channels" distributing energy dissipation. organised along fractal networks (Fractal Entropy) necessarily structure-dependent. "Oncogenic" alterations kind create cumulative effects permanently stabilising parts fractal network, resulting fractured co-ordination re-direction entropy increased dynamic activity, universal hallmark cancer. mechanism Fractal Entropy employs Chaos Fractal theories illustrated Mandelbrot figures fractal distributions Chaos theory influence creating fractal distributions behaviours. proposal examined vitro heamatopoietic model (IL3 dependent cells) concerning regulation growth factors metabolism, apoptosis, oncogenesis cell dormancy, suggests new avenues multi-disciplinary research. Summary genetic basis cancer well established, mechanism(s) induced remain obscure. Paradoxically, although spectrum oncogenic mutations extremely wide, cancer cells universally exhibit characteristic profile regardless origin, whose progression extremely predictable: increased proliferation, invasion migration, loss architectural integrity (anaplasticity), apoptotic inactivation etc. understand discrepancy, extensive review performed standpoint since oncogenes directly indirectly alter enzyme pathways control energy management, may critical component induction process; alterations management divert energy away construction maintenance stable complex structure dynamic activity continuing replication, motility migration, architectural fluidity, ie. anaplasticity. diversion would flow laws thermodynamics require energy dissipated (entropy). review prompted model (Fractal Entropy) whereby cellular entropic dissipation follows structure-independent fractal distributions rather linearly ordered, sequential pathways currently modelled signal transduction. "Malignant" behaviour arises disturbances bias fractal network achieve maximum entropy. replication, motility architectural plasticity actively dissipate energy kinetic activity structure-building energy becomes "locked in", routes preferred eventually generating universal malignant phenotype independent types mutations pathways initially affected. proposed mechanism model based Chaos Fractal theories illustrated Appendix. present examples dynamic fractal behaviour Mandelbrot figures Chaos theory initiate guide distribution entropy fractals. proposal accords fully established physical laws recent research, reconciles many unresolved problems concerning genetic heterogeneity, universality malignant cell behaviour, cancer progression, well-known, still unexplained, metabolic Warburg effect. established vitro cell model offers evidence hypothesis suggests new directions multi-disciplinary research origin cancer.
