 Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients diagnosed late stages limited chemotherapeutic options, underscoring great need development new anticancer agents effective disease management. aimed identify novel anticancer agents OSCC using quantitative high throughput assays screening six chemical libraries consisting 5170 small molecule inhibitors. depth characterization resulted identification pyrithione zinc (PYZ) effective cytotoxic agent inhibiting cell proliferation inducing apoptosis OSCC cells vitro. Further, treatment PYZ reduced colony forming, migration invasion potential oral cancer cells dose-dependent manner. PYZ treatment also led altered expression several key components major signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR WNT/beta-catenin OSCC cells. addition, treatment PYZ also reduced expression 14-3-3zeta, 14-3-3sigma, cyclin D1, c-Myc pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), proteins identified earlier studies involved development progression OSCCs. Importantly, PYZ treatment significantly reduced tumor xenograft volume immunocompromised NOD/SCID/Crl mice without causing apparent toxicity normal tissues. Taken together, demonstrate vitro vivo efficacy PYZ OSCC. conclusion, identified PYZ HTS assays demonstrated vitro vivo pre-clinical efficacy PYZ novel anticancer therapeutic candidate OSCC.
