 Hereditary non-spherocytary haemolytic anaemias cause enzymopathies pentose phosphate cycle glycolysis erythrocytes. 11 known enzyme defects erythrocytary glycolysis consequence reduced preparation adenosine triphosphatase condition deficient stability membrane erythrocytes. Therefore, increased autohaemolysis normal osmotic resistance reference forms anaemia, particularly differentiated hereditary sperocytoses. Middle Europe deficiency pyruvate kinase plays greatest part among otherwise rarely diagnosed enzymopenic haemolytic anaemias.
