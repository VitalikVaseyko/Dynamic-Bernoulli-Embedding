 recently reported molecular cloning branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, first mitochondrial protein kinase cloned (Popov, K. M., Zhao, Y., Shimomura, Y., Kuntz, M. J., Harris, R. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13127-13130). search proteins related branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, cDNA encoding 434 amino acid residues corresponding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase cloned rat heart cDNA library. Evidence clone codes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase includes: (a) deduced amino acid sequence identical partial sequence kinase determined direct sequencing; (b) expression cDNA Escherichia coli resulted synthesis protein phosphorylated inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; (c) kinase activity recombinant protein sensitive inhibition specific inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; (d) antiserum raised recombinant protein recognized protein subunit known correspond pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase highly purified preparation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Like branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lacks motifs usually associated eukaryotic Ser/Thr-protein kinases. Considerable sequence similarity exists mitochondrial protein kinases members prokaryotic histidine kinase family, diverse set sensing response systems important regulation bacterial processes. Thus, molecular cloning proteins establishes new eukaryotic family protein kinases related prokaryotic family protein kinases.
