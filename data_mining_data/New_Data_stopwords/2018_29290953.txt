 Oncogenic types human papillomaviruses (HPVs) major human carcinogens. Cancer cells typically exhibit metabolic alterations support malignant growth. include enhanced rate aerobic glycolysis ('Warburg effect') cancer cells often linked increased expression rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2). Intriguingly, recent studies indicate HPV E6/E7 oncogenes cause metabolic reprogramming HPV-positive cancer cells directly upregulating HK2 expression. Notably, however, results obtained upon ectopic overexpression E6/E7. Here, investigated whether HK2 levels affected endogenous E6/E7 amounts present HPV-positive cancer cell lines. RNA interference analyses reveal sustained E6/E7 expression critical maintain HK2 expression levels HeLa cells. Mechanistically, effect linked E6/E7-dependent upregulation HK2-stimulatory MYC expression E6/E7-induced downregulation HK2-inhibitory micro(mi)RNA miR-143-3p. Importantly, however, stimulatory effect E6/E7 HK2 expression observed HeLa among panel 8 different HPV-positive cervical head neck cancer cell lines. Thus, whereas results support notion E6/E7 increase HK2 expression, argue concept viral oncogenes, endogenous expression levels, commonly induce metabolic switch HPV-positive cancer cells towards aerobic glycolysis directly indirectly stimulating HK2 expression.
