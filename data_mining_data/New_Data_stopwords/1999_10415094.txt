 developed sensitive nonradioactive fluorometric assay cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Guanine nucleotides except cGMP enzymatically phosphorylated GTP. cGMP, absorbed Sep-Pak amino propyl cartridge, eluted separately GTP. Purified cGMP enzymatically converted GTP, applied GTP-GDP cycle using succinic thiokinase pyruvate kinase. pyruvic acid produced GTP-GDP cycle reduced lactate dehydrogenase, reduced form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) equivalently oxidized NAD(+). NAD(+) converted fluorescent compound, excited 370 nm emitted fluorescence 460 nm, strong alkali. 20 nmol NADH used assay, calibration curve 50 500 fmol cGMP became sufficiently linear. detection limit cGMP ca. 5 fmol (signal noise ratio >3). Using assay, confirmed cGMP content left atrial strip dog changed 11.4 +/- 3.8 19.3 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg wet wt tissue (mean +/- SE, n = 6) electrical driving 1 Hz. Carbachol (1 microM) increased cGMP 45.6 +/- 9.2 fmol/mg wet wt tissue. results, suggested novel assay cGMP highly sensitive applied various biological samples.
