 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) common cancer worldwide. main cause death CRC includes tumor progression metastasis. molecular level, processes may triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessitates specific alterations cell metabolism. Although several EMT-related metabolic changes described CRC, mechanism still poorly understood. RESULTS: Using CrossHub software, analyzed RNA-Seq expression profile data CRC derived Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Correlation analysis change expression genes involved glycolysis EMT performed. obtained set genes significant correlation coefficients, included 21 EMT-related genes single glycolytic gene, HK3. mRNA level genes measured 78 paired colorectal cancer samples quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Upregulation HK3 deregulation 11 genes (COL1A1, TWIST1, NFATC1, GLIPR2, SFPR1, FLNA, GREM1, SFRP2, ZEB2, SPP1, RARRES1) involved EMT found. results correlation study showed expression HK3 demonstrated strong correlation 7 21 examined genes (ZEB2, GREM1, TGFB3, TGFB1, SNAI2, TWIST1, COL1A1) CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation HK3 associated EMT CRC may crucial metabolic adaptation rapid proliferation, survival, metastases CRC cells.
