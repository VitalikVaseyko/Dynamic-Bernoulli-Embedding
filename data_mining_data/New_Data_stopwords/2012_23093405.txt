 cancer, glucose uptake glycolysis increased regardless oxygen concentration cell, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Several (but all) glycolytic enzymes investigated potential therapeutic targets cancer treatment using RNAi. Here, four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes, aldolase A, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, enolase 1, targeted using RNAi Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. enzymes, knockdown aldolase causes greatest effect, inhibiting cell proliferation 90%. defect rescued expression exogenous aldolase. However, aldolase knockdown affect glycolytic flux intracellular ATP concentration, indicating non-metabolic cause cell proliferation defect. Furthermore, defect could rescued enzymatically dead aldolase variant retains known F-actin binding ability aldolase. One possible model aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation disruption actin-cytoskeleton dynamics cell division. Consistent hypothesis, aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation. results compared studies targeting glycolytic enzymes RNAi context cancer cell proliferation suggest aldolase may useful target treatment cancer.
