 Aims/background-In humans three phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM, EC 5.4.12.1) isoenzymes (MM, MB BB) similar distribution developmental pathways creatine kinase (CK, EC 2.7.3.2) isoenzymes. Total serum PGM activity increases acute myocardial infarction time course creatine kinase activity. present study undertaken determine changes activity PGM isoenzymes acute myocardial infarction.Methods-PGM activity measured spectrophotometrically, coupling formation 2-phosphoglycerate 3-phosphoglycerate enolase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase catalysed reactions. Inter- intra-assay reproducibility assessed. PGM isoenzyme activities measured using cellulose acetate electrophoresis.Results-Total PGM activity serum increased patients confirmed diagnosis acute myocardial infarction. PGM activity peaked 12 24 hours onset symptoms returned normal values within 48 hours. Electrophoretic analysis serum healthy subjects showed band corresponding BB-PGM two artefactual bands correspond adenylate kinase. myocardial infarction, BB-PGM activity increased MB-PGM MM-PGM could detected. immunoblot analysis, normal serum contained inactive form MM-PGM smaller molecular weight PGM tissue isoenzymes.Conclusions-Total serum PGM activity increased patients acute myocardial infarction, following temporal course creatine kinase activity. increase MM-PGM MB-PGM activities patients high expected. suggested PGM isoenzymes, release blood, undergo postsynthetic, probably proteolytic, transformation.
