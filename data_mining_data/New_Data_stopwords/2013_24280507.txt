 Cancer cell metabolism described Otto Warburg thirties became cancer specific hallmark, also called "Warburg effect". Cancer cells use essentially glucose fuel, glycolysis, order meet energy biomass needs insure cell proliferation. Recent advances describe Warburg effect regulation oncogenes tumor suppressor genes. Moreover, mutations glycolysis enzymes found various cancers, highlighting role cell metabolism cancer. review, describe mechanisms responsible Warburg effect molecular cellular level, role cell signalling along implication different transcription factors. cause consequence tumorigenesis, Warburg effect considered promising therapeutic target fight cancer.
