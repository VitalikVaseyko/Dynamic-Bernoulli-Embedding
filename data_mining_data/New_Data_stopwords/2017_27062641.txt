 Brain ischaemia highly debilitating condition shortage oxygen glucose leads profuse cell death. Lactate neuroprotective metabolite whose concentrations increase 15-30 mmol/L ischaemia TREK1 neuroprotective potassium channel upregulated ischaemia. aim study investigate effect l-lactate TREK1 expression evaluate role l-lactate-TREK1 interaction conferring neuroprotection ischaemia-prone hippocampus. show 15-30 mmol/L l-lactate increases functional TREK1 protein expression 1.5-3-fold hippocampal astrocytes using immunostaining electrophysiology. Studies transcription blocker actinomycin-D quantitative PCR indicate increase TREK1 expression due enhanced TREK1 mRNA transcription. report l-lactate-mediated increase TREK1 expression via protein kinase (PKA)-dependent pathway. first report ischaemic metabolite affecting functional expression ion channel. studies vitro model ischaemia using oxygen glucose deprivation show 30 mmol/L l-lactate fails reduce cell death rat hippocampal slices treated TREK1 blockers, PKA inhibitors gliotoxin. effects specific l-lactate pyruvate failed increase TREK1 expression reduce cell death. l-Lactate-induced TREK1 upregulation novel finding physiological significance TREK1 channels contribute neuroprotection enhancing potassium buffering glutamate clearance capacity astrocytes. propose l-lactate promotes neuronal survival hippocampus increasing TREK1 channel expression via PKA pathway astrocytes ischaemia. Insufficient blood supply brain leads cerebral ischaemia increase extracellular lactate concentrations. incubated hippocampal astrocytes lactate observed increase TREK1 channel expression via protein kinase (PKA). Inhibition TREK1, PKA metabolic impairment astrocytes prevented lactate reducing cell death ischaemic hippocampus. pathway serves alternate mechanism neuroprotection.
