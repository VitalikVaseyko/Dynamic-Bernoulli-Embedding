 1. effect hypocaloric feeding (25% normal food intake 21 days) rats enzymic metabolic adaptations gastrocnemius, plantaris soleus muscles studied. 2. control hypocaloric rats muscle relaxation rates 100 Hz 35.76 11.38% force loss/10 ms respectively. Control rats exhibited enhanced force muscle contraction frequency stimulation increased 10 100 Hz, maximum force 100 Hz. Hypocaloric rats exhibited decrease increment force exerted high frequencies, maintenance force lower stimulatory frequencies. 3. muscles hypocaloric rats, significant decreases maximal activities hexokinase (17.6-37.0%), 6-phosphofructokinase (22.7-34.2%), pyruvate kinase (21.2-36.0%), citrate synthase (34.1-41.5%), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (29.4-52.4%) 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (26.7-32.1%), whereas activities glycogen phosphorylase increased (23.8-43.4%) compared control values. 4. soleus-muscle strip preparations hypocaloric rats, significant decreases rates lactate production (28.1%) glucose oxidation (32.6%) compared control preparations. 5. Mitochondrial preparations muscles hypocaloric rats incubated various substrates exhibited decreased rates oxygen uptake compared control preparations. 6. muscles hypocaloric rats (gastrocnemius soleus), significant decreases concentrations glycogen (P less 0.001) phosphocreatine (P less 0.001) increases pyruvate (P less 0.001), lactate (P less 0.001) ADP (P less 0.001), whereas ATP AMP remained unchanged. 7. Calculated [lactate]/[pyruvate] [ATP]/[ADP] ratios exhibited significant increases (P less 0.05) decreases (P less 0.05) muscles hypocaloric rats respectively. 8. results discussed relation genesis muscle dysfunction caused malnutrition.
