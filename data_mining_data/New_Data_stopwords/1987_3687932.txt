 half-saturation constant (K0.5s) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) co-factors UDP GDP less one-half ADP without additions allosteric modifier, fructose-1, 6-dephosphate (F-1, 6-P2) assay. Vmax markedly greater ADP UDP GDP, (PEP) 0.5 mM, activity co-factors equal lower concentrations greater UDP GDP. high K0.5s (PEP) mutant enzymes, usual test concentration (lmM) PEP nucleotide specificity assessed, abnormally low saturation variant enzymes may result higher activity UDP GDP ADP--the opposite "normal situation." apparent aberration nucleotide specificity may thus illusory secondary abnormal K0.5s (PEP) mutant. Example data recorded. Variations K0.5s (PEP) may also introduced enzyme preparation assay, particularly partial purification employed.
