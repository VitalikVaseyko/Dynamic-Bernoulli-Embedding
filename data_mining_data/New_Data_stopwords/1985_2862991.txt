 population cultured rat liver epithelial cells transformed 11 brief treatments N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 9% cells stained intensely gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). isolated phenotypically heterogeneous tumorigenic cell population 11 GGT-positive 7 GGT-negative clonal subpopulations (from single cells) analyzed ploidy selected biochemical, histochemical, growth properties cells clonal sublines. compared GGT-negative strains normal diploid rat liver epithelial cells, cells GGT-positive strains larger size, greater DNA content, proliferate slowly culture, higher specific activities NADH diaphorase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. GGT-positive strains also show greater alteration heterogeneity GGT-negative strains ability store glycogen expression lactate dehydrogenase isozymes. results indicate enzymatic changes commonly observed "altered" hepatocytes rat livers exposed chemical carcinogens vivo also produced vitro cultured hepatic epithelial cells treatment carcinogens. Moreover, treatment cell line chemical carcinogen generates population cells vastly heterogeneous phenotypes genotypes. Isolation clonal subpopulations resulting cell line allows critical examination linkage mechanistic relationship tumorigenicity many paratumorigenic phenotypes.
