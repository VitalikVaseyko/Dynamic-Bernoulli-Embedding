 Directional cell migration paramount importance physiological pathological processes, development, wound healing, immune response, cancer invasion. Here, report 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) regulates epithelial directional migration invasion binding activating myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding kinase alpha (MRCKalpha). show effect PDK1 cell migration involve kinase activity instead relies ability bind membrane phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, PDK1 MRCKalpha colocalize cell membrane lamellipodia. demonstrate PDK1 positively modulates MRCKalpha activity drives localization within lamellipodia. Likewise, retraction phase lamellipodia controlled PDK1 MRCKalpha-dependent mechanism. summary, discovered functional pathway involving PDK1-mediated activation MRCKalpha, links EGF signaling myosin contraction directional migration.
