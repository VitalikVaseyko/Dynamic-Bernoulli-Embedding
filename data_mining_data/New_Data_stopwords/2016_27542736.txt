 wsb1 gene identified important developmental biology cancer. complex transcriptional regulation wsb1 yields least three functional transcripts. major expressed isoform, WSB1 protein, substrate recognition protein within E3 ubiquitin ligase, capability bind diverse targets mediate ubiquitinylation proteolytic degradation. Recent data suggests new role WSB1 component neuroprotective pathway results modification aggregation neurotoxic proteins LRRK2 Parkinson's Disease, via unusual mode protein ubiquitinylation.WSB1 also involved thyroid hormone homeostasis, immune regulation cellular metabolism, particularly glucose metabolism hypoxia. hypoxia, wsb1 HIF-1 target, regulator degradation diverse proteins associated cellular response hypoxia, including HIPK2, RhoGDI2 VHL. Major roles protect HIF-1 function degradation VHL, decrease apoptosis degradation HIPK2. activities suggest role wsb1 cancer cell proliferation metastasis. well, recent work identified role WSB1 glucose metabolism, perhaps mediating Warburg effect cancer cells maintaining function HIF1. Furthermore, studies cancer specimens identified dysregulation wsb1 associated several types cancer, suggesting biologically relevant role cancer development and/or progression.Recent development inducible expression system wsb1 could aid understanding varied functions protein cell, roles potential oncogene neuroprotective protein.
