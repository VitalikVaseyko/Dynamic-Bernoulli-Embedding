 authors report case 9-year-old Caucasian girl, born northern Portugal, chronic nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia without family history anaemia. aethiological study anaemia revealed pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), two previously described mutations (426Arg-->Trp 510Arg-->Gln). Since blood smear revealed features fully compatible PKD diagnosis, additional tests performed propositus parents, namely red blood cell membrane protein analysis. decrease proteins band 3 (15%) 4.2 (18%) found propositus. father presented decrease band 3 (11%). Coexistence PKD erythrocyte membrane proteins deficiency patient uncommon. findings suggest careful blood smear observation may lead identification combined deficiency erythrocyte membrane proteins enzymopathies.
