 activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex PDH kinase measured brown adipose tissue (BAT) 4-week-gold thioglucose (GTG)-obese mice. proportion PDH complex active dephosphorylated form 2-fold higher BAT post-absorptive obese mice compared lean controls. result consistent higher circulating insulin concentration observed GTG-obese mice. obese lean mice PDH-complex activity BAT decreased 24 h starvation increased response supraphysiological insulin injection, indicating PDH complex insulin-responsive BAT GTG-obese mice. difference PDH kinase activity BAT post-absorptive insulin-injected lean obese mice, suggesting higher PDH-complex activity obese mice due decreased PDH kinase activity. evidence decreased activity PDH complex contributing insulin resistance BAT 4-week-GTG-obese mice.
