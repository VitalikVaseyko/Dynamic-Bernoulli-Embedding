 High rate glycolysis metabolic hallmark cancer. anaerobic glycolysis promotes energy production hypoxia, aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, offers proliferative advantage redirecting carbohydrate fluxes energy production biosynthetic pathways. fulfill tumor cell needs, glycolytic switch associated elevated glucose uptake lactic acid release. Altered glucose metabolism basis positron emission tomography using glucose analogue tracer [18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose, widely used clinical application tumor diagnosis monitoring. hand, high levels lactate associated poor clinical outcome several types human cancers. Although lactic acid initially considered merely indicator glycolytic flux, many evidences originally study normal tissue physiology recently transposed tumor situation indicate lactic acid, i.e. lactate anion protons, directly contributes tumor growth progression. Here, briefly review current knowledge pertaining lactic acidosis metastasis, lactate shuttles, influence lactate redox homeostasis, lactate signaling lactate-induced angiogenesis cancer context. monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 MCT4 confirmed prominent facilitators lactate exchanges cancer cells different metabolic behaviors cancer stromal cells. therefore address function regulation MCTs, highlighting MCT1 novel anticancer target. MCT1 inhibition allows simultaneously disrupt metabolic cooperativity angiogenesis cancer agent, opening new path novel anticancer therapies.
