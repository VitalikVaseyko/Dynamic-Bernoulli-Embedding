 BACKGROUND: Fecal markers might predict response anti-TNFalpha ulcerative colitis (UC). AIMS: compare performance fecal calprotectin (fCal), lactoferrin (fLact), M2-PK (fM2-PK), neopterin (fNeo), zonulin (fZon) predict response therapy active UC patients. METHODS: Disease activity 31 consecutive patients active UC, treated infliximab (IFX) assessed Mayo score baseline week 14 partial Mayo score W52 stool samples collected fecal marker measurements W0, W2, W14. RESULTS: W14, 19 patients (61%) responders IFX induction. median levels fCal, fLact fM2-PK drop dramatically baseline W14 clinical responders. W2, fM2-PK, fLact fCal levels predicted accurately response IFX induction. W14, fLact, fCal, fM2-PK individually reliable markers predict sustained response W52. performances fNeo fZon weaker setting. CONCLUSIONS: performance fM2-PK W2 predict response induction therapy IFX superior fLact fCal, whereas monitoring fLact best tool predict adequately course disease one year maintenance IFX UC.
