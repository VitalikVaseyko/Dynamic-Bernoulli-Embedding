 L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) key glycolytic enzyme regulating flux metabolites pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate cycle (1). regulation L-PK complex involving hormones nutrients. found feeding rats diets containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly inhibits hepatic pyruvate kinase enzyme activity (> 60%) suppresses mRNAPK abundance (> 70%). Studies primary hepatocytes indicate PUFA act directly hepatocytes. Specifically, arachidonic (20:4, omega 6) eicosapentaenoic (20:5, omega 3) acid suppressed mRNAPK llevels activity transfected PKCAT (-4300/+12) fusion gene > 70%. due inhibition insulin/glucose-mediated transactivation L-PKCAT. Deletion analysis localized PUFA-regulated cis-acting elements region within L-PK proximal promoter, i.e. -197 -96 base pairs. region binds two transcription factors involved hormone/nutrient regulation L-PK gene transcription, i.e. major late transcription factor-like factor HNF-4. Linker scanning mutation analysis localized PUFA-regulated cis-acting elements vicinity HNF-4 binding site. Thus, PUFA-regulated factors abrogate insulin/glucose activation L-PK gene transcription targeting HNF-4 elements. studies suggest PUFA may significant effects hepatic carbohydrate metabolism inhibiting L-PK side pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate cycle.
