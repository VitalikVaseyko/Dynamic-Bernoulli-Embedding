 reversal humic matter-induced inhibition callus growth metabolism 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) studied Pinus laricio. Two forest humic fractions (relative molecular mass (Mr) > 3500), derived soil Fagus sylvatica (Fs) Abies alba (Aa) plantation, used. Pinus laricio callus grown subculture period (4 weeks) Basal Murashige Skoog (MS) medium plus forest humic matters (Fs Aa), concentration 1 mg C/l, transferred, additional four weeks, MS medium culture without humic matter, different hormones: indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 2 mg/l) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, 0.5 mg/l) and/or 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP, 0.25 mg/l). Growth calluse, glucose, fructose, sucrose contents, activities soluble bound invertases, glucokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase monitored. results show negative effect humic fractions callus growth, due decreased utilization glucose fructose, decreased activities glycolytic enzymes. effects reversible. Substitution humic fractions 2,4-D+BAP 2,4-D followed increase glycolytic enzyme activities and, consequently, utilization glucose fructose induces restart growth. contrast, inhibitory effects humic fractions persist substituted BAP alone, indicating auxin 2,4-D capable reversing negative effects. possible competitive action auxin-binding site 2,4-D chemical structures forest humic fractions suggested.
