 authors examined dynamicaly third day third month activity enzymes, participating glycolysis (ALD, PK, LDH), pentosemonophosphate shunt (G6P-DH), citric cycle (MDH, INDH) myocardium rats hypertension, induced method Selye, modified Kolarova. phase changes enzymatic activity myocardium, manifested first stages lowering (LDH, ALD, INDH) elevation (MDH, PK, G6-DH). activity examined enzymes control group thirteenth day, also oscillations nineteenth day. actimity G6-DH revealed progressive elevation whole experimental period. changes enzymic activity myocardium first stages interpreted sign nonspecific adaptation changed conditions heart activity. later changes manifestations disturbances various metabolic links, unevenly involved processes myocardial hypertrophy.
