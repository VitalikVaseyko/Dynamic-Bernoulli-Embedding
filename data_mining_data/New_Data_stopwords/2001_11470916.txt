 Carbohydrates mediate conversion triglycerides liver promoting rapid posttranslational activation rate-limiting glycolytic lipogenic enzymes transcriptional induction genes encoding many enzymes. mechanism elevated carbohydrate levels affect transcription genes remains unknown. report purification identification transcription factor recognizes carbohydrate response element (ChRE) within promoter L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) gene. DNA-binding activity ChRE-binding protein (ChREBP) rat livers specifically induced high carbohydrate diet. ChREBP's DNA-binding specificity vitro precisely correlates promoter activity vivo. Furthermore, forced ChREBP overexpression primary hepatocytes activates transcription L-type Pyruvate kinase promoter response high glucose levels. DNA-binding activity ChREBP modulated vitro means changes phosphorylation state, suggesting possible mode glucose-responsive regulation. ChREBP likely critical optimal long-term storage excess carbohydrates fats, may contribute imbalance nutrient utilization storage characteristic obesity.
