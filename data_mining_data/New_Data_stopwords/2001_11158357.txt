 mechanisms weak acid preservative benzoic acid inhibits growth Saccharomyces cerevisiae investigated. reduction pyruvate kinase level, decreases glycolytic flux, increase sensitivity yeast benzoic acid. However, decrease 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PF1K), affect glycolytic flux, increase sensitivity benzoic acid. Also, resistance increased elevating PF1K levels. Hence, resistance benzoic acid dependent upon optimum glycolytic flux, upon adequate PF1K activity. Benzoic acid shown depress fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels YKC14, mutant low PF1K levels. effect partially suppressed overexpressing constitutively active 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (Pfk26(Asp644)) inactivating fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (in Deltafbp26 mutant). inactivation PF2K (in Deltapfk26 Deltapfk27 mutant) increased benzoic acid sensitivity. Therefore, antimicrobial effects benzoic acid relieved, least part, genetic manipulation PF1K fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels.
