 Three variants pyruvate kinase described marked reduction activity associated severe non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. variant shows reduced K0.5 PEP (the value intercept abscissa Hill plot) reduced Hill coefficient; FDP activation ATP inhibition less normal utilization GDP increased. variants slightly less inhibited 2,3DPG controls require FDP relieve inhibition. Cases 1 2 decreased thermostability case 3 normal. mutant enzymes distinguished affinity FDP. kinetic physicochemical properties compared known cases high affinity PEP discussed terms R equilibrium model model allosteric enzymes.
