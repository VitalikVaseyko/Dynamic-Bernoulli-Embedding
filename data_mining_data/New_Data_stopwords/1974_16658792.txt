 Increasing levels CO(2) shown stimulate rate photosynthesis, eliminate oxygen inhibition photosynthesis (Warburg effect), decrease glycolate formation isolated spinach chloroplasts. Ribose 5-phosphate fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations 5 10 mum also stimulate rate plastid photosynthesis eliminate Warburg effect. contrast effect high CO(2) levels, sugar phosphates little effect glycolate formation. Evidence presented show level intermediates photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle may influence Warburg effect vivo. postulated formation glycolate causal factor Warburg effect.
