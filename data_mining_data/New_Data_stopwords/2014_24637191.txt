 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Folk medicine uses aqueous alcoholic extracts Petiveria alliacea (Phytolaccaceae) leukemia breast cancer treatment Caribbean, Central South America. Herein, validated biological activity Petiveria alliacea fraction using metastatic breast adenocarcinoma model (4T1). MATERIALS METHODS: Petiveria alliacea fraction biological activity determined estimating cell proliferation, cell colony growth capacity apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation mitochondrial membrane potential) 4T1 cells. Petiveria alliacea used IC(5)(0) concentration (29 microg/mL) 2 dilutions below, doxorubicin 0.27 microg/mL (positive control) dibenzyl disulfide 2.93 microg/mL (IC50 fraction marker compound). Proteomic estimations analyzed LC-MS-MS. Protein level expression confirmed RT-PCR. Glucose lactate levels measured enzymatic assays. LD50 established BALB/c mice antitumoral activity evaluated mice transplanted GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. Mice treated Petiveria alliacea fraction via I.P (182 mg/kg corresponding 1/8 LD(5)(0) 2 dilutions below). RESULTS: Petiveria alliacea fraction vitro induces 4T1 cells apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation without mitochondria membrane depolarization, decreases cell colony growth capacity. Also, changes glycolytic enzymes expression cause decrease glucose uptake lactate production. Fraction also promotes breast primary tumor regression BALB/c mice transplanted GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. CONCLUSION: fraction Petiveria alliacea leaves stems induces vitro cell death vivo tumor regression murine breast cancer model. results validate partly, traditional use Petiveria alliacea breast cancer treatment, revealing new way envisioning Petiveria alliacea biological activity. fraction effect glycolytic pathway enzymes contributes explain antiproliferative antitumor activities.
