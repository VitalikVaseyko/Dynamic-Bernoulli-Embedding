 majority human tumors display high rate glycolysis aerobic conditions. phenomenon recognized approximately seven decades ago known Warburg effect. Several key enzymes required maintain high level glucose metabolism found tumor cells. effects glycolytic enzymes known directly indirectly regulated various signaling pathways, oncogenes, suppressor genes transcription factors. Recent molecular biology studies shown multiple genetic alterations related tumor development. Therefore, factors may rational targets cancer therapy. short review, describe several important molecules affect aerobic glycolysis discuss possible use therapeutic targets cancer.
