 AIM: construct global "metabolic phenotype" pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reflecting tumour-related metabolic enzyme expression. METHODS: systematic review literature performed using OvidSP PubMed databases using keywords "pancreatic cancer" individual glycolytic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (MOP) enzymes. human animal studies investigating oncological effect enzyme expression changes inhibitors vitro vivo setting included review. Data reporting changes enzyme expression effects PDAC cells, survival metastatic potential, extracted construct metabolic phenotype. RESULTS: Seven hundred ten papers initially retrieved, screened meet review inclusion criteria. 107 unique articles identified reporting data involving glycolytic enzymes, 28 articles involving MOP enzymes PDAC. Data extraction followed pre-defined protocol. consistent over-expression glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase keeping Warburg effect facilitate rapid adenosine-triphosphate production glycolysis. Certain isoforms enzymes over-expressed specifically PDAC. Altering expression levels HK, PGI, FBA, enolase, PK-M2 LDA-A metabolic inhibitors shown favourable effect PDAC, thus identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, Warburg effect MOP enzymes less clear, different expression levels different points Krebs cycle resulting fundamental change metabolite levels, suggesting essential anabolic pathways stimulated. CONCLUSION: characterisation PDAC metabolic phenotype necessary currently clinical studies successful clinical trials targeting metabolic enzymes.
