 Hormonal control glucose production L-pyruvate kinase activity measured isolated liver cells fed control thyroidectomized rats. hypothyroid rats, sensitivity isoproterenol measured parameters increased: apparent K0.5 isoproterenol-induced stimulation glucose production decreased 8.0 +/- 3 X 10(-6) control rats 2.0 +/- 0.2 X 10(-8) hypothyroid rats (P less 0.001) apparent K0.5 inhibition L-pyruvate kinase 5 +/- 2 X 10(-7) vs. 7 +/- 2 X 10(-9) (P less 0.001) control thyroidectomized rats, respectively. Utilisation specific adrenergic antagonists confirmed increased beta-adrenergic responsiveness hypothyroid rats. phenomenon reversed 3 days T3 treatment (10 micrograms/100 g body weight). Sensitivity alpha-agonist unchanged thyroid status. Stimulation glucose production inhibition L-pyruvate kinase activity glucagon reversal insulin affected hypothyroidism. dose-response curve vasopressin maximal effect measured stimulation glucose production unchanged thyroidectomized rats. Thus, hypothyroidism produces specific enhancement liver beta-adrenergic responsiveness without affecting sensitivity glucagon, insulin vasopressin.
