 Male rats weaned normally (NW; day 30 birth) prematurely (PW; day 18) Purina Chow diet. Serum cholesterol levels activities enzymes fatty acid glucose metabolism determined animals 6 10 months old and, older group, also 2 days starvation. Blood cholesterol levels rose age 10 months higher PW NW rats. difference disappeared starvation. Hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) activity fed NW PW animals significantly higher starved PW NW rats. Hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPcK) activity lower NW PW rats, difference disappeared starvation. white fat, starvation caused fall PEPcK activity groups. general, effect starvation accentuate differences two groups. However, PEPcK activity white fat increased age fourfold.
