 Glutamine, abundant amino acid plasma, attracted considerable interest cardioprotective properties. primary effect glutamine heart commonly believed mediated via anaplerotic metabolism citric acid cycle (CAC) intermediates; however, little direct evidence support concept. Another potential candidate hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), recently shown modulate cardiomyocyte function metabolism. Therefore, goal study evaluate contribution anaplerosis HBP acute metabolic effects glutamine heart. Normoxic ex vivo working rat hearts perfused (13)C-labeled substrates assess relevant metabolic fluxes either physiological mixture carbohydrates fatty acid (control) conditions restricted pyruvate anaplerosis. Addition physiological concentration glutamine (0.5mM) effect contractile function hearts perfused control condition, improved hearts perfused restricted pyruvate anaplerosis. Changes CAC intermediate concentrations well (13)C-enrichment [U-(13)C]glutamine support major role glutamine anaplerosis conditions. control condition, however, glutamine significantly increased contribution exogenous oleate beta-oxidation, 1.6-fold, triglyceride formation, 2.8-fold. Glutamine effect malonyl-CoA AMP kinase activity levels; however, resulted higher plasma membrane level fatty acid transporter CD36. metabolic effects glutamine reversed azaserine, inhibits glucose entry HPB. results reveal metabolic role physiological concentration glutamine healthy working heart beyond anaplerosis. role appears involve HBP regulation fatty acid entry metabolism via CD36. article part Special Issue entitled "Focus Cardiac Metabolism".
