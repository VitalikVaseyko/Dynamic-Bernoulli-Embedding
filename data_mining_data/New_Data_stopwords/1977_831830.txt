 method calculating Km V single reaction progress curve presented. integrated Michaelis-Menten equation Vt = + Km 1n(So/S), may rearranged form 1/v = 1/V + Km/VS, v = (Si - Sj)/deltat = deltaS/deltat = (Si - Sj)/ln(Si/Sj) approximated (Si + Sj)/2.Si Sj represent substrate concentrations two points along reaction progress curve separated time interval, deltat. error resulting approximation depends magnitude deltaSi/Si; deltaSi/Si less 0.3, error insignificant; deltaSi/Si greater 0.3, error becomes significant. Procedures presented correct error. Simulated data application direct spectrophotometric assay AMP aminohydrolase lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay pyruvate kinase provided. method recommended routine Km V values desired. Compared initial rate method, faster, requires less substrate, eliminates pipetting errors.
