 PURPOSE: Senescence retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells crucial event pathogenesis age-related macular degeneration (AMD). study designed improve understanding proteomic changes underlie RPE senescence. Specifically, levels several protein fragments prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells quantitatively compared control cells. METHODS: Premature senescence human ARPE-19 cells induced repeated treatments 6 mM tert-butylhydroperoxide (tert-BHP). Whole senescent cells treated deuterated D(3)-acrylamide, control cells treated normal D(0)-acrylamide. D(3) D(0) samples mixed 1:1 ratio, proteins separated FPLC (fast protein liquid chromatography) 2D-PAGE (two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). in-gel trypsinolysis, relative quantification selected proteins fragments senescent cells versus control ARPE-19 cells achieved calculating ratio signal intensities deuterated normal forms cysteine-containing labeled peptides MALDI-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry) spectra. RESULTS: Several large fragments typical cytosolic proteins, GAPDH, triosephosphate isomerase, M2-type pyruvate kinase increased approximately two- threefold prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells. CONCLUSIONS: study first demonstration large fragments cytosolic proteins accumulated prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells, vitro model AMD. data suggest protein degradation processes impaired cells point new type "waste" material post-mitotic cells may contribute senescent phenotype.
