 OBJECTIVE: screen potential mutation explore underlying mechanism consanguineous pedigree featuring pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. METHODS: red blood cell pyruvate kinase activities family members detected. exons intron-exon boundaries PKLR gene proband amplified analyzed direct sequencing. Restriction endonuclease enzymes used identify presence mutations family members. RESULTS: pyruvate kinase activities 5.89 U/g Hb proband, 3.45, 6.54, 8.87, 7.89, 9.32 U/g Hb younger sister, father, mother, grandmother elder aunt, respectively. homozygous missense mutation T>C transition position 941 exon 7 PKLR gene resulted Ile314Thr substitution proband, mutant alleles identified level RNA transcript cDNA sequence analysis. younger sister also homozygous Ile314Thr. Heterozygosity Ile314Thr confirmed grandmother, parents elder aunt. CONCLUSION: Ile314Thr homozygous missense mutation exon 7 PKLR molecular mechanism pyruvate kinase deficiency family.
