 "Warburg effect" describes peculiar metabolic feature many solid tumors, namely increased glucose uptake high glycolytic rates, allow cancer cells accumulate building blocks biosynthesis macromolecules. aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate preferentially metabolized lactate enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A), suggesting possible vulnerability target small-molecule inhibition cancer cells. study, used FX11, small-molecule inhibitor LDH-A, investigate possible vulnerability panel 15 patient-derived mouse xenograft (PDX) models pancreatic cancer. Unexpectedly, p53 status PDX tumor determined response FX11. Tumors harboring wild-type (WT) TP53 resistant FX11. contrast, tumors harboring mutant TP53 exhibited increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation indices, attenuated tumor growth exposed FX11. [18F]-FDG PET-CT scans revealed relative increase glucose uptake mutant TP53 versus WT TP53 tumors, FX11 administration downregulating metabolic activity mutant TP53 tumors. noninvasive quantitative assessment lactate production, determined 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) hyperpolarized pyruvate, confirmed FX11 administration inhibited pyruvate-to-lactate conversion mutant TP53 tumors, feature associated reduced expression TP53 target gene TIGAR, known regulate glycolysis. Taken together, findings highlight p53 status pancreatic cancer biomarker predict sensitivity LDH-A inhibition, regard real-time noninvasive imaging 13C MRS well therapeutic response.
