 Since increased use antidiabetic antihyperlipidemic effect phytonutrients daily supplement gained considerable attention worldwide, examine effect molecular mechanism Crataegus pinnatifida Bge. var. major N.E. Br. (hawthorn) quantifying expression hepatic gluconeogenesis lipogenesis diabetes dyslipidemia high-fat (HF)-fed C57BL/6J mice. Firstly, mice divided randomly two groups: control (CON) group fed low-fat diet, whereas experimental group fed 45% HF diet 8 weeks. Afterwards, CON group treated vehicle, whereas HF group subdivided five groups given orally hawthorn extract (including 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 g/kg/day extracts) rosiglitazone (Rosi) vehicle 4 weeks afterward. Diabetic mice showed increase plasma glucose insulin. Glucose lowering comparable Rosi-treated mice. study demonstrated hawthorn effective ameliorating HF diet-induced hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia hypercholesterolaemia. Hawthorn extract significantly increases hepatic protein contents AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation reduces expression phosphenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) glucose production. Furthermore, hawthorn decreased hepatic triacylglycerol cholesterol synthesis (including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), SREBP2). increase expressions apoA-I gene high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) detected HF-fed mice treated high dose hawthorn. data suggest hawthorn extract capable decreasing glucose production triacylglycerol synthesis inducing AMPK-phosphorylation hawthorn candidate source antidiabetic antihyperlipidemic phytonutrients factors.
