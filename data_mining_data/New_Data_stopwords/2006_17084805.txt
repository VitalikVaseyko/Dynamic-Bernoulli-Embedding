 aim study investigate mechanism cellular regulation mitochondrial respiration permeabilized cardiac cells clearly different structural organization: (i) isolated rat cardiomyocytes regular mitochondrial arrangement, (ii) HL-1 cells mouse heart, (iii) non-beating (NB HL-1 cells) without sarcomeres irregular dynamic filamentous mitochondrial network. found striking differences kinetics respiration regulation exogenous ADP cells: apparent Km exogenous ADP order magnitude (14 times) lower permeabilized non-beating NB HL-1 cells without sarcomeres (25+/-4 microM) seven times lower normally cultured HL-1 cells (47+/-15 microM) permeabilized primary cardiomyocytes (360+/-51 microM). latter cells, treatment trypsin resulted dramatic changes intracellular structure associated 3-fold decrease apparent Km ADP regulation respiration. contrast permeabilized cardiomyocytes, NB HL-1 cells creatine kinase activity low endogenous ADP fluxes MgATPases recorded spectrophotometrically coupled enzyme assay reduced activation mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation addition mitochondrial substrates, showing absence ADP channelling NB HL-1 cells. permeabilized cardiomyocytes creatine strongly activated mitochondrial respiration even presence powerful competing pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate system, NB HL-1 cells stimulatory effect creatine significant. results study show normal adult cardiomyocytes HL-1 cells intracellular local restrictions diffusion adenine nucleotides metabolic feedback regulation respiration via phosphotransfer networks different, probably related differences structural organization cells.
