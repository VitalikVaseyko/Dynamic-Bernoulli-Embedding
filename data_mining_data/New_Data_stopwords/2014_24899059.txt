 Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) common genetic disorder leading cyst formation kidneys organs ultimately results kidney failure death. Currently, therapy slowing stopping progression PKD. study, identified disintegrin metalloenzyme 17 (ADAM17) key regulator cell proliferation kidney tissues conditional knockout Ift88(-/-) mice collecting duct epithelial cells Ift88 degrees (rpk) mice, animal models autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Using Western blotting, enzyme activity assay, growth factor-shedding assay presence absence specific ADAM17 inhibitor TMI-005, show increased expression activation ADAM17 cystic kidney collecting duct epithelial cells originating Ift88 degrees (rpk) mice (designated PKD cells) lead constitutive shedding several growth factors, including heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Increased growth factor shedding induces activation EGFR/MAPK/ERK pathway maintains higher cell proliferation rate PKD cells compared control cells. PKD cells also displayed increased lactate formation extracellular acidification indicative aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), blocked ADAM17 inhibition. propose ADAM17 key promoter cellular proliferation PKD cells activating EGFR/ERK axis proproliferative glycolytic phenotype.
