 Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Ter mechanism formation two dead-end complexes proposed describe experimental data functioning E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). kinetic model enzyme functioning constructed, assumes regulated reversible phosphorylation kinase/phosphatase, turn regulated IDH substrates central metabolites pyruvate (Pyr), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), AMP. shown using model increasing concentration effectors results increase active part IDH, thus leading increase Krebs cycle flux. predict ratio phosphorylated free forms IDH (IDHP/IDH) sensitive AMP, NADPH, isocitrate concentrations Pyr 3-PG. model allows realistic prediction changes IDHP/IDH ratio, would occur changes biosynthetic energetic loading E. coli cell.
