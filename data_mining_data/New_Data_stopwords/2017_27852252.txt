 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase (Pyk) catalyzes generation pyruvate ATP glycolysis functions key switch regulation carbon flux distribution. substrates products Pyk involved tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaplerosis energy anabolism, places Pyk primary metabolic intersection. Pyks highly conserved bacteria lower eukaryotes. Corynebacterium glutamicum industrial workhorse production various amino acids organic acids. Although C. glutamicum assumed possess one Pyk (pyk1, NCgl2008), NCgl2809 annotated pyruvate kinase unknown role. RESULTS: Here, identified NCgl2809 novel pyruvate kinase (pyk2) C. glutamicum. Complementation WTDeltapyk1Deltapyk2 strain pyk2 gene restored growth D-ribose, demonstrated Pyk2 could substitute Pyk1 vivo. Pyk2 co-dependent Mn(2+) K(+) higher affinity ADP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). catalytic activity Pyk2 allosterically regulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) activation ATP inhibition. Furthermore, pyk2 ldhA, encodes L-lactate dehydrogenase, co-transcribed bicistronic mRNA aerobic conditions pyk2 deficiency slight effect intracellular activity Pyk. However, mRNA level pyk2 wild-type strain oxygen deprivation 14.24-fold higher aerobic conditions. oxygen deprivation, pyk1 pyk2 deficiency decreased generation lactic acid, overexpression either pyk1 pyk2 increased production lactic acid activity Pyk increased. Fed-batch fermentation pyk2-overexpressing WTDeltapyk1 strain produced 60.27 +/- 1.40 g/L lactic acid, 47% increase compared parent strain oxygen deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: Pyk2 functioned pyruvate kinase contributed increased level Pyk activity oxygen deprivation.
