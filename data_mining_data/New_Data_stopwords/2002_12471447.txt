 order isolate genes encoding so-called Two-Component Regulatory Systems lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, cloning strategy employed based suppression alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype displayed Escherichia coli strain ANCC22. Several suppressing clones obtained shown produce alkaline phosphatase activity. Sequence analysis four clones revealed presence overlapping DNA inserts representing two ORFs, designated pfkT pykT, whose deduced protein products exhibit significant similarity phosphofructokinases pyruvate kinases, respectively, variety bacteria. plasmid bearing pfkT shown complement phosphofructokinase-negative mutant E. coli, showing gene indeed specifies phosphofructokinase activity. shown suppression alkaline phosphatase-negative phenotype E. coli ANCC22 due presence pfkT caused modulation intracellular level acetyl phosphate.
