 insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway conserved regulator longevity, development, metabolism. Caenorhabditis elegans IIS involves activation DAF-2 (insulin/IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase), AGE-1 (PI 3-kinase), additional downstream serine/threonine kinases ultimately phosphorylate negatively regulate single FOXO transcription factor homolog DAF-16. Phosphatases help maintain cellular signaling homeostasis counterbalancing kinase activity. However, phosphatases identified negatively regulate IIS pathway. identify characterize pdp-1 novel negative modulator IIS pathway. show PDP-1 regulates multiple outputs IIS longevity, fat storage, dauer diapause. addition, PDP-1 promotes DAF-16 nuclear localization transcriptional activity. Interestingly, genetic epistasis analyses place PDP-1 DAF-7/TGF-beta signaling pathway, level R-SMAD proteins DAF-14 DAF-8. investigation component TGF-beta signaling affects multiple outputs IIS/DAF-16, revealed extensive crosstalk two well-conserved signaling pathways. find PDP-1 modulates expression several insulin genes likely feed IIS pathway regulate DAF-16 activity. Importantly, dysregulation IIS TGF-beta signaling implicated diseases Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, cancer. results may provide new perspective understanding regulation pathways normal conditions context disease.
