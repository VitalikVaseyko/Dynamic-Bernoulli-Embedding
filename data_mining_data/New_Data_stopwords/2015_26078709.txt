 Tumor cells higher rates glucose uptake aerobic glycolysis meet energy demands proliferation metastasis. characteristics increased glucose uptake, accompanied aerobic glycolysis, exploited diagnosis cancers. Although much progress made, mechanisms regulating tumor aerobic glycolysis energy production still fully understood. Here, demonstrate Pim-2 required glycolysis energy production colorectal tumor cells. results show Pim-2 highly expressed colorectal tumor cells, may induced nutrient stimulation. Activation Pim-2 colorectal cells led increase glucose utilization aerobic glycolysis, well energy production. knockdown Pim-2 decreased energy production colorectal tumor cells increased susceptibility apoptosis. Moreover, effects Pim-2 kinase aerobic glycolysis seem partly dependent mTORC1 signaling, inhibition mTORC1 activity reversed aerobic glycolysis mediated Pim-2. findings suggest Pim-2-mediated aerobic glycolysis critical monitoring Warburg effect colorectal tumor cells, highlighting Pim-2 potential metabolic target colorectal tumor therapy.
