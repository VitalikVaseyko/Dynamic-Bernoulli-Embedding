 identified characterized two regions human c-myc protein target proteins nucleus. Using mutant c-myc proteins proteins fuse portions c-myc chicken muscle pyruvate kinase, found residues 320 328 (PAAKRVKLD; peptide M1) induced complete nuclear localization, removal c-myc resulted mutant proteins distributed nucleus cytoplasm retained rat embryo cell cotransforming activity. Residues 364 374 (RQRRNELKRSP; peptide M2) induced partial nuclear targeting, removal c-myc resulted mutant proteins remained nuclear cotransformationally inactive. conjugated synthetic peptides containing M1 M2 human serum albumin microinjected conjugate cytoplasm Vero cells. peptide containing M1 caused rapid complete nuclear accumulation, whereas containing M2 caused slower partial nuclear localization. Thus, M1 functions nuclear localization signal c-myc, M2 serves essential function.
