 Protein lysine acetylation succinylation play important regulatory roles cells, close relationship. Dichloroacetate (DCA), well-known pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, potential used anti-cancer drugs several tumors including colorectal cancer. However, little known potential mechanism DCA-based cancer therapy protein posttranslational modifications (PTM) including global proteome, acetylome succinylome. combinations stable isotope labeling (SILAC), antibody affinity enrichment high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis performed human colon cancer HCT116 cells. quantifiable proteome annotated using bioinformatics. total, 4,518 proteins, 1,436 acetylation sites, 671 succinylation sites quantified, respectively DCA treatment. Among quantified acetylated sites, 158 increased level (quantification ratio >1.5) 145 decreased level (quantification ratio <0.67). Meanwhile, 179 up-regulated 114 down-regulated succinylated sites identified. bioinformatics analyses initially showed acetylation succinylation involved wide range cellular functions upon DCA-based anti-cancer effects. Notably, protein-protein interaction network analyses demonstrated widespread interactions modulated protein acetylation succinylation. Taken together, study may shed light understanding mechanism DCA-based cancer treatment.
