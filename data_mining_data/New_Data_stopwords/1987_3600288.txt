 Individual muscle fibers patients Duchenne muscular dystrophy early stage disease, apparently normal boys similar age, analyzed 13 enzymes energy metabolism. approach avoided serious problems muscle homogenate assays increases nonparenchymal components permitted assessment disease changes different fiber types. enzymes glycogenolysis (phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvate kinase) decreased dystrophic fibers types. Phosphofructokinase decreased presumptive type II fibers. Lactate dehydrogenase increased type fibers essentially unchanged type II. Phosphoglucoisomerase near normal. Two enzymes glucose metabolism involved glycogenolysis, hexokinase glycogen synthase, near normal, third, fructose bisphosphatase, sharply reduced. Two enzymes oxidative metabolism, citrate synthase, beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, unchanged increased. Two enzymes high energy phosphate transfer, creatine kinase adenylokinase, marginally affected. net result leave type II fibers, normally exert greatest force, severe deficit glycogenolytic enzyme machinery maintain force.
