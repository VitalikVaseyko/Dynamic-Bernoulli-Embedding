 activities key glycolytic enzymes i.e. hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase detected investigated 3 strains Streptomyces rimosus differing level oxytetracycline production. samples assayed different fermentation stages different aeration conditions. Correlation level pyruvate kinase activity within first days fermentation process strain capacity antibiotic accumulation final stage fermentation process observed.
