 Creatine (Cr) plays key role cellular energy metabolism found high concentrations metabolically active cells skeletal muscle neurons. These, variety cells, take Cr extra cellular fluid high affinity Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent creatine transporter (CrT). Mutations crt gene, found several patients, lead severe retardation speech mental development, accompanied absence Cr brain. order characterize CrT protein(s) biochemical level, antibodies raised synthetic peptides derived N- C-terminal cDNA sequences putative CrT-1 protein. total homogenates various tissues, antibodies, directed different epitopes, recognize two major polypetides Western blots apparent Mr 70 55 kDa. C-terminal CrT antibody (alpha-CrTCOOH) immunologically reacts proteins located inner membrane mitochondria determined immuno-electron microscopy, well subfractionation mitochondria. Cr-uptake experiments isolated mitochondria showed organelles able transport Cr via sulfhydryl-reagent-sensitive transporter could blocked anti-CrT antibodies outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilized. concluded mitochondria able specifically take-up Cr cytosol, via low-affinity CrT, polypeptides would likely represent mitochondrial CrT(s). However, mass spectrometry techniques, immunologically reactive proteins, detected anti-CrT antibodies, identified E2 components alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase multi enzyme complexes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BC-KADH) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH). E2 components PDH membrane associated, whilst would expected mitochondrial CrT would transmembrane protein. Results phase partitioning Triton X-114, well washing mitochondrial membranes basic pH, support immunologically cross-reactive proteins are, expected E2 components, membrane associated rather transmembrane. hand, fact mitochondrial Cr uptake intact mitoplast could blocked alpha-CrTCOOH antibodies, indicate antisera contain antibodies reactive proteins involved mitochondrial transport Cr. presence specific antibodies CrT supported results plasma membrane vesicles isolated human rat skeletal muscle, 55 70 kDa polypeptides disappeared single polypeptide apparent electrophoretic mobility approximately 60 kDa enriched. latter likely representing genuine plasma membrane CrT. Due fact anti-CrT antibodies independently prepared several laboratories seem cross-react non-CrT polypeptides, specifically E2 components mitochondrial dehydrogenases, research required characterise biochemical/biophysical level CrT polypeptides, e.g. determine whether approximately 60 kDa polypeptide indeed bona-fide CrT identify mitochondrial transporter able facilitate Cr-uptake organelles. Therefore, anti-CrT antibodies available far used precautions mind. holds especially true quantitation CrT polypeptides Western blots, e.g. trying answer whether CrT's up- down-regulated certain experimental interventions pathological conditions. conclusion, still hold scheme besides high-affinity high-efficiency plasmalemma CrT exists additional low affinity high Km Cr uptake mechanism mitochondria. However, exact biochemical nature mitochondrial creatine transport, still remains elusive. Finally, similar creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes, specifically located different cellular compartments, also substrates CK compartmentalized cytosolic mitochondrial pools. line 14C-Cr-isotope tracer studies number [31P]-NMR magnetization transfer studies, well recent [1H]-NMR spectroscopy data.
