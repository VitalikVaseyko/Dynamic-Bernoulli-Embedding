 Glucose deprivation distinctive feature tumor microecosystem caused imbalance poor supply extraordinarily high consumption rate. metabolic reprogramming mitochondrial respiration aerobic glycolysis cancer cells (the "Warburg effect") linked oncogenic transformation manner frequently implies inactivation metabolic checkpoints energy rheostat AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). concept synthetic lethality oncology applied genetic epigenetic intrinsic differences normal cancer cells also extrinsic ones altered microenvironment, recently hypothesized stress-energy mimickers AMPK agonist metformin produce metabolic synthetic lethality glucose-starved cell culture milieu imitating adverse tumor growth conditions vivo. standard high-glucose conditions, metformin supplementation mostly caused cell cycle arrest without signs apoptotic cell death. glucose withdrawal stress, metformin supplementation circumvented ability oncogenes (e.g., HER2) protect breast cancer cells glucose-deprivation apoptosis. Significantly, representative cell models breast cancer heterogeneity underwent massive apoptosis (by >90% cases) glucose-starved cell cultures supplemented metformin. current findings may uncover crucial issues regarding cell-autonomous metformin's anti-cancer actions: (1) offently claimed clinically irrelevant, non-physiological concentrations needed observe metformin's anti-cancer effects vitro merely underlie artifactual interference erroneous glucose-rich experimental conditions poorly reflect glucose-starved vivo conditions; (2) preferential killing cancer stem cells (CSC) metformin may simply expose best-case scenario synthetically lethal activity increased dependency Warburg-like aerobic glycolysis (hyperglycolytic phenotype) critical sustain CSC stemness immortality; (3) microenvironment-mediated contextual synthetic lethality metformin expected enormously potentiate anti-cancer effect anti-angiogenesis agents promote severe oxygen glucose deprivation certain areas tumor tissues.
