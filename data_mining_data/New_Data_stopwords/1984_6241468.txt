 found mice carrying Pk-3r, allele leading loss activity kidney pyruvate kinase, activity heart pyruvate kinase also diminished. Electrophoretic studies tissues mice carrying Pk-3r and/or Pk-3b, allele determining electrophoretically detectable variant, show Pk-3 affects expression heart, M1, kidney, M2, pyruvate kinase isozymes. results, together linkage data, indicate isozymes determined structural gene, Pk-3. also report simple method separating phosphoglucomutase-3 (PGM-3) electrophoresis cellulose acetate plates.
