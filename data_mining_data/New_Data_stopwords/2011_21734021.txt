 Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) avoid freezing producing antifreeze protein (AFP) accumulating glycerol. Glyceroneogenesis occurs liver via branch glycolysis gluconeogenesis activated low temperature. Hepatocytes isolated livers fish acclimated 8 degrees C. Cells incubated warm (8 degrees C; nonglycerol accumulating) cold (0.4 degrees C; glycerol accumulating) temperature 72-h time course. Reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization libraries enriched cold-responsive transcripts constructed 72 h. Microarray analyses using 16K salmonid cDNA array performed 24, 48, 72 h. Expression type II AFP 21 carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid metabolism-related transcripts validated using quantitative RT-PCR. Type II AFP transcript levels directly temperature related. cold cells, levels glucose synthesis transcript transiently higher. Increased glycerol production associated increased phosphofructokinase cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript levels. Levels transcripts (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aquaglyceroporin 9) associated mobilization amino acids fuel glycerol accumulation transiently higher, suggesting common regulatory mechanism. cold compared warm cells, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase [an inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)] transcript levels 20-fold higher. Potent inhibition PDH would direct pyruvate oxaloacetate derived amino acids glycerol, opposed oxidation via citric acid cycle. Levels transcript potentially encoding glycerol-3-phosphatase, enzyme yet characterized vertebrate species, higher following cold incubation. Finally, study also presents novel finding increased glutamine synthetase transcript levels response low temperature.
