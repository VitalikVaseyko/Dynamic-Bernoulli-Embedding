 aim study improve diagnostic efficiency detection gastro-intestinal cancers using fuzzy logic modeling combination tumor marker panel (CEA, CA72-4, CA19-9) including Tumor M2-PK. prospective study histologically confirmed colorectal (n=247), esophageal (n=86) gastric cancer (n=122) patients investigated compared control (n=53) persons without malignant diseases. Tumor M2-PK measured plasma ELISA (ScheBoBiotech, Germany); markers measured sera (Roche, Germany). 95% specificity, tumor detection possible best single marker colorectal cancer patients 48% (Tumor M2-PK), gastric cancers 61% (CA72-4) esophageal cancers 56% (Tumor M2-PK). fuzzy logic rule-based system employing tumor marker panel increased sensitivity significantly colorectal cancers (p<0. 001) 63% (Tumor M2-PK CEA), gastric cancers (p<0.001) 81% (Tumor M2-PK CA 72-4) esophageal cancers (p<0.02) 74% (Tumor M2-PK CA72-4). Adding third marker improved sensitivity marginally. Fuzzy logic analysis proven powerful measurement single markers alone combinations using multiple logistic regression analysis markers. Therefore, fuzzy logic method tumor marker panel (including Tumor M2-PK), new diagnostic tool detection gastro-intestinal cancers available.
