 defective enzymes 54 patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency characterized according recommendations International Committee Standardization Haematology (ICSH). erythrocyte PK activity whole blood calculated considering 16-fold higher activity reticulocyte enzyme (AR) compared erythrocyte enzyme (AE). following parameters turned give good correlation degree haemolytic anaemia therefore serve prognostic tool: patients severe course disease residual erythrocyte PK activities less 33% normal enzymes (percentage activity), patients mild haemolytic anaemia exhibited residual activity values threshold value. Studies enzyme cooperative showed positive cooperative mixed cooperative phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding predominant positive cooperative part appeared cases mild clinical course, one-third severe ones. Negative cooperativity mixed cooperativity predominant negative cooperative part observed severe haemolytic anaemia. Furthermore, determination glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) turned good prognostic criterion, i.e. patients mild clinical course exhibited G-6-P-concentrations lower 0.11 mumol/l red blood cells. case patients severe haemolytic anaemia, 80% showed values higher 0.11 mumol/l RBC.
