 Glycolysis shows different patterns operation different control steps, depending whether level Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) low high leaves Kalanchoe blossfeldiana v.Poelln., subjected appropriate photoperiodic treatments: low level CAM operation enzymes glycolysis phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase present 12 h rhythm capacity, resulting superposition two 24h rhythms phase; phosphofructokinase appears main regulation step; attainment high CAM level involves (1) increase peak capacity occurring night glycolytic enzymes, thus achieving over-all 24h rhythm, strict allometric coherence increase PEP carboxylase capacity, (2) establishment different phase relationships rhythms enzyme capacity, (3) control three enzymic steps (phosphofructokinase, group 3-P-glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase - 3-P-glycerate kinase, PEP carboxylase). Results show hypothesis allosteric regulation phosphofructokinase (by PEP) PEP carboxylase (by malate glucose-6-P) cannot provide complete explanation temporal organization glycolysis changes phase relationships rhythms enzyme capacity along pathway strict correlation level PEP carboxylase capacity levels capacity glycolytic enzymes important components regulation glycolysis relation CAM.
