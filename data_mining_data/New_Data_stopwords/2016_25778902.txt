 Surgery-induced inflammation associated cancer recurrence metastasis colorectal cancer (CRC). constituent gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) frequently abundant peri-operative window. However, definite roles LPS tumour progression remain elusive. reported LPS treatment increased PKM expression activation NF-kappaB signalling pathway, knockdown PKM reversed LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta production cell proliferation CRC cells. showed PKM2 PKM1 mediated pro-inflammatory proliferative effects LPS. Interestingly, LPS promoted PKM2 binding STAT3 promoter enhance STAT3 expression subsequent nuclear translocation. Depletion STAT3 decreased PKM2-induced TNF-alpha IL-1beta expression, indicating STAT3 mediates pro-inflammatory effects PKM2. Furthermore, protein kinase activity pyruvate kinase activity PKM2 required inflammatory cytokine production. Collectively, findings reveal NF-kappaB-PKM2-STAT3 axis novel mechanism regulation TNF-alpha IL-1beta production suggest importance PKM2 key inflammatory mediator inflammatory microenvironment.
