 PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase serves critical cellular regulator cell growth, proliferation, survival. However, pathway altered human cancer confer growth advantage largely unknown. Here, show PPP2R2B, encoding B55beta regulatory subunit PP2A complex, epigenetically inactivated DNA hypermethylation colorectal cancer. B55beta-associated PP2A interacts PDK1 modulates activity toward Myc phosphorylation. loss PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers compensatory Myc phosphorylation PDK1-dependent, PI3K AKT-independent manner, resulting resistance. Reexpression PPP2R2B, genetic ablation PDK1 pharmacologic inhibition PDK1 abrogates rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading rapamycin sensitization. Thus, PP2A-B55beta antagonizes PDK1-Myc signaling modulates rapamycin sensitivity.
