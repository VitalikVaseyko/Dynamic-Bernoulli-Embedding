 stimulation gluconeogenesis glucagon results concerted mechanism involving: 1) stimulation pyruvate transport carboxylation mitochondria; 2) cyclic AMP dependent phosphorylation inactivation pyruvate kinase resulting re-routing phosphoenolpyruvate towards glucose; 3) inhibition phosphofructokinase stimulation fructose bisphosphatase resulting disappearance fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Catecholamines vasopressin stimulate gluconeogenesis starvation whereas fed state promote glycogenolysis together glycolysis.
