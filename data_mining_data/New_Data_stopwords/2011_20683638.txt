 NMR studies post-translationally modified proteins complicated lack efficient method produce isotope enriched recombinant proteins cultured mammalian cells. show reducing glucose concentration substituting glutamate glutamine serum-free medium increased cell viability simultaneously increasing recombinant protein yield enrichment non-essential amino acids compared culture unmodified, serum-free medium. Adding dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, improves cell viability, recombinant protein yield, isotope enrichment. demonstrate method producing partially enriched recombinant Thy1 glycoprotein Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using U-(1)(3)C-glucose (1)(5)N-glutamate labeled precursors. study suggests uniformly (1)(5)N,(1)(3)C-labeled recombinant proteins may produced cultured mammalian cells starting mixture labeled essential amino acids, glucose, glutamate.
