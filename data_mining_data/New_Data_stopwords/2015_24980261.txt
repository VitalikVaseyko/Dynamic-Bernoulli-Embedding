 kidney important site xenobiotic-induced toxicity. traditional markers renal injury indicate severe renal damage, new biomarkers needed sensitive reliable evaluation renal toxicity. study designed identify vitro noninvasive biomarkers efficient assessment nephrotoxicity using cisplatin model nephrotoxic compounds. end, comparative proteomic analysis conditioned media HK-2 human kidney epithelial cells treated cisplatin performed. Here, identified pyruvate kinase M1/M2 isoform M2 (PKM2) eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma (EF-1gamma) potential biomarker candidates evaluation nephrotoxicity. PKM2 EF-1gamma increased cisplatin kidney cell-specific manner, likely due cisplatin-induced apoptosis. increase PKM2 EF-1gamma levels conditioned media also observed presence nephrotoxic agents different cytotoxic mechanisms CdCl2, HgCl2, cyclosporine A. Rats treated cisplatin, CdCl2, HgCl2 presented increased levels PKM2 EF-1gamma urine kidney tissue. Taken together, study identified two noninvasive biomarker candidates, PKM2 EF-1gamma, comparative proteomic analysis. new biomarkers may offer alternative traditional renal markers efficient evaluation nephrotoxicity.
