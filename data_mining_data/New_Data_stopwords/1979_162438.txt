 Methods assaying 16 erythrocyte enzymes adapted miniature centrifugal analyzer. Less 15 micro L whole blood required 16 assays. Variation attributable temporal effects, rotor effects, random residual error minor. Initial population studies blood adults cord-blood samples suggest CV less 12% 12 16 enzymes; thus possible identify heterozygous deficient individual. Preliminary data suggest three individuals, enzyme activity (adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase) half expected, identified, well two individuals deficient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
