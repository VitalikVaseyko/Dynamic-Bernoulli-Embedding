 Previous evidence established sequestered form adenosine triphosphate (ATP pools) resides membrane/cytoskeletal complex red cell porous ghosts. Here, characterize roles ATP pools perform operation membrane's Na(+) Ca(2+) pumps. formation Na(+)- Ca(2+)-dependent phosphointermediates types pumps (E(Na)-P E(Ca)-P) conventionally labeled trace amounts [gamma-(3)P]ATP cannot occur pools contain unlabeled ATP, presumably dilution [gamma-(3)P]ATP pool. Running pumps forward either Na(+) Ca(2+) removes pool ATP allows normal formation labeled E(Na)-P E(Ca)-P, indicating types pumps share pools ATP. also show halftime loading pools bulk ATP 10-15 minutes. observed unlabeled "caged ATP" entrapped membrane pools, inactive nascent ATP photoreleased, thereby blocking labeled formation E(Na)-P. also demonstrate ATP generated membrane-bound pyruvate kinase fills membrane pools. results show pool ATP alone, like bulk ATP, promote binding ouabain membrane. addition, found pool ATP alone functions together bulk Na(+) (without Mg(2+)) release prebound ouabain. Curiously, ouabain found block bulk ATP entering pools. Finally, show, red cell inside-outside vesicles, pool ATP alone supports uptake (45)Ca Ca(2+) pump, analogous Na(+) pump uptake (22)Na circumstance. Although membrane locus ATP pools within membrane/cytoskeletal complex unknown, appears pool ATP functions proximate energy source Na(+) Ca(2+) pumps.
