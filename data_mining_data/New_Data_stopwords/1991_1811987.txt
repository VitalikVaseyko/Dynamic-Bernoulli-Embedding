 possible physiological role estrogen regulation energy metabolism epididymis vas deferens rhesus monkey investigated. selected key enzymes glycolysis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase) TCA cycle (succinate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase) measured two organs (a) castrated estrogen treated, (b) castrated estrogen + dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treated animals compared castrated castrated + DHT treated animals. Results reveal DHT stimulated activities enzymes whereas estrogen failed stimulate enzymes castrated animals. However, estrogen combination DHT caused marked stimulation enzymes response epididymis vas deferens combination treatment significantly caused DHT alone. results suggest circulating estrogen male physiological role acts synergistically androgen regulating accessory sex organ function.
