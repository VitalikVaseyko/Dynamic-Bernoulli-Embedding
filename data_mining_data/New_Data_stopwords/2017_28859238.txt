 Lipocalin 2 (LCN2), member lipocalin superfamily, plays important role oncogenesis progression various types cancer. However, expression pattern functional role LCN2 colorectal cancer (CRC) still poorly understood. purpose present study investigate whether LCN2 associated proliferation epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) CRC elucidate underlying signaling pathways. LCN2 preferentially expressed CRC cells compared normal tissues. However, LCN2 expression significantly lower metastatic advanced-stage CRC non-metastatic early stage CRC. Knockdown LCN2 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) CRC cells expressing high level LCN2 induced cell proliferation morphological switch epithelial mesenchymal state. Furthermore, downregulation LCN2 CRC cells increased cell migration invasion involved regulation EMT markers. Knockdown LCN2 also induced glucose consumption lactate production, accompanied increase energy metabolism-related genes. Taken together, findings indicated LCN2 negatively modulated proliferation, EMT energy metabolism CRC cells. Accordingly, LCN2 may candidate metastasis suppressor potential therapeutic target CRC.
