 SIRT6 (sirtuin 6) member sirtuin family deacetylases involved diverse processes including genome stability, metabolic homeostasis, tumorigenesis. However, role SIRT6 deacetylase activity tumor-suppressor functions well understood. report SIRT6 binds deacetylates nuclear PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) lysine 433 residue. PKM2 glycolytic enzyme nonmetabolic nuclear oncogenic functions. SIRT6-mediated deacetylation results PKM2 nuclear export. identified exportin 4 specific transporter mediating PKM2 nuclear export. result SIRT6-mediated deacetylation, PKM2 nuclear protein kinase transcriptional coactivator functions abolished. Thus, SIRT6 suppresses PKM2 oncogenic functions, resulting reduced cell proliferation, migration potential, invasiveness. Furthermore, studies mouse tumor models demonstrate PKM2 deacetylation integral SIRT6-mediated tumor suppression inhibition metastasis. Additionally, reduced SIRT6 levels correlate elevated nuclear acetylated PKM2 levels increasing grades hepatocellular carcinoma. findings provide key insights pivotal role deacetylase activity SIRT6 tumor-suppressor functions.
