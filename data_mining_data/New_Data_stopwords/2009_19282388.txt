 Mice expressing mutant thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1R384C, 10-fold reduced affinity ligand T(3), exhibit hypermetabolism due overactivation sympathetic nervous system. define consequences liver, analyzed hepatic metabolism regulation liver genes mutant mice. results showed hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxykinase up-regulated pyruvate kinase mRNA down-regulated, contrary observed T(3) treatment. contrast, mice expressing mutant TRalpha1L400R specifically liver show dysregulation genes; however, TRalpha1L400R expressed ubiquitously, hepatic phenotype differed TRalpha1R384C animals, suggesting localization mutation plays important role consequences glucose metabolism. Furthermore, observed glycogen stores completely depleted TRalpha1R384C animals, despite increased gluconeogenesis decreased glycolysis. Exposure mutant mice high maternal levels thyroid hormone fetal development leads normal liver phenotype adult. results show genetic maternal factors interact determine metabolic setpoint offspring indicate important role maternal thyroid hormone susceptibility metabolic disorders adulthood.
