 activities selected enzymes carbohydrate metabolism measured tetrathyridia Mesocestoides corti adult females males Heterakis spumosa. species compared, lactate dehydrogenase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities considerably higher M. corti. Activities enzymes higher H. spumosa, malate dehydrogenase activity considerably so. H. spumosa, enzyme activity higher, succinate dehydrogenase markedly males, compared females. Tetrathyridia aged 170 210 days show relatively stable malate lactate dehydrogenase activities, mice ICR BALB/c strains suitable maintenance tetrathyridia.
