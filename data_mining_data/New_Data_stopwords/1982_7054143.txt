 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) Streptococcus mutans strain JC2 purified, giving single band sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. molecular weight native enzyme 180,000 190,000, enzyme considered consist four identical subunits. enzyme completely dependent glucose 6-phosphate activity, saturation curve activation glucose 6-phosphate sigmoidal. presence 0.5 mM glucose 6-phosphate, saturation curves substrates phosphoenolpyruvate ADP hyperbolic, Km values 0.22 0.39 mM, respectively. GDP, IDP, UDP could replace ADP, Km GDP (0.026 mM) 0.067 ADP. enzyme required divalent cations, Mg2+ Mn2+, also monovalent cations, K+ NH4+, activity, strongly inhibited Pi. concentration Pi increased, half-saturating concentration Hill coefficient glucose 6-phosphate increased. However, enzyme immediately inactivated solution without Pi. intracellular concentration glucose 6-phosphate, cooperation Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity S. mutans.
