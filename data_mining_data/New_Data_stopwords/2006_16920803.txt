 Oxidative stress cardiac arrest may inactivate myocardial enzymes thereby exacerbate ischemic derangements myocardial metabolism. study examined impact cardiac arrest left ventricular enzymes. Beagles subjected 5 min cardiac arrest 5 min open-chest cardiac compressions (OCCC) epicardial direct current countershocks applied restore sinus rhythm. Glutathione/glutathione disulfide redox state (GSH/GSSG) panel enzyme activities measured snap-frozen left ventricle. test whether oxidative stress arrest inactivated enzymes, metabolic (pyruvate) pharmacological (N-acetyl-l-cysteine) antioxidants infused intravenously 30 min arrest. cardiac arrest, activities phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase, aconitase, malate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase fell 56, 81, 55, 34, 42, 55, 45%, respectively, coincident 50% decline GSH/GSSG. OCCC effected full recovery glutathione reductase partial recovery citrate synthase aconitase, parallel GSH/GSSG. Phosphofructokinase, malate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase recovered cardioversion. Antioxidant pretreatments augmented phosphofructokinase, aconitase, malate dehydrogenase activities arrest enhanced activities, well citrate synthase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, arrest. conclusion, cardiac arrest reversibly inactivates several important myocardial metabolic enzymes. Antioxidant protection enzymes implicates oxidative stress principal mechanism enzyme inactivation arrest.
