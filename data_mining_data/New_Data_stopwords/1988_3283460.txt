 myocardial oxidation fatty acids glucose, predominant substrates aerobic metabolism, impaired cardioplegic arrest coronary revascularization. lactate readily metabolized pyruvate, may preferred substrate aerobic metabolism cardioplegic arrest arterial concentrations elevated. Nineteen patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization blood cardioplegia randomized receive LOW (nine patients, exogenous lactate) HIGH (10 patients, perioperative infusion Ringer's lactate) arterial lactate concentrations. Coronary sinus catheterization lactate labeled carbon 14 permitted calculation myocardial oxygen consumption lactate oxidation significantly increased reperfusion group HIGH arterial lactate concentrations. Atrial pacing 110 beats/min cardiopulmonary bypass resulted myocardial lactate production (suggesting ischemic anaerobic metabolism) LOW lactate group, atrial pacing increased lactate consumption oxidation HIGH lactate group (suggesting increased aerobic metabolism). Systolic function (the relation end-systolic pressure volume) assessed nuclear ventriculography 3 hours postoperatively significantly better (p less 0.05 analysis covariance) HIGH lactate group. Postoperative myocardial creatine kinase release significantly lower HIGH lactate group, suggested less perioperative ischemic injury. Lactate preferred substrate myocardial oxidative metabolism cardioplegic arrest, higher arterial lactate concentrations improved myocardial metabolic functional recovery reduced perioperative ischemic injury.
