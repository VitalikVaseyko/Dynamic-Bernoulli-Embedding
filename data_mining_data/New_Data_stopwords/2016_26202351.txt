 BACKGROUND: Hemangiomas common vascular endothelial cell tumors. Abnormally activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway one important biological characteristics Hemangioma. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1(PDK1), upstream protein Akt, regulates activity Akt downstream kinases. objective study explore effect PDK1 malignant vascular tumors cell signaling mechanism mice. METHODS: Mouse Hemangioendothelioma Endothelial Cells (EOMA cells) Nu/Nu mice used. silencing PDK1 mediated lentiviral shRNA. Western blotting, WST-1 proliferation assay, Matrigel invasion assay, Xenograft vascular tumor model utilized examine effects mechanism PDK1 growth, proliferation, invasion Hemangioma. RESULTS: PDK1 deficiency significantly reduced proliferation invasion EOMA cells vitro, depressed growth vascular tumor vivo decreasing activity Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: hypothesize PDK1 plays significant role progression growth vascular tumors targeting PDK1 may thus considered treatment.
