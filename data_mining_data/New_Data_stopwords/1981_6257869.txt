 effects variation quality quantity dietary protein certain tissue enzymes rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) examined. Trout given 9 weeks diets containing proteins different quality (fish-meal, casein corn gluten) protein energy levels ranging 26 74% total metabolizable energy. first experiment, activities number enzymes monitored hepatic serine pyruvate transaminase (SPT) activity changed response dietary treatments--increasing protein energy level raised. second experiment, opposing glycolytic gluconeogenic enzyme activities [pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK); phosphofructokinase (PFK) fructose diphosphatase (FDP)] measured. Gluconeogenic enzyme activities correlated positively significantly dietary protein energy level; glycolytic enzymes correlated negatively significantly parameter three proteins. consistent relationship presumed equilibrium point opposing enzyme activities maximum weight gain three proteins. suggested hepatic activities SPT, PFK, PK, FDP PEPCK provide useful indices protein status trout.
