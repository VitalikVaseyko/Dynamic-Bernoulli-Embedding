 revised preparation pyruvate kinase saccharomyces cerevisiae reported. purifying cold-labile enzyme room temperature, improved recovery specific activity obtained. 350 mg pure enzyme specific activity 350 400 units/mg 30 degrees obtained pound fresh yeast. last step preparation, passage enzyme Sephadex G-100, required remove contaminating protease. molecular parameters new preparation are: molecular weight, 209,000; four subunits identical size; E 280 nm, 0.51; pI 6.6; pH optimum, 6.28. Kinetic parameters are: Km P-enolpyruvate ADP, 0.09 0.18 mM presence saturating Fru-1,6-P2, 1.8 0.34 mM absence Fru-1,6-P2; Ka Fru-1,6-P2, 0.014 mM. free NH2-terminal amino acid could detected. Amino acid composition determined compared pyruvate kinase preparations.
