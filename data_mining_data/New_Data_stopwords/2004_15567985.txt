 BACKGROUND: shown earlier women living polluted environment, proportion hypotrophic newborns greater general population. placentas women show significant histological changes. authors decided check whether activity pyruvate kinase (PK), key enzyme third stage glycolysis, changes similarly. MATERIAL/METHODS: study conducted placentas collected women lived polluted environment (Groups II) inhabited unpolluted area (Group III) pregnant. RESULTS: Total PK activity specific activities isoenzymes measured according Bucher Pfleiderer method. isolation PK isoenzymes carried following previously described procedure. Total PK activity lower placentas women Groups II Group III. presence two PK isoenzymes, M2 L, demonstrated. M2 L isoenzymes placentas Groups II lower specific activity Group III. one form M2 isoenzyme L dephospho-isoenzyme placentas Groups II observed, placentas Group III women forms M2 isoenzyme L phospho-isoenzyme noted. CONCLUSIONS: possible presence two PK isoenzymes placenta ensures production sufficient amount pyruvate.
