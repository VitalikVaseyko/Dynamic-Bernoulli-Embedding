 Pyruvate inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity mitochondria adipose tissue, heart, brain kidney fed rats. Starvation 24 h led increased kinase activity mitochondria adipose tissue heart brain kidney reduction pyruvate inhibition enzyme adipose tissue, heart brain. Insulin injection starved animals rapidly restored pyruvate inhibition without alteration kinase activity adipose tissue heart mitochondria. Induction streptozotocin diabetes resulted loss pyruvate inhibition kinase heart mitochondria 48 h 24 h whereas significant increase kinase activity seen 24 h. concluded mechanisms control fluctuations pyruvate sensitivity kinase different mechanisms control fluctuations uninhibited kinase activity.
