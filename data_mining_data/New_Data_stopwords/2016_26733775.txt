 present data clinical department's experience chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) regarding diagnostic utility 1 2 long contiguous stretches homozygosity (LCSHs) outbred population. study group consisted 2,110 consecutive patients 2011 2014 CMA performed. minimum cut-off size defining homozygous stretch 5 Mb. focus cases parental consanguinity, studied patients total length homozygous stretches exceed 28 Mb 1% autosomal genome length. identified 6 chromosomal regions homozygous stretches appeared least 3 patients excluded analysis. 2 120 patients isolated finding 1 2 non-recurrent LCSHs, plausible candidate gene associated phenotype identified within homozygous stretch. cases, pathogenic mutation detected, leading diagnoses pyruvate kinase deficiency Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. clarify whether previously found homozygous stretches could important interpretation genome-wide sequencing data, report 7 cases homozygous stretches encompassing clinically associated gene first found CMA, followed diagnostic whole-exome sequencing. diagnostic utility single LCSHs, unlikely caused uniparental disomy, discussed detail.
