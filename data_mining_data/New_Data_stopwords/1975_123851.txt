 metabolic activity red cell glycolytic pathway hexose monophosphate shunt (HMP) dependent glutathione system studied patients hyperthyroidism (n = 10), hyperlipoproteinemia (n = 16), hypoglycemia (n = 25) hyperglycemia (n = 23). uncontrolled diabetics patients hyperthyroidism mean value glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), glutathione reductase (GR) increased, whereas enzyme activities reduced patients hypoglycemia. Apart values hexokinase (HK) lower normal results hyperlipoproteinemia patients remained essentially unchanged, including intermediates 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduced glutathione (GSH). increased rates 2,3-DPG ATP hypoglycemia patients obtained, substrates markedly reduced diabetics.
