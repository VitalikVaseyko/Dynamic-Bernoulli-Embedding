 Genetic factors responsible development human brain. Certain genetic factors known increase risk common brain disorders affect brain structure. Therefore, even healthy people, factors role development specific brain regions. Loss-of-function mutations RAB18 gene (RAB18) cause Warburg Micro syndrome, associated reduced brain size deformed brain structures. study, hypothesized RAB18 variant might influence regional brain volumes healthy people. study participants comprised 246 normal volunteers 21 59 years age (mean age 37.8 +/- 12.0 years; 115 men, 131 women). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) genotypes RAB18 rs3765133 examined participant. differences regional brain volumes homozygotes A-allele carriers tested using voxel-based morphometry. results showed RAB18 rs3765133 homozygote group exhibited larger gray matter (GM) volume left middle temporal inferior frontal gyrus cerebrum A-allele carriers. opposite effect observed posterior lobes right tonsil cerebellum, GM volume RAB18 rs3765133 homozygotes smaller A-allele carriers (all P FWE < 0.05). findings suggest RAB18 rs3765133 polymorphism affects deve-lopment specific brain regions, particularly cerebellum, healthy people.
