 determine variations growth, key enzyme activities glucose kinase (GK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), isocitrate lyase (ICL) besides metabolite levels pyruvate antibiotic production newly isolated Streptomyces sp. M3004 grown culture media contain 10-20 g/l concentration either glucose glycerol carbon source. Biomass intracellular glucose glycerol levels Streptomyces sp. M3004 showed positive correlation concentration carbon sources, levels higher glucose compared glycerol-supplemented mediums. GK, G6PDH, KGDH activities showed marked correlation concentration glucose glycerol, activity levels 4.14-, 1.47-, 1.27-fold higher glucose glycerol. key enzyme glyoxalate cycle, ICL activities decreased increasing glucose concentrations 10 20 g/l, increased 15 g/l glycerol. positive correlations also determined intracellular glucose glycerol levels besides pyruvate protein variations respect concentrations carbon sources. Antibacterial activities Streptomyces sp. M3004 reached maximum stationary phase, change significantly respect glucose glycerol.
