 Previous studies shown PDK2 ABCG2 genes play important roles many aspects gout development European populations. However, detailed genotype-phenotype analysis performed. aim present study investigate potential association variants two genes metabolism-related quantitative phenotypes relevant gout Chinese Tibetan population. total, 316 Chinese Tibetan gout patients recruited rheumatology outpatient clinics 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms PDK2 ABCG2 genotyped, possible etiologic variants identified HapMap Chinese Han Beijing population. significant difference blood glucose levels detected different genotypes rs2728109 (P = 0.005) PDK2 gene. also detected significant difference mean serum uric levels different genotypes rs3114018 (P = 0.004) ABCG2 gene. P values remained significant Bonferroni's correction multiple testing. data demonstrate potential roles PDK2 ABCG2 polymorphisms metabolic phenotypes Tibetan gout patients, may provide new insights etiology gout. studies required confirm findings.
