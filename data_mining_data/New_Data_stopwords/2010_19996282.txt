 Dendritic cell (DC) function negatively affected tumors tumor-derived factors, little known underlying mechanisms. Here, show intracellular SOCS3 DCs binds pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK), plays critical role ATP production glycolysis. interaction SOCS3 M2-PK reduced ATP production impaired DC-based immunotherapy tumors. Thus, SOCS3, shown upregulated tumor-derived factors, interacts M2-PK decrease ATP production, causing DC dysfunction. dysfunctional DCs reduced ability present antigens. Alteration DC metabolism mediated SOCS3 represents novel mechanism DC dysfunction tumor microenvironment.
