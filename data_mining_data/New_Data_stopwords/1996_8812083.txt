 current study undertaken investigate energy metabolism hypoxia cold livers euthermic hibernating Columbian ground squirrels. hypothesized hibernating Columbian ground squirrel would able maintain liver energetics considerably longer time euthermic animals. Particular reference made function glycolysis, mechanism energy production hypothermic ischemia. transition aerobic anaerobic metabolism apparent euthermic hibernating animals lactate levels rose within 1-3 h; total lactate accumulation 2.5 micromol/g groups. euthermic squirrels, liver ATP ADP decreased considerably first 3-h storage; values dropped 55% 34%, respectively. Conversely, drain high energy phosphate pools progressed, increase low energy adenylate, AMP. 10 24 h storage, increases AMP accounted approximately 25-30% total ATP + ADP decrease. remainder drop adenylates accounted considerable decreases total adenylate (TA) contents; 24 h TA contents decreased 2.0 micromol/g. Livers hibernating squirrels exhibited similar patterns adenylate change significantly higher euthermic counterparts. respect regulatory control glycolysis, livers euthermic squirrels exhibited regulatory control phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK). Livers hibernating animals, however, showed activation PFK 10 h cold storage; levels hexose phosphates, glucose-6-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate (G6P + F6P), dropped fructose 1, 6-biphosphate (F1,6P2), increased. Changes metabolite levels (phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate) associated another key suspect regulatory enzyme, PK, indicated role regulatory control glycolysis 24-h period. apparent increase PFK responsiveness declining energy stores may futile activation since accompanying increase anaerobic end product, lactate, maintenance energetics.
