 Antineuronal antibodies (ANAs) implicated pathophysiology postinfectious movement disorders, Sydenham's chorea. However, relevance movement disorders--in absence infectious triggers--remains much disputed. sought assess frequency ANAs idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) explore whether specific phenotype associated presence ANAs. purpose, recruited 76 IPD patients, 9 patients genetic parkinsonism, 10 one parkinson-plus syndromes. subjected comprehensive clinical review. addition, 50 patients non-extrapyramidal neurological disease 30 healthy blood donors served control populations. Blood samples tested presence ANAs Western blotting, using recombinant proteins three putative antigens (aldolase C, neuron-specific enolase, pyruvate kinase M1). found antibodies 11.8% 76 IPD patients, differed significantly healthy controls (0%, P = 0.043), nonsignificantly patients genetic parkinsonism (11.1%), parkinson-plus syndrome (10%), neurological disease controls (4%). respect relevant disease characteristics, IPD patients without ANAs indistinguishable, except atypical disease features (mainly early falls freezing marked Pisa syndrome), frequent ANA-positive IPD group. conclude ANAs play role majority patients IPD, might relevant pathogenesis IPD atypical features.
