 Alzheimer's disease (AD) age-related devastating neurodegenerative disorder, severely impacts global economic development healthcare system. Though AD studied 100 years since 1906, exact cause(s) pathogenic mechanism(s) remain clarified. Also, efficient disease-modifying treatment ideal diagnostic method AD unavailable. Perturbed cerebral glucose metabolism, invariant pathophysiological feature AD, may critical contributor pathogenesis disease. review, firstly discussed features cerebral glucose metabolism physiological pathological conditions. Then, reviewed contribution glucose transportation abnormality intracellular glucose catabolism dysfunction AD pathophysiology, proposed hypothesis multiple pathogenic cascades induced impaired cerebral glucose metabolism could result neuronal degeneration consequently cognitive deficits AD patients. Among pathogenic processes, altered functional status thiamine metabolism brain insulin resistance highly emphasized characterized major pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, considering fact AD patients exhibit cerebral glucose hypometabolism possibly due impairments insulin signaling altered thiamine metabolism, also discuss potential possibilities uncover diagnostic biomarkers AD abnormal glucose metabolism develop drugs targeting repairing insulin signaling impairment correcting thiamine metabolism abnormality. conclude glucose metabolism abnormality plays critical role AD pathophysiological alterations induction multiple pathogenic factors oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, forth. clarify causes, pathogeneses consequences cerebral hypometabolism AD help break bottleneck current AD study finding ideal diagnostic biomarker disease-modifying therapy.
