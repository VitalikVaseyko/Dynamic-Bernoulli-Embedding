 identified family comprising mother two children idiopathic profound obesity body mass index (BMI) 41-49 kg/m(2). three family members carry balanced reciprocal chromosome translocation t(4;15). present clinical features affected individuals well physical mapping cloning chromosomal breakpoints. detailed characterisation chromosomal breakpoints chromosomes 4 15 revealed translocation almost perfectly balanced short insertion/deletion. chromosome 15 breakpoint positioned intron 1 RAR-related orphan receptor isoform 1 (RORa1) chromosome 4 breakpoint positioned 133 kb telomeric transcriptional start unc-5 homolog B (UNC5C) 154 kb centromeric transcriptional start pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) alpha 2 (PDHA2). rearrangement creates fusion gene, includes RORa1 exon 1 UNC5C expressed frame adipocytes affected patients. also show transcript translated protein. previous reports, shown RORa1 implicated regulation adipogenesis lipoprotein metabolism. hypothesise obesity family caused (i) haploinsufficiency RORa1 or, (ii) gain function mechanism mediated RORa1-UNC5C fusion gene.
