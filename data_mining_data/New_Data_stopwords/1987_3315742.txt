 E. coli cells harbouring recombinant plasmid pDB222 6-HDNO gene control tac-promotor induced IPTG synthesize high amount 6-HDNO protein. Part protein present 6-HDNO apoenzyme. proportion 6-HDNO apoenzyme formed could increased induction 6-HDNO synthesis IPTG performed presence inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium. 6-HDNO apoenzyme thus formed could transformed enzymatically active holoenzyme presence FAD process requiring energy-generating system consisting ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. finding suggests enzymatic step(s) (are) involved covalent flavinylation 6-HDNO.
