 1. properties pyruvate kinase and, present, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase muscles sea anemone, scallop, oyster, crab, lobster frog investigated. 2. general, properties pyruvate kinase muscles similar, except enzyme oyster (adductor muscle); pH optima 7.1 7.4, whereas oyster 8.2; fructose bisphosphate lowered optimum pH oyster enzyme 8.2 7.1, effect enzymes muscles. Hill coefficients effect concentration phosphoenolpyruvate close unity absence added alanine enzymes muscles except oyster adductor muscle; 1.5 enzyme. Alanine inhibited enzyme muscles except frog; inhibition relieved fructose bisphosphate. Low concentrations alanine effective enzyme oyster (50% inhibition observed 0.4mm). Fructose bisphosphate activated enzyme muscles, extremely low concentrations effective oyster enzyme (0.13mum produced 50% activation). 3. general, properties phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase sea anemone oyster muscles similar: K(m) values phosphoenolpyruvate low (0.10 0.13mm); enzymes require Mn(2+) addition Mg(2+) activity; ITP inhibits enzymes inhibition relieved alanine. latter compounds effect enzymes muscles. 4. suggested changes concentrations fructose bisphosphate, alanine ITP produce coordinated mechanism control activities pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase sea anemone oyster muscles, ensures phosphoenolpyruvate converted oxaloacetate succinate muscles anaerobic conditions. 5. suggested muscles crab, lobster frog, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyses conversion oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate. may part pathway oxidation amino acids muscles.
