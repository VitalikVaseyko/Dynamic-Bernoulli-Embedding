 OBJECTIVE: liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) ligand-dependent nuclear receptor major regulator reverse cholesterol transport macrophages. makes interesting target mechanistic study treatment atherosclerosis. METHODS RESULTS: optimized promising stilbenoid structure (STX4) order reach nanomolar effective concentrations LXRalpha reporter-gene assays. STX4 displayed unique property activate LXRalpha effectively subtype LXRbeta. potential STX4 increase transcriptional activity LXRalpha ligand tested gene expression analyses THP1-derived human macrophages oxLDL-loaded human foam cells. foam cells macrophage cells STX4 treatment showed athero-protective effects similar potency synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 (T09). Surprisingly, combinatorial treatment STX4 T09 resulted additive effect reporter-gene activation target gene expression. physiological tests cellular content total esterified cholesterol significantly reduced STX4 without undesirable increase triglyceride levels observed T09. CONCLUSIONS: STX4 new LXRalpha-ligand study transcriptional regulation anti-atherogenic processes cell ex vivo models, provides promising lead structure pharmaceutical development.
