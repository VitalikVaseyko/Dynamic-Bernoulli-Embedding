 BACKGROUND: Nucleoside 5'-triphosphates (NTPs) play important role cells transfer phosphate groups bioenergy. vivo, ready produced, regenerated consumed different kinds metabolic pathways, concentrations strictly controlled. NTPs useful reagents take part many biosynthetic processes. However, NTPs expensive unstable, greatly increases cost final product large amount NTPs used directly biosynthesis. Furthermore, reactions, NTPs degrade NDPs need separated reaction mixture, making operation complicated. Therefore, NTPs normally regenerated NDPs, NTPs used reaction. METHOD: Mechanisms NTP regeneration analysed, applications biosynthesis nucleotides derivates described. Basically, NTP regeneration involves isolated enzyme systems whole-cell systems. RESULT: one type cofactor regeneration, NTPs effectively regenerated acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, polyphosphate kinase acetyl phosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate, polyphosphate, respectively, whole cells yeast Corynebacterium ammoniagenes simple carbohydrates phosphate. NTP-regeneration method selected primarily due main reaction coupled with. cost phosphate donors convenience integration main process considered. CONCLUSION: Significant advances made NTP regeneration coupled biosynthetic processes, especially preparation nucleotides, 2'-deoxynucleotides, sugar-nucleotides derivatives.
