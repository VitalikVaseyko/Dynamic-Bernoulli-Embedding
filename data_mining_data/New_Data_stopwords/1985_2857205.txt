 Tubular cells isolated, characterized cultured 70 adult cadaver kidneys (postmortem time less equal 12 hr.). Confluent monolayers observed 7 days seeding (10(6) cells/ml.) cells demonstrating normal human karyotypes passaged 6 times. Primary isolates monolayer cultures negative Factor VIII activity, strongly positive gamma-glutamyltransferase activity keratin. Ultrastructurally primary isolates consisted cells numerous mitochondria, microvilli, cytoplasmic filaments well-developed endocytotic apparati. Monolayer cultures examined 7, 14, 21 72 days demonstrated less prominent microvilli additional structures desmosomes cell junctions. Membrane-associated cytosolic enzyme activities measured 28 days culture. membrane-associated enzymes gamma-glutamyltransferase alkaline phosphatase exhibited approximately 10-fold decreases activity 1st 7 days culture. approximately 5-fold increase pyruvate kinase activity time period, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity exhibited 5-fold decrease. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity change 28 day culture period examined. 7 28 days changes noted enzyme activities measured. Decreased membrane-associated enzyme activity corresponded ultrastructural observation less prominent microvilli. Increases glycolytic enzyme activity decreases gluconeogenic enzyme activity may reflect presence glucose culture medium. morphologic biochemical evidence suggests primary isolates cultures proximal tubule cells provide well-defined vitro human system future studies.
