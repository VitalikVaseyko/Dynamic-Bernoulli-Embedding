 determine whether change energy metabolism guinea-pig alveolar macrophages (AM) would alter function resemble peritoneal macrophages (PM), exposed strict anaerobic environments 96 h. Exposure cultivated hypoxic conditions resulted decreased activity cytochrome oxidase, key enzyme oxidative phosphorylation, whereas pyruvate kinase activity, key enzyme glycolysis, increased levels observed PM. hypoxic conditions total mitochondrial structure available respiratory activity also decreased glycolytic energy-dependent AM. Accompanying shift energy metabolism, adaptive changes functional responses lectin-receptor activity occurred exposed hypoxic conditions. Culture anaerobic environment led loss ability mobilize lectin receptors response cytochalasin B, whereas maintained aerobic environment could mobilize receptors response either cytochalasin B D. Alterations O2 tension affect metabolism, morphology function indicate able change energy metabolism according environmental circumstances.
