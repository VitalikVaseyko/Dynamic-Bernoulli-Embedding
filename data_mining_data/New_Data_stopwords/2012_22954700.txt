 Cancer cells convert glucose preferentially lactate even presence oxygen (aerobic glycolysis-Warburg effect). New concepts cancer treatment aim inhibition aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate acetylCoA thus preventing lactate formation. Therefore, aim study evaluate compounds could activate pyruvate dehydrogenase cancer cells. investigated effects (R)-(+)-alpha-lipoic acid (LPA) dichloroacetate (DCA), possible activators pyruvate dehydrogenase, suppression aerobic glycolysis induction cell death. neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly, SK-N-SH, Neuro-2a breast cancer cell line SkBr3 incubated different concentrations (0.1-30 mM) LPA DCA. effects compounds cell viability/proliferation (WST-1 assay), [18F]-FDG uptake, lactate production induction apoptosis (flow cytometric detection caspase-3) evaluated. Furthermore, NMRI nu/nu mice inoculated s.c. SkBr3 cells treated daily four weeks LPA (i.p, 18.5 mg/kg) starting day 7 p.i.. Tumor development measured sliding caliper monitored via [18F]-FDG-PET. Residual tumors therapy examined histopathologically. data suggests LPA reduce (1) cell viability/proliferation, (2) uptake [18F]-FDG (3) lactate production increase apoptosis investigated cell lines. contrast, DCA almost ineffective. mouse xenograft model s.c. SkBr3 cells, daily treatment LPA retarded tumor progression. Therefore, LPA seems promising compound cancer treatment.
