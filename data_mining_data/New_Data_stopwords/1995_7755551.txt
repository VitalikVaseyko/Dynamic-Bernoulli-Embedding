 Hepatic expression liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene induced transcriptional level increased carbohydrate metabolism rat. carbohydrate response L-PK gene requires sequences -171 -124, encompass adjacent major late transcription factor (MLTF)-like hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4 binding sites. Neither site alone capable conferring response, prompting us explore mechanism synergy MLTF-like factor HNF-4. Spacing requirements two factor binding sites tested generating series mutations altered distance sites. Surprisingly, constructs spacing mutations capable responding elevated glucose introduced primary hepatocytes. Thus glucose response depend rigid phasing MLTF-like HNF-4 factors, suggesting factors binding two sites interact directly other. Substitution inversion PK HNF-4 site abrogated response glucose also significantly suppressed promoter activity non-inducing conditions. conclude MLTF-like factor HNF-4 co-operate functionally maintain basal activity, well carbohydrate responsiveness, L-PK gene. mechanism co-operative DNA binding responsible synergism.
