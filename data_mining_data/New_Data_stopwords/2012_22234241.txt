 Aging drives large systemic reductions oxidative mitochondrial function, shifting entire body metabolically towards aerobic glycolysis, a.k.a, Warburg effect. Aging also one significant risk factors development human cancers, including breast tumors. two findings connected? One simplistic idea cancer cells rebel aging process increasing capacity oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS). Then, local systemic aerobic glycolysis aging host would provide energy-rich mitochondrial fuels (such L-lactate ketones) directly "fuel" tumor cell growth metastasis. would establish type parasite-host relationship "two-compartment tumor metabolism", glycolytic/oxidative metabolic-coupling. cancer cells ("the seeds") would flourish nutrient-rich microenvironment ("the soil"), fertilized host aging. scenario, cancer cells trying save consequences aging, engineering metabolic mutiny, amplification mitochondrial metabolism. discuss recent findings Drs. Ron DePinho (MD Anderson) Craig Thomspson (Sloan-Kettering) also consistent new hypothesis, linking cancer progression metabolic aging. Using data mining bioinformatics approaches, also provide key evidence role PGC1a/NRF1 signaling pathogenesis (1) two-compartment tumor metabolism, (2) mitochondrial biogenesis human breast cancer cells.
