 Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) key enzyme regulate aerobic glycolysis tumor cells used potential target cancer therapy. Here, investigated effect knockdown PKM2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) responses ionizing radiation. results showed PKM2 greatly up-regulated radioresistant cell lines PKM2 knockdown leaded increased radiosensitivity radioresistant cell lines, associated higher apoptosis rate endoplasmic reticulum stress according western blot analysis. Moreover, significant inhibition tumor size regular radiotherapy found Balb/c-nude mice bearing radioresistant NSCLC tumors PKM2 knockdown. findings suggested targeting PKM2 could effectively improve efficacy radiotherapy.
