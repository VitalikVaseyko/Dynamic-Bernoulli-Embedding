 present study conducted examine effects cysteamine culture medium progression meiosis, glutathione (GSH) content, kinase activities (histone H1 kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase), male pronuclear formation vitro insemination cumulus-denuded oocytes (DOs) pig. DOs, obtained mechanically removing cells cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) small-bore pipette, cultured 45 h TCM199 supplemented sodium pyruvate, gonadotropins, estradiol, 10% porcine follicular fluid, without cysteamine (150 microM). Maturation rates DOs cultured without cysteamine different (60-70%) significantly lower COCs (90-100%) (p < 0.05). GSH content matured DOs cultured cysteamine significantly higher DOs cultured without cysteamine (p < 0.05). Values types kinase activity matured DOs cultured without cysteamine different (p > 0.05). vitro insemination, DOs cultured cysteamine showed significantly higher rates male pronuclear formation (80.3 +/- 3.0%) DOs cultured without cysteamine (16.4 +/- 0.5%) (p < 0.05). results indicate addition cysteamine culture medium increased oocyte GSH content promoted male pronuclear formation sperm penetration porcine DOs effects maturation rates kinase activities.
