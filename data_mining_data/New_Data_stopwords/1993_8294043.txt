 complete nucleotide (nt) sequence PEPCK gene encoding Trypanosoma cruzi phospho-enol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; ATP dependent, EC 4.1.1.49) determined. predicted primary sequence 473 amino acids (aa) calculated molecular mass 52.5 kDa. ubiquitous spliced leader present nt position -60 AUG start codon PEPCK mRNA; coding region followed long 3'-non-coding region 777 nt. Northern Southern blot analysis showed PEPCK mRNA 2.7 kb long PEPCK gene polymorphic T. cruzi, one copy genome epimastigote form. Comparison available aa sequences ATP(protozoa, yeast bacteria)- GTP(vertebrates, insects, helminths fungi)-dependent PEPCKs showed former lack two characteristic, highly conserved regions present GTP-dependent enzymes: one associated binding PEP second frequently labeled 'catalytic' contains conserved Cys residue unusual reactivity. hand, two consensus sequences conserved predicted secondary structure identified PEPCKs, independent nt specificity; one divalent metal-binding site previously identified pyruvate kinase X-ray crystallographic studies.
