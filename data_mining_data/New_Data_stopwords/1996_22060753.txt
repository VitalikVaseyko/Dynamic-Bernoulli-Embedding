 fast breakdown glycogen observed muscles stress-susceptible pigs leading pale, soft exudative (PSE) meat. report comparative study pyruvate kinase muscles normal PSE-prone pigs. Compared enzyme normal muscle, pyruvate kinase isolated PSE-muscle shows five times lower K(m) phosphoenol pyruvate ten times higher k (cat)K (m) value. pH-dependency enzymatic activity shifted acidic values pyruvate kinase PSE muscles. According isoelectric focusing, pyruvate kinase PSE muscle consists three isoforms, two isoforms detectable pyruvate kinase preparations normal pigs. various isoforms isolated preparative isoelectric focusing steady-state properties compared. Isoform 3, found PSE muscle, shows 10-fold higher specific activity, 30-fold lower K(m) value 100-fold increased k (cat)K (m) value phosphoenol pyruvate compared isoform 1. presence isoform 3 PSE-muscle appears responsible high activity enzyme acidic conditions prevailing PSE-muscle. vitro phosphorylation dephosphorylation experiments using total enzyme purified isoenzyme 1 suggest isoforms 2 3 arise isoform 1 phosphorylation. Thus protein phosphorylation seems responsible shift activity pyruvate kinase, key enzyme glycolysis, acidic conditions PSE-muscles.
