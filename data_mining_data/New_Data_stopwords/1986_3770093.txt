 Intact rat fat cells exposed 12.5 microM [gamma-32P]ATP incorporate label specific proteins within minutes. solubilizing reaction mixture SDS passes subcellular fractionation steps, labeled proteins identified autoradiographs SDS-PAGE gels. prominently labeled protein Mr 42,000. Localization component cell surface made basis inhibition phosphorylation addition protein derived rat brain protein kinase inhibitory property, susceptibility phosphorylated protein tryptic digestion, whereas unphosphorylated protein unaffected digestion trypsin (15 min), inhibition phosphorylation protein brief exposure melittin, consistent observation label associated 42,000 Mr band homogenates permeabilized cells comparable numbers intact cells exposed amount label. 42,000 Mr phosphoprotein also present mitochondria likely alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase. rule possibility cell surface protein might mitochondrial contaminant broken cells, 32Pi-labeled [gamma-32P]ATP-labeled cells solubilized Triton chromatographed rabbit anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase antibody-Sepharose 4B column. single labeled peak detected upon elution bound fraction 32Pi-labeled sample, [gamma-32P]ATP-labeled sample. Subcellular fractionation studies intact cells labeled [gamma-32P]ATP showed differences recovery phosphoproteins 42,000 Mr depending whether continuous sucrose gradient (27.6-54.1%, g/ml) discontinuous sucrose gradient (16, 35 48%, g/ml) used. Phosphoproteins 42,000 Mr located mitochondrial membrane fractions collected discontinuous sucrose gradient separation, whereas phosphoprotein 42,000 Mr found primarily mitochondrial fraction continuous sucrose gradient separation. 5'-nucleotidase activity measurements, latter approach appears result isolation heavy fragment plasma membrane mitochondrial light fraction 42,000 Mr labeled. Finally, comparison autoradiographs two-dimensional (2D) gels (isoelectric focusing followed 10% SDS-PAGE) show different isoelectric points 42,000 Mr components [gamma-32P]ATP- 32Pi-labeled cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
