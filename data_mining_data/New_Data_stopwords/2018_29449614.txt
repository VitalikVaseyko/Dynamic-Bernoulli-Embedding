 Changes TCA cycle enzymes respiratory activity possible mechanisms aerobic glycolysis contributes tumor progression. clarify whether decrease succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) alters energy metabolism, induces Warburg effect results tumor malignancy, SDHB expression examined modulated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues cells, respectively. SDHB level often decreased malignant HCC cells tissues. Furthermore, reduced SDHB expression associated advanced tumor stage poor survival rate. Moreover, silencing SDHB altered energy metabolism switched aerobic respiration glycolysis, resulted Warburg effect, enhanced cell proliferation motility. contrast, SDHB overexpression deregulated bioenergetic metabolism decreased cell growth migration. mouse xenograft models, subcutaneous implantation tail vein injection SDHB knockdown cells resulted larger tumor volume accelerated cancer metastasis, respectively. mutation decrease SDHB induced switch aerobic respiration glycolysis. metabolic alteration associated tumor cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, motility overall patient survival HCC.
