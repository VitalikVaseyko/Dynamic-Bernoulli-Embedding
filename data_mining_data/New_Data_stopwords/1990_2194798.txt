 Administration phalloidin vivo rats causes marked changes distribution actin myosin hepatocytes, accompanies reduced bile flow. found hepatocytes treated phalloidin 3 7 days, cellular myosin content increased 1.5-fold 4.7-fold, respectively. addition, total cell protein content several marker enzyme activities also elevated 30-120% depending duration phalloidin treatment. observations allow us speculate phalloidin somehow elicits inhibition cellular protein degradation, results increase protein levels. examine possibility further, analyzed leupeptin-induced density shift phagolysosomes. normal liver, injection leupeptin/E64c caused increase density heterolysosomes autolysosomes, due retarded digestion sequestered proteins result inhibition lysosomal cathepsins. Accumulation, denser autolysosomes, lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase, myosin demonstrated enzyme assays immunoblot analysis. phalloidin-treated liver, increase density autolysosomes accumulation cytoplasmic enzymes markedly inhibited. However, phalloidin affect shift density heterolysosomes. data, concluded autolysosome formation specifically hindered phalloidin-treated rat hepatocytes, results reduction autophagic protein degradation eventual increase intracellular protein levels.
