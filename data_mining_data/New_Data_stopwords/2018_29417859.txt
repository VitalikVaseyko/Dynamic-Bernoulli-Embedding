 Hemoglobinopathies group inherited single gene disorders. reports hemoglobin (Hb) variants identified tribal non-tribal populations Tripura State northeastern India. study aimed determine spectrum hemoglobinopathies enzymopathies newborn screening Tripura State assess extent neonatal jaundice. total 2400 cord blood samples collected analyzed high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). confirmation abnormal HPLC done DNA analysis. samples also screened deficiency enzymopathies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency pyruvate kinase. 2400 cord blood samples screened, 225 (9.3%) Hb E (HBB: c.79G>A) heterozygotes, 80 (3.3%) Hb E homozygotes one carried Hb E-beta-thalassemia (beta-thal). Hb abnormalities also detected including 15 Hb (HBB: c.20A>T) heterozygotes, two Hb D-Punjab (HBB: c.364G>C) heterozygotes two compound heterozygotes Hb D-Punjab Hb E. 80 homozygous Hb E babies, four non-tribal 76 babies tribal, 225 patients carried Hb E trait, 141 tribal, 84 non-tribal. 40 G6PD deficient babies identified, 13 coinherited Hb E two babies pyruvate kinase deficiency. alpha Genotyping performed 162 affected babies, 50 carried alpha gene deletions. Newborn screening programs Hb E, hemoglobinopathies G6PD deficiency must encouraged malaria-endemic northeastern region India. Drug-induced hemolysis also avoided screening G6PD deficiency birth.
