 Tamoxifen commonly used drug treat breast cancer acts blocking ERalpha (oestrogen receptor alpha) signalling. Although highly effective, usefulness limited development resistance. Given this, strategies limit resistance sensitizing cells tamoxifen may use clinic. gain insight might achieved, used chemical genetic screens identify targets small-molecule inhibitors cause tamoxifen sensitization. high-throughput genetic screen, using RNA interference library targeting 779 kinases related proteins, identified PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) signalling pathway strong determinant sensitivity multiple ERalpha antagonists, including tamoxifen. chemical screen using existing drugs known kinase inhibitors also identified inhibitors PDK1 pathway, including triciribine tetrandrine. Aside identifying novel agents targets tamoxifen sensitization, approach also provides evidence performing chemical genetic screens parallel may useful.
