 Glucose essential energy metabolism cells conservation glucose obligatory survival starvation. principal site glucose conservation mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, regulated reversible phosphorylation (phosphorylation inactivating). cells glucose oxidation switched starvation, fatty acids used fuel, acetyl CoA NADH formed beta-oxidation promote phosphorylation PDH complex activation PDH kinase. longer-term mechanism increases PDH kinase activity response cAMP products beta-oxidation fatty acids. Coordinated inhibition glycolytic flux mediated effects citrate PFK1 PFK2 muscles liver results associated inhibition glucose uptake. Similar mechanisms lead impaired glucose oxidation diabetes.
