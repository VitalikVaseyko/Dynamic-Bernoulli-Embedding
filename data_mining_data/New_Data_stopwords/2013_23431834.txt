 common perturbation found cells oxidative stress alteration cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. order understand effects oxidative damage, human red cell plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) studied measuring PMCA activity, presence absence calmodulin (CaM), following treatment sulfhydryl agents, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetate diamide. PMCA activity washed red cell membrane measured coupling pyruvate kinase, using phosphoenolpyruvate substrate, lactate dehydrogenase convert pyruvate lactate employing beta-NADH co-factor. treatments inhibited basal CaM-stimulated activity dose-dependent manner (0.01-1 mM), low concentrations, basal Ca(2+)-ATPase activity inhibited whereas CaM-stimulated activity unaffected. Inhibition diamide, disulfide-forming agent, reversed dithiotreitol (DTT). Treatment calpain, calcium-dependent protease, elevated basal PMCA activity CaM-stimulated level, abolished response CaM. treatment diamide inhibited PMCA activity, could restored DTT, basal CaM-stimulated level. studies indicated necessary protect sulfhydryl proteolytic damages red cell PMCA perturbation Ca2+ homeostasis minimized. implications membranes oxidative stress, hereditary anemia, thalassemia, membrane-bound unmatched hemoglobin chains cause oxidative damage red blood cells.
