 effect 6-methylprednisolone (GCC) studied erythropoietin (ESF) levels metabolic functions erythrocytes (RBC). GCC (U mg/kg/day 15 days) administered 6 patients haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (group B) 6 patients non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia due hereditary pyruvate kinase enzyme deficiency (group C). 6 healthy persons served control (group A). metabolic functions RBC investigated assaying HMPS activity, GSH/GSSG lactate/pyruvate ratios, relevant glycolytic intermediates, 2,3-DPG, ATP, key enzymes. significant increase ESF observed group B patients GCC therapy, correlating improvement haemolytic state, consequent rectification secondary disturbances RBC metabolism. Group C patients already raised ESF levels GCC therapy; increase occured response treatment clinical haematological change recorded. Hence, harmonal influence GCC disturbed RBC metabolic process detectable cases.
