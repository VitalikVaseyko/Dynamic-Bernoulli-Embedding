 activity rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) regulated metabolites. Besides requiring presence substrates, PEP ADP, enzyme requires Mg(2+) K(+) activity. PK allosterically inhibited Phe activity. presence PEP Phe opposing effects hydrodynamic properties enzyme without apparent change secondary structure. study, structural perturbation induced ligand binding investigated Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, structural dynamics PK probed H/D exchange monitored FT-IR. Substrates activating metal ions induce PK assume dynamic structure Phe exerts opposite effect. cases significant interconversion secondary structures. PEP efficient ligand inducing change microenvironments helices sheets much detected spectroscopically separate bands. results provide first evidence differential effect ligand binding dynamics structural elements PK. Furthermore, data support model allosteric regulation PK consequence perturbation distribution ensemble states observed change hydrodynamic properties represent two extreme end states.
