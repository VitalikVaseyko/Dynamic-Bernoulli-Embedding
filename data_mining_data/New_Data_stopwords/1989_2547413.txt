 ability injected Photofrin II, preparation enriched hydrophobic dihaematoporphyrin ethers esters, photosensitize selected mitochondrial cytosolic enzymes illumination vitro examined. Preparations R3230AC mammary tumours, obtained designated times single dose Photofrin II, displayed time-dependent photosensitivity. Maximum inhibition mitochondrial enzymes occurred 24 hours post-treatment, whereas inhibition cytosolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, observed 168 hour time course. selected 24 hour time point, mitochondrial enzyme photosensitisation found drug dose (5.25 mg kg-1 Photofrin II) light dose dependent, rank order inhibition cytochrome c oxidase greater F0F1 ATPase greater succinate dehydrogenase greater NADH dehydrogenase. conclude porphyrin species contained Photofrin II accumulate mitochondria tumour cells vivo produce maximum photosensitisation 24-72 hours administration tumour-bearing animals. time course observed Photofrin II similar seen previously heterogenous haematoporphyrin derivative preparation vivo-in vitro model.
