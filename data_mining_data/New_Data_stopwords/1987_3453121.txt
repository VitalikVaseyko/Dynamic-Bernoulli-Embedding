 Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) metabolic enzyme functioning Embden-Meyerhof pathway converts glucose (or fructose) pyruvate. Two functional loci production PGK identified mammalian genome. PGK-1 X-linked gene expressed constitutively somatic cells premeitotic germ cells. human PGK-1 gene consists 11 exons 10 introns encompassing region approximately 23 kilobases (kb) length. PGK-2 autosomal gene expressed tissue-specific manner exclusively late stages spermatogenesis. present study, molecular analysis human genomic clone PGK-2 originally isolated Szabo et al. revealed autosomal sequence completely lacks introns contains characteristics processed gene, 'retroposon', including remnants poly(A)+ tail bounding direct repeats. Typically processed sequences form non-functional pseudogenes evolved multiple genetic lesions preclude translation transcript functional polypeptide. example, X-linked processed pseudogene PGK-1 (psi PGK-1) humans identified shown contain premature termination codons reading frames. therefore unexpected find intronless autosomal PGK sequence reported pseudogene, rather functional gene retained complete open reading frame, actively expressed mammalian spermatogenesis. unusual conservation function processed PGK-2 gene tissue-specific expression spermatogenesis best explained compensatory response inactivation X-linked PGK-1 gene spermatogenic cells meiosis.
