 UNLABELLED: Gastric carcinoma frequent, particularly China, therapy often inefficient. cancer cells partly mainly dependent glycolysis generate adenosine triphosphate ATP (Warburg effect) and/or produce precursors (of lipid, nucleotides, etc.) building new cells, inhibition glycolysis may slow cell proliferation and/or may kill cells. antitumor effect citrate, anti-glycolytic agent inhibiting phosphofructokinase (PFK) tested two human gastric carcinoma cell lines. MATERIALS METHODS: Cell viability morphology assessed 24-72 h exposure citrate (5, 10, 220 mM). Apoptosis assessed annexin V-FITC/PI staining Western immunobloting. RESULTS: 3-day continuous exposure citrate led near destruction cell population cell lines, apoptotic cell death occurred mitochondrial pathway dose- time-dependent manner, associated reduction anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein lines. CONCLUSION: Citrate demonstrates strong cytotoxic activity two gastric cancer lines, leading early diminution expression Mcl-1 massive apoptotic cell death involving mitochondrial pathway.
