 OBJECTIVE: immediate effects oxytocin myometrial signal transduction described. However, longer term effects (up hour) myometrial proteome not. combined vitro contractility proteomic analysis determine protein changes associated oxytocin-induced myometrial activity. STUDY DESIGN: Human myometrial biopsies taken elective caesarean section prior administration oxytocics. Strips mounted organ bath exposed oxytocin (10(-8) mol/L), oxytocin antagonist L372,662 (10(-7) mol/L), vehicle (n = 5 each) 60 minutes. Contractility determined expressed percentage pretreatment strip. end contractility experiment, proteins extracted separated two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gels analyzed PDQuest proteins interest identified mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Identified proteins demonstrated differences result treatment oxytocin oxytocin receptor antagonist L372,662 Annexin-A3, Osteoglycin, HSP70-protein 2, 2 isoforms Cytokeratin 19, Desmin, EHD2, Protein disulfide isomerase A3, BIGH3, transgelin, thioredoxin reductase, triose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, elongation factor 1gamma, alpha-Actin-3. proteins grouped 5 classes protein, associated cytoskeletal function, contractile/oxidative stress, protein synthesis, extracellular matrix proteins, energy metabolism. CONCLUSION: study demonstrates oxytocin longer term (1 hour) effects myometrial proteome.
