 'Warburg effect' considered vital hallmark cancer cells, characterized altered metabolism, cells rely aerobic glycolysis. key enzyme aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) serves crucial role tumorigenesis. Accumulating studies indicated PKM2 potential target cancer therapy. aim present study assess anticancer effects LY294002, specific phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor, gastric cancer (GC) cells explore possible mechanism vitro. present study revealed LY294002 inhibited GC cell proliferation, induced early apoptosis significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity lactate production, part inhibiting PKM2 expression. summary, LY294002 exhibits anticancer effects GC, partly via downregulation PKM2.
