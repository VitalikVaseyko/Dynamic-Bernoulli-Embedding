 Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) frequently mutated gene clear cell renal carcinoma. Here, identified novel translational variant VHL, termed VHLalpha, initiated alternative translational start site upstream frame ATG start codon. showed VHLalpha interacts regulates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), consequently modulates pyruvate kinase transcript splicing reprograms cellular glucose metabolism. study demonstrated novel VHL isoform may function tumor suppressor inhibiting Warburg effect.
