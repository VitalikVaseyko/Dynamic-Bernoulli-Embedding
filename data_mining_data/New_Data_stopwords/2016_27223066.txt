 discovery Warburg effect opens new era anti-cancer therapy. Aerobic glycolysis regarded hallmark cancer cells increasing literatures indicates metabolic changes critical maintenance progression cancer cells. Besides aerobic glycolysis, increased fatty acid synthesis also required rapid growth cancer cells, considered one typical metabolic symbols cancer either. Thus, targeting fatty acid metabolism may provide potential avenue diagnosis therapeutic treatment cancer. study, identified Sterol-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) rate-limiting enzyme unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, universally highly expressed lung adenocarcinoma required cell proliferation, migration invasion. vitro vivo studies demonstrated high expression SCD1 remarkably enhanced ability tumor formation invasion, knockdown SCD1 significantly repressed tumorigenesis induced cell apoptosis. Clinical association study suggested high expression SCD1 frequently observed late stage patients presents poor prognosis. Taken together, results suggested SCD1 potentially novel biomarker lung adenocarcinoma, targeting SCD1 may represent new anti-cancer strategy.
