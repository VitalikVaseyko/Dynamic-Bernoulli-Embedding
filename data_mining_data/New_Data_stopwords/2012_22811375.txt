 Pyridoxamine supplementation caused alteration expression genes encoding six gluconeogenesis-related proteins. expression levels phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 pyridoxamine-supplemented mice higher control mice. contrast, pyridoxamine supplementation caused lower expression levels peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha, carbohydrate response element-binding protein, glucocorticoid receptor, glucose-6-phosphatase. pyridoxamine-supplemented mice showed significantly low glucose clearance glucose tolerance test, showed symptoms diabetes, estimated according levels hemoglobin A1c blood glucose. Pyruvate challenge testing suggested pyridoxamine supplementation enhanced gluconeogenic activity pyruvate. results showed high-dose pyridoxamine may require careful inquiry concerning validity.
