 Penicillium janthinellum able grow glycine sole carbon nitrogen source. amino acid transaminated glyoxylate metabolised pyruvate glycerate pathway. reaction product partially purified glycerate kinase fungus 2-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycerate mutase initiates gluconeogenesis glycine. Partially purified phosphoglycerate mutase inhibited fructose 6-phosphate. possible significance regulation discussed.
