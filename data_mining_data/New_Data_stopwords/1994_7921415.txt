 Renal oncocytomas, previously shown originate collecting duct system, induced male Sprague-Dawley rats oral administration N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM) 7 weeks. expression glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 GLUT2, several enzymes involved glucose metabolism [hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH)] studied cytochemical approaches serial cryostat sections kidney 12, 23 34 weeks withdrawal NNM. Oncocytic tubules connected collecting ducts first observed 23 weeks, oncocytomas 34 weeks withdrawal. cytochemical pattern oncocytic tubules oncocytomas similar, differed markedly normal collecting ducts nearly variables studied; expression GLUT1 hexokinase proteins strongly increased; activities HK, PK MDH elevated, LDH activity reduced. results suggest oncocytic transformation associated fundamental changes energy metabolism differ cell lineages leading types renal cell tumours, clear/acidophilic basophilic cell tumours. characteristic over-expression GLUT1 may used diagnostic criterion discrimination oncocytes acidophilic (granular) cells clear/acidophilic renal cell tumours show reduced expression glucose transporter protein.
