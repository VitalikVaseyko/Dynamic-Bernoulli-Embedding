 parameters (glycolysis, respiration, levels glycolytic enzymes) lymphoid cells Sticker's lymphosarcoma established order better define biochemical behavior venereal tumor dog. comparative purposes lymphocytes peripheral blood normal tumor-bearing dogs also studied. Lactic acid produced tumor cells aerobic glycolysis liberated reaction medium. Oxygen uptake enhanced presence succinate, pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate substrates. Higher levels enzymes glycolytic pathways well differences physicochemical kinetic properties glycolytic regulatory enzymes found Sticker's tumor cells, compared lymphocytes peripheral blood normal tumor-bearing dogs. fructose-bisphosphate positively modulated pyruvatekinase found tumor cells.
