 1. Activation glucose 6-phosphate one unique properties pyruvate kinase Mycobacterium smegmatis. 2. Pyruvate kinase, partially purified ultrasonic extracts mycobacteria (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, exhibited sigmoidal kinetics various concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, high degree co-operativity (Hill coefficient, h = 3.7) S0.5 value 1.0 mM. 3. presence glucose 6-phosphate, degree co-operativity shown phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve decreased h = 2.33 S0.5 value lowered 0.47 mM. 4. enzyme activated AMP ribose 5-phosphate also, activation constant lowest glucose 6-phosphate (0.24 mM). 5. enzyme strongly inhibited ATP phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. concentrations ATP required produce half-maximal inhibition enzyme activity non-saturating (0.2 mM) saturating (2 mM) phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations 1.1 mM 3 mM respectively. 6. inhibition ATP partially relieved glucose 6-phosphate. 7. enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics ADP variable substrate, apparent Km 0.66 mM. 8. enzyme required Mg2+ Mn2+ ions activity. activated univalent cations. 9. kinetic data indicate physiological conditions glucose 6-phosphate probably plays significant role regulation pyruvate kinase activity.
