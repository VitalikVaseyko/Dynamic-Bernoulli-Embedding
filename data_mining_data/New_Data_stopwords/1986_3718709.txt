 understand control mechanisms involved regulation fetal glycogen, studied effect utero fetal decapitations glycogen metabolism rabbit fetal heart, lung, liver. utero fetal decapitations performed days 18 21 gestation. Two four fetuses one side horn decapitated. Fetuses delivered days 23 26 days 28 30 gestation. Fetal heart, lungs, liver analyzed DNA, protein, glycogen, glycogen synthase (I forms), glycogen phosphorylase (a b forms), phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase. fetal heart lung, difference observed measurements intact decapitated fetuses. contrast, fetal liver appear develop glycogen system indicated low levels glycogen (0.02 mg/mg DNA) decapitated fetuses compared intact fetuses (0.4 mg/mg DNA). Similarly levels glycogen synthase phosphorylase two three times lower livers decapitated fetuses compared livers intact fetuses. three enzymes phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase affected fetal decapitation three tissues. results indicate fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (thyroid) axis required least day 18 gestation normal accumulation subsequent utilization glycogen fetal heart lungs, absolute requirement development fetal liver glycogen system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
