 right ventricle (RV) major determinant functional state prognosis pulmonary arterial hypertension. RV hypertrophy (RVH) triggered pressure overload initially compensatory often leads RV failure. Despite similar RV afterload mass patients develop adaptive RVH (concentric retained RV function), others develop maladaptive RVH, characterized dilatation, fibrosis, RV failure. differentiation adaptive versus maladaptive RVH imprecise, adaptive RVH associated better functional capacity survival. molecular level, maladaptive RVH displays greater impairment angiogenesis, adrenergic signaling, metabolism adaptive RVH, derangements often involve left ventricle. Clinically, maladaptive RVH characterized increased N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, troponin release, elevated catecholamine levels, RV dilatation, late gadolinium enhancement MRI, increased (18)fluorodeoxyglucose uptake positron emission tomography, QTc prolongation ECG. maladaptive RVH reduced inotrope responsiveness G-protein receptor kinase-mediated downregulation, desensitization, uncoupling beta-adrenoreceptors. RV ischemia may result capillary rarefaction decreased right coronary artery perfusion pressure. Maladaptive RVH shares metabolic abnormalities cancer including aerobic glycolysis (resulting forkhead box protein O1-mediated transcriptional upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), glutaminolysis (reflecting ischemia-induced cMyc activation). Augmentation glucose oxidation beneficial experimental RVH achieved inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, fatty acid oxidation, glutaminolysis. Therapeutic targets RV failure include chamber-specific abnormalities metabolism, angiogenesis, adrenergic signaling, phosphodiesterase-5 expression. ability restore RV function experimental models challenges dogma RV failure irreversible without regression pulmonary vascular disease.
