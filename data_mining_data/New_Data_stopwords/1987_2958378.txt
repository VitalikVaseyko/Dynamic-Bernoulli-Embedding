 Abnormal glucose lipid metabolism striated muscles arterial wall demonstrated 3 species: pig, dog, human Type 2 diabetic patients, sharing common feature peripheral hyperinsulinaemia. study eighteen consecutive patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery eight control patients examined. Prior surgery oral glucose tolerance test showed eleven eighteen patients impaired glucose tolerance significantly elevated fasting immune reactive insulin (IRI) C-peptide concentrations. statistically significant correlation 2 hour blood glucose value fasting plasma insulin level (R = 0.55, p less 0.05). operation, aortic muscle biopsies taken. eighteen patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery showed disturbances glucose metabolism, i.e. decreased activity glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase 0.30 +/- 0.06 versus 0.40 +/- 0.06 U/g, p less 0.001, phosphofructokinase 0.48 +/- 0.09 versus 0.61 +/- 0.07 U/g, p less 0.01). Malic enzyme activity increased patients (0.17 +/- 0.03 versus 0.06 +/- 0.02 U/g, p less 0.001). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased eleven patients impaired glucose tolerance (0.55 +/- 0.10 versus 0.30 +/- 0.07, p less 0.01) parallel significant increase triglyceride content aortic wall (16.1 +/- 4.8 versus 3.7 +/- 3.2 mumol/g, p less 0.01) well striated muscles (374 +/- 44 versus 48 +/- 6 mumol/g, p less 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
