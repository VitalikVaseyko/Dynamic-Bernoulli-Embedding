 Metabolic reprogramming recognized hallmark cancer. order support continued proliferation growth, tumor cells must metabolically adapt balance bioenergetic biosynthetic needs. achieve this, cancer cells switch mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation predominantly rely glycolysis, process known "Warburg effect". BRAF oncogene recently emerged critical regulator process melanoma, bringing fore importance metabolic reprogramming pathogenesis treatment metastatic melanoma. review, summarize current understanding oncogenic reprogramming metabolism BRAF NRAS mutant melanoma, highlight emerging evidence supporting metabolic basis MAPK pathway inhibitor resistance metabolic vulnerabilities may exploited overcome this.
