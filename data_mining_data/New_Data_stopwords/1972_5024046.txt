 Normal red cells incubated absence glucose develop system total adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover could assessed. 1 hr, triose pool completely consumed. Thereafter, metabolism 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) pyruvate lactate sole significant source ATP synthesis.10(-3)M CuCl(2), enter cells, diminished ATP utilization 50%. could partially attributed inhibition copper residual acylation cation pumping, already reduced glucose depletion. membrane enzymes, presumably function maintenance membrane integrity, must, therefore, use significant portion erythrocyte ATP. behavior glucose-depleted red cells respect cation transport complex. addition ouabain decrease ATP utilization red cells. Ouabain inhibitable potassium influx nearly normal triose depletion, total potassium influx decreased. contrast, ouabain inhibitable sodium efflux markedly reduced triose depletion, although concentration ATP 70% normal. dissociation monovalent cation pumping suggests energy active sodium transport derived specific source (such ATP produced phosphoglycerate kinase reaction) distinct potassium transport.
