 FA (fatty acid) recycling adipose tissue appears important pathway regulating FA release blood fasting. Re-esterification requires G3P (glycerol 3-phosphate), cannot synthesized glucose glycolysis much reduced circumstances. addition, G3P scarcely originate glycerol since glycerol kinase low activity white adipose tissue. shown 35 years ago metabolic pathway named glyceroneogenesis, allows G3P synthesis non-carbohydrate precursors like pyruvate, lactate amino acids, activated fasting. major enzyme pathway shown PEPCK-C [cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); EC 4.1.1.32]. present review analyses mechanisms series hormones nutrients affect PEPCK-C gene transcription glyceroneogenesis describes evidence dysregulation pathway type 2 diabetes.
