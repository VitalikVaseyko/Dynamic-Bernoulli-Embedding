 20 protein kinases directly activated 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), central component pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation survival. Despite importance PDK1 cell signalling, highly selective PDK1 inhibitors described. issue Biochemical Journal, Dario Alessi's group collaborators GlaxoSmithKline report GSK2334470, potent selective PDK1 inhibitor. show compound blocks phosphorylation known PDK1 substrates, surprisingly find potency kinetics inhibition vary different PDK1 targets. substrate-specific inhibition implications development PDK1 inhibitors drugs.
