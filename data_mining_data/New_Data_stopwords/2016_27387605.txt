 Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) inexpensive renewable carbon source generated gas fermentation anaerobic digestion fermentable wastes. oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica promising biocatalyst utilize VFAs convert triacylglycerides (TAGs). However, currently limited knowledge metabolism Y. lipolytica cultured VFAs. develop better understanding, used acetate sole carbon source culture two strains, control strain previously engineered strain lipid overaccumulation. strains, metabolism growth phase lipid production phase investigated metabolic flux analysis using two parallel sodium acetate tracers. resolved flux distributions demonstrate glyoxylate shunt pathway constantly active flux gluconeogenesis varies depending strain phase. particular, regulating activities malate transport pyruvate kinase, cells divert portion glyoxylate shunt flux required satisfy needs anaplerotic reactions NADPH production gluconeogenesis oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Excess flux flows back tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle energy production. case glucose substrate, primary source lipogenic NADPH derived oxidative PPP.
