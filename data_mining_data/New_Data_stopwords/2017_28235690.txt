 growing interest emerged field studying cross-talk cancer cell cycle metabolism. review, aimed present metabolism cell cycle correlated cancer cells get energy drive cell cycle. Cell proliferation cell death largely depend metabolic activity cell. Cell cycle proteins, e.g. cyclin D, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK), pro-apoptotic anti-apoptotic proteins, P53 shown regulated metabolic crosstalk. Dysregulation cross-talk metabolism cell cycle leads degenerative disorder(s) cancer. fully understood actual reason aberration metabolism cell cycle, hallmark cancer research. Herein, discussed role regulatory molecules relative cell cycle metabolism highlight control function other. also pointed out, current therapeutic opportunities additional crucial therapeutic targets fields could breakthrough cancer research.
