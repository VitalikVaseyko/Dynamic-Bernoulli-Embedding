 Hyperinsulinemia produced fetal rhesus monkeys 21 days last third gestation subcutaneous pork insulin injected 19 U day. Plasma insulin concentrations treated fetuses (N = 4) 3525 microU/ml. difference paired pre- post-treatment fetal plasma glucose concentration. Activity hepatic enzymes promote glucose utilization (glucokinase hexokinase) glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase) unaffected. Similarly, glycogen metabolism enzymes (active inactive synthase phosphorylase) unaltered. Two gluconeogenic enzymes (PEPCK glucose-6-phosphatase) diminished treated group compared controls. Fetal hyperinsulinemia enhanced lipogenic NADPH-producing enzyme activities, evidenced twofold increase fatty acid synthase citrate cleavage enzyme activity. Malic enzyme absent. Hyperinsulinemia euglycemia (1) increases activity enzymes participate lipogenesis, (2) decreases controlling gluconeogenesis, (3) effect enzymes glycolysis.
