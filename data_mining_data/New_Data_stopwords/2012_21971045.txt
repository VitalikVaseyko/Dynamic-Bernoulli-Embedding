 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase functions downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Although binding 3'-phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain PDK1 known essential interaction activation downstream kinases, mechanism PDK1 recruited plasma membrane remains controversial. surface plasmon resonance analysis PDK1 PH domain selected mutants shows PH domain specifically binds phosphatidylserine using site separate canonical phosphoinositide-binding site. cell studies show specific phosphatidylserine binding important plasma membrane localization signaling function PDK1.
