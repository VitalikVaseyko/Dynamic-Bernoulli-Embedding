 pfk gene encoding phosphofructokinase (Pfk) anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 cloned sequenced. gene identified plasmid library complementation E. coli pfk mutant ability amplify fragment PCR using primers based homologous regions Pfk microorganisms. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed coding region 319-aa protein homologous Pfks organisms. Enzyme assay ability complement growth defects E. coli pfk mutants confirmed expression clostridial pfk gene. pyruvate kinase (pyk) gene identified adjacent pfk. arrangement genes encoding key regulators glycolytic flux yet described strict anaerobe. gene arrangement found Gram-positive organisms, Gram-negative organisms.
