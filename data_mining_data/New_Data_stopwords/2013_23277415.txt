 Maple Syrup Urine Disease inborn error metabolism caused severe deficiency activity branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Neurological disorder common patients maple syrup urine disease. Although leucine considered main toxic metabolite, mechanisms underlying neuropathology brain injury poorly understood. present study, evaluated possible preventive effect co-administration creatine plus pyruvate effects elicited leucine administration female Wistar rats pregnancy lactation oxidative stress parameters well activities enzymes involved phosphoryltransfer network brain cortex hippocampus offspring 21 days age. Leucine administration induced oxidative stress altered activities pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, mitochondrial cytosolic creatine kinase. Co-administration creatine plus pyruvate partially effective prevention alterations provoked leucine administration oxidative stress enzymes phosphoryltransfer network. results suggest non-treated maternal hyperleucinemia may toxic brain offspring.
