 Glycolytic parameters determined recessive yeast mutants partial defects carbon catabolite repression. Specific activities pyruvate kinase pyruvate decarboxylase glucose grown cells mutant wild type strains 4--5 times higher ethanol grown cells. Mutants gene HEX1 reduced hexose phosphorylating activity media whereas gene HEX2 elevated levels glucose grown cells. Mutants gene CAT80 normal respect. glycolytic enzymes normal mutants. also true glycolytic intermediates. hex1-mutants showed reduced fermentation repressing sugars. three genes appear involved catabolite repression several repressible enzymes. Even though three types mutants show limited overlap effects certain enzymes, still distinctly different action spectra. Carbon catabolite repression apparently depend sole accumulation glycolytic intermediates. activity products three genes HEX1, HEX2 CAT80 required directly indirectly triggering carbon catabolite repression. Even small segment carbon catabolite repression controlled several genes regulatory functions indicating entire regulatory circuit highly complex.
