 Berries cultivated grapevine Vitis vinifera notably responsive temperature, influence fruit quality hence future compatibility varieties current growing regions. Organic acids represent key component fruit organoleptic quality content significantly influenced temperature. objectives study (i) manipulate thermal regimes realistically capture warming-driven reduction malate content Shiraz berries, (ii) investigate mechanisms behind temperature-sensitive malate loss potential downstream effects berry metabolism. field compared untreated controls ambient temperature longer milder warming (2-4 degrees C differential three weeks; Experiment 1) shorter severe warming (4-6 degrees C differential 11 days; Experiment 2). complemented field trials control (25/15 degrees C) elevated (35/20 degrees C) day/night temperature controlled-environment trials using potted vines (Experiment 3). Elevating maximum temperatures (4-10 degrees C controls) pre-veraison stages led higher malate content, particularly warmer nights. Heating veraison ripening stages reduced malate content, consistent effects typically seen warm vintages. However, minimum temperatures also raised 4-6 degrees C, malate content reduced, suggesting regulation malate metabolism differs day night. Increased NAD-dependent malic enzyme activity decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pyruvate kinase activities, well accumulation various amino acids gamma-aminobutyric acid, suggest enhanced anaplerotic capacity TCA cycle need coping decreased cytosolic pH heated fruit.
