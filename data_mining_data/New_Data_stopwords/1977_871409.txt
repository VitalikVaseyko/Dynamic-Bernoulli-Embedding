 Zieve's syndrome (ZS), consists transient haemolytic anaemia, jaundice, hyperlipoproteinaemia, alcohol-induced liver disease, studied male patients acute (n = 20) remittent (n = 10) phase. Chronic alcoholics (n = 10) without haemolysis healthy male persons (n = 10) served controls. Erythrocytes separated old young cells means density-layer centrifugation. fractions contained older red cells disclosed pyruvate-kinase instability resulted impaired metabolism. Changes membrane lipid composition indicated increased cholesterol polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) also detected patients acute phase ZS. Alcohol-induced red-cell vitamin-E deficiency decrease PUFA levels may provoke oxidation reduced red-cell glutathione turn results enzyme instability. study lends support hypothesis putative role red-cell metabolic injury origin haemolysis ZS cannot envisaged without introducing membrane-linked extracellular cofactors.
