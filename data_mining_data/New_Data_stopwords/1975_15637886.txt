 pyruvate kinase deficiency high activity leucocyte isoenzyme may mask erythrocyte defect. Separation leucocytes erythrocytes bythe commonly used sedimentation filtration procedures requires rather large volumes blood, time-consuming, sometimes leaves unsatisfactorily large proportion leucocytes. present study least 95 % leucocytes, measured lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase sensitive marker leucocyte lysis, consistently removed differential lysis erythrocytes hypotonic saline. Haemolysates suitable erythrocyte enzyme assays prepared small quantities capillary blood (10-100 micro1) rapidly, cheaply, reproducibly method.
