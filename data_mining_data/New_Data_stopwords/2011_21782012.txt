 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Baicalein, active constituent derived Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi., previously shown significantly restore effectiveness beta-lactam antibiotics tetracycline methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). multiple therapeutic benefits, antibacterial actions baicalein may also involved overcoming bacterial resistance mechanisms. aim present study investigate antibacterial activities baicalein association various antibiotics selected Staphylococcus aureus strains known specific drug resistance mechanisms. MATERIAL METHODS: panel clinical MRSA strains used confirmation antibacterial activities baicalein. effect baicalein inhibiting enzymatic activity newly discovered MRSA-specific pyruvate kinase (PK), essential Staphylococcus aureus growth survival also examined. RESULTS: checkerboard dilution test time-kill assay, baicalein 16 mug/ml could synergistically restore antibacterial actions ciprofloxacin NorA efflux pump overexpressed SA-1199B, poor NorA substrate, pefloxacin. Moreover, synergistic effects observed baicalein combined ciprofloxacin 12 20 clinical ciprofloxacin resistant strains. MRSA PK studies, baicalein alone could inhibit enzymatic activity MRSA PK dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: results demonstrated baicalein could significantly reverse ciprofloxacin resistance MRSA possibly inhibiting NorA efflux pump vitro. inhibition MRSA PK baicalein could lead deficiency ATP might contribute antibacterial actions baicalein MRSA.
