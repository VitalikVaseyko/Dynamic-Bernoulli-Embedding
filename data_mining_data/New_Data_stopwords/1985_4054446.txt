 Activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex determines rate glucose oxidation animals including man. complex regulated reversible phosphorylation, phosphorylation resulting inactivation. Activity therefore dependent upon activities pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase phosphatase. Activity complex reduced diabetes starvation result insulin deficiency. mechanism involves activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase short-term effects products fatty acid oxidation longer term effects involving specific protein synthesis; hepatocytes signals may include lipid fuels glucagon. Activity branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex determines rate degradation branched chain aminoacids adjusted according dietary supply. complex regulated reversible phosphorylation, phosphorylation inactivating. liver kidney, muscles protein activator (free E1 component) may reactivate phosphorylated complex without dephosphorylation facilitate hepatic oxidation branched chain ketoacids. Metabolic adjustments induced diet diabetes include loss activator protein, loss total complex activity liver muscles, enhanced inactivation phosphorylation liver.
