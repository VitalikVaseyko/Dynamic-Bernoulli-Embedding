 Pancreatic beta-cell mitogenesis increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) glucose-dependent manner. study found alternative beta-cell nutrient fuels glucose, pyruvate, glutamine/leucine independently induced provided platform IGF-I induce INS-1 cell DNA synthesis absence serum. contrast, long chain FFA (>/=C(12)) inhibited 15 mM glucose-induced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation (+/-10 nM IGF-I) 95% within 24 h 0.2 mM FFA complexed 1% BSA (K(0.5) palmitate/1% BSA = 65-85 microM 24 h; t(0.5) 0.2 mM palmitate/1% BSA = approximately 6 h). FFA-mediated inhibition glucose/IGF-I-induced ss-cell DNA synthesis reversible, FFA oxidation appear required, FFA interfere glucose metabolism INS-1 cells. examination mitogenic signal transduction pathways INS-1 cells revealed glucose/IGF-I induction early signaling elements SH2-containing protein (Shc)- insulin receptor substrate-1/2-mediated pathways leading downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphoinositol 3'-kinase activation, unaffected FFA. However, glucose-/IGF-I-induced activation protein kinase B (PKB) significantly inhibited, protein kinase Czeta chronically activated FFA. possible FFA-mediated inhibition ss-cell mitogenesis contributes reduction beta-cell mass subsequent failure compensate peripheral insulin resistance vivo key pathogenesis obesity-linked diabetes.
