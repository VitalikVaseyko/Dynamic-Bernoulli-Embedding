 FATP1 mediates skeletal muscle cell fatty acid import, yet intracellular localization metabolic control role completely defined. Here, examine FATP1 localization metabolic effects overexpression mouse skeletal muscle. FATP1 protein detected mitochondrial plasma membrane fractions, obtained differential centrifugation, mouse gastrocnemius muscle. FATP1 abundant purified mitochondria, outer membrane soluble intermembrane, inner membrane plus matrix, enriched subfractions purified mitochondria. Immunogold electron microscopy localized FATP1-GFP mitochondria transfected C2C12 myotubes. FATP1 overexpressed gastrocnemius mouse muscle, adenovirus-mediated delivery gene hindlimb muscles newborn mice, fed weaning chow high-fat diet. Compared GFP delivery, FATP1 alter body weight, serum fed glucose, insulin triglyceride levels, whole-body glucose tolerance, either diet. However, fatty acid levels lower beta-hydroxybutyrate levels higher FATP1- GFP-mice, irrespective diet. Moreover, intramuscular triglyceride content lower FATP1- versus GFP-mice regardless diet, beta-hydroxybutyrate content unchanged high-fat-fed mice. Electroporation-mediated FATP1 overexpression enhanced palmitate oxidation CO2, acid-soluble intermediate metabolites, CO2 production beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited glucose unchanged, isolated mouse gastrocnemius strips. summary, FATP1 localized mitochondria, outer membrane intermembrane parts, mouse skeletal muscle, may crucial metabolic effects. Overexpressed FATP1 enhanced disposal systemic fatty acids intramuscular triglycerides. Consistently, contribute high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. However, FATP1 lead hyperketonemia, likely secondary sparing ketone body oxidation enhanced oxidation fatty acids.
