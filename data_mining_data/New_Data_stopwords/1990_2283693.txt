 Generally, individuals heterozygous haemoglobin (Hb AS) asymptomatic present haematological clinical manifestations. However, associated genetic abnormalities may influence presentation Hb cases. study conducted twenty children heterozygous HB presented clinical manifestations similar sickle cell anaemia. children anaemia associated several red cell morphological abnormalities. white blood cell counts elevated patients differential count studies showed substantial increase lymphocytes polymorphonuclear leucocytes majority cases. Forty-five per cent patients associated alpha-thalassaemia, 60 per cent beta-thalassaemia, 30 per cent G-6-PD deficiency 10 per cent partial glutathione reductase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase activity normal cases. Riboflavin deficiency encountered 30 per cent patients iron deficiency 15 per cent Hb heterozygotes. major clinical findings splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, vaso-occlusive crisis. majority patients received blood transfusions. hand foot syndrome identified three (15 per cent) patients. haematological clinical findings twenty Hb heterozygotes presented paper possible causes abnormalities discussed.
