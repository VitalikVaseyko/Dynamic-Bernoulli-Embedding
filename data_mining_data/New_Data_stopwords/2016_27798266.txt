 Following traumatic brain injury, complex cerebral energy perturbations occur. Correlating unfavourable outcome, high brain extracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio suggests hypoxic metabolism and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. investigated whether focal administration succinate, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate interacting directly mitochondrial electron transport chain, could improve cerebral metabolism. Microdialysis perfused disodium 2,3-(13)C2 succinate (12 mmol/L) 24 h nine sedated traumatic brain injury patients' brains, simultaneous microdialysate collection ISCUS analysis energy metabolism biomarkers (nine patients) nuclear magnetic resonance (13)C-labelled metabolites (six patients). Metabolites 2,3-(13)C2 malate 2,3-(13)C2 glutamine indicated tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism, 2,3-(13)C2 lactate suggested tricarboxylic acid cycle spinout pyruvate (by malic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase), lactate dehydrogenase-mediated conversion lactate. Versus baseline, succinate perfusion significantly decreased lactate/pyruvate ratio (p = 0.015), mean difference -12%, due increased pyruvate concentration (+17%); lactate changed little (-3%); concentrations decreased glutamate (-43%) (p = 0.018) glucose (-15%) (p = 0.038). Lower lactate/pyruvate ratio suggests better redox status: cytosolic NADH recycled NAD(+) mitochondrial shuttles (malate-aspartate and/or glycerol 3-phosphate), diminishing lactate dehydrogenase-mediated pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, lowering glutamate. Glucose decrease suggests improved utilisation. Direct tricarboxylic acid cycle supplementation 2,3-(13)C2 succinate improved human traumatic brain injury brain chemistry, indicated biomarkers (13)C-labelling patterns metabolites.
