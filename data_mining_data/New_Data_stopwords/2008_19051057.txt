 investigate differential expression genes skeletal muscle Yorkshire Chinese indigenous breed Meishan pigs, suppression subtractive hybridization carried many genes proved expressed significantly different two breeds. One gene highly expressed Meishan lowly expressed Yorkshire specific library, shared strong homology human pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Using semi-quantity quantity PCR, confirmed differential expression two breeds. Temporal spatial expression analysis indicated porcine PDK4 gene highly expressed skeletal muscle highest neonatal pigs. Complete cDNA cloning sequence analysis revealed porcine PDK4 gene contains open reading frame 1,221 bp. deduced amino acid sequence showed conservation evolution. G/A mutation intron 9 identified association analysis showed significantly associated intramuscular fat, muscle water content.
