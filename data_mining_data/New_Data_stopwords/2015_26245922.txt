 Temperature known significant impact performance, safety, cycle lifetime lithium-ion batteries (LiB). However, comprehensive effects temperature cyclic aging rate LiB yet found. use electrochemistry-based model (ECBE) measure effects aging behavior cycled LiB operating within temperature range 25 degrees C 55 degrees C. increasing degradation rate maximum charge storage LiB cycling elevated temperature found relate mainly degradations electrodes, degradation LCO cathode larger graphite anode elevated temperature. particular, formation modification surface films electrodes well structural/phase changes LCO electrode, reported literatures, found main contributors increasing degradation rate maximum charge storage LiB temperature specific operating temperature range. Larger increases Warburg elements cell impedance also found cycling higher temperature, seriously affect state health (SoH) LiB shown work.
