 interaction various metabolites agents 14CO2 production 0.1 mM [1-14C]-labelled 2-oxoisocaproate (KIC) 2-oxoisovalerate (KIV) studied rat human heart skeletal muscle preparations. Glucose carnitine effect studied systems; palmitate gave small increase KIC oxidation soleus muscle. rat hemidiaphragms considerable decrease found presence high concentrations competitive branched-chain 2-oxo acid pyruvate, presence ketone bodies. considerable increase found presence branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor 2-chloroisocaproate transminase inhibitor amino-oxyacetate. 2-Oxoglutarate increased clofibric acid decreased KIC oxidation. Divergent effects given intermediates degradation route KIC KIV monocarboxylate translocator inhibitors. observed interactions discussed related regulatory mechanisms known affect branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex.
