 halogenated phosphoenolpyruvate analogues (Z)-phosphoenol-3-fluoropyruvate, (E)-phosphoenol-3-fluoropyruvate, (Z)-phosphoenol-3-bromopyruvate synthesized purified. analogues characterized 1H 19F NMR applicable. Absolute stereoselectivity fluorophosphoenolpyruvate isomers substrates enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, enolase, pyruvate phosphate dikinase observed. Z isomer exhibited substrate activity enzymes substrate activity measured E isomer. isomers exhibited substrate activity enzyme pyruvate kinase, however, substantial decrease Vmax/Km ratio compared phosphoenolpyruvate substrate. metal ion dependent stereoselectivity inhibition measured analogues enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase. cation activator appears affect specificity thus catalytic site enzymes. Proton longitudinal relaxation rate titrations demonstrate dissociation constants, K3, fluorophosphoenolpyruvate isomers enzyme-Mn complex agree, cases, measured KI values analogue binding resembles phosphoenolpyruvate binding. enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, KI equal K3 (E)-fluorophosphoenolpyruvate suggests binding E isomer affected presence substrates. halogenated derivatives apparently undergo enzyme-Mn catalyzed Michael-type addition reaction bromo-substituted analogue decomposing much faster fluoro analogues.
