 Escherichia coli one widely used hosts production recombinant proteins, among reasons genetics far better characterized microorganism. improve understanding recombinant protein synthesis E. coli, production model recombinant protein, beta-galactosidase, studied response constitutive overexpression anaplerotic reaction afforded PEP carboxylase. end, IPTG wash-in experiment performed starting well-defined steady-state condition wild-type E. coli mutant defective acetate pathway constitutively overexpressed ppc. order compare dynamics fluxes time wash-in experiment, method referred transient metabolic flux analysis, based steady-state metabolic flux analysis, used. allowed us track intracellular changes/fluxes strains. observed flux towards fermentation products 3.6 times lower ppc overexpression mutant compared wild-type E. coli. former hand, PPC flux general higher. addition, flux towards beta-galactosidase higher (12.4 times), resulting five times protein activity. results indicate constitutively overexpressing anaplerotic ppc gene E. coli, TCA cycle intermediates increasingly replenished. additional supply protein precursors positive result recombinant protein production.
