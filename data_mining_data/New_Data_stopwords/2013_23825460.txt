 Bioenergetic profiling cancer cells great potential bring forward new effective therapeutic strategies along early diagnosis. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) methodology enables quantification flux control exerted different enzymatic steps metabolic network thus assessing contribution system's function. main goal demonstrate applicability MCA situ studies energy metabolism human breast colorectal cancer cells well normal tissues. seek determine metabolic conditions leading energy flux redirection cancer cells. main result obtained adenine nucleotide translocator exhibits highest control respiration human breast cancer thus becoming prospective therapeutic target. Additionally, present evidence suggesting existence mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes may represent way cancer cells avoid apoptosis. data obtained show MCA applied situ insightful cancer cell energetic research.
