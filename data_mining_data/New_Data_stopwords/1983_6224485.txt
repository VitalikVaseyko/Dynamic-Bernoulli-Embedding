 homogeneous open enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase consequences variations enzyme concentrations stationary enzyme activities investigated. unexpected behavior observed upon variation maximum activity pyruvate kinase. Depending experimental conditions increase concentration pyruvate kinase resulted either diminution stimulation stationary activity enzyme. increase maximum activity phosphofructokinase, however, stimulates activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. experimental results interpreted terms mathematical model, based kinetic properties enzymes involved. correlation observed changes activities phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase appearance multiple stationary states discussed.
