 generally believed mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase heterodimer consisting catalytic regulatory subunits. However, contribution two subunits kinase-mediated signal transduction remained undefined. present study recombinant components mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex employed order characterize role kinase catalytic subunit regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. results provide first evidence strongly suggesting catalytic subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase competent respond known effectors kinase activity well interact E2-core without assistance regulatory subunit.
