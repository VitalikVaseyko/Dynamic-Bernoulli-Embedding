 long-term risk malignancy associated stem cell therapies significant concern clinical application exciting technology. report cancer-selective strategy enhance safety stem cell therapies. Briefly, using cell engineering approach, show aggressive cancers derived human murine induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) strikingly sensitive temporary MYC blockade. hand, differentiated tissues derived human mouse iPSCs readily tolerate temporary MYC inactivation. cancer cells, endogenous MYC required maintain metabolic epigenetic functions embryonic cancer-specific pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2). summary, results implicate PKM2 cancer's increased MYC dependence indicate dominant MYC inhibition cancer-selective fail-safe stem cell therapies.
