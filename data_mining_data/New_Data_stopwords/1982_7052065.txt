 regulation type L pyruvate kinase concentrations liver young (35-45 days old) adult (60-85 days old) rats starved re-fed 71% sucrose diet investigated. Re-feeding accompanied increase enzyme level liver determined kinetically immunologically. constant ratio kinetic activity immunological activity observed conditions examined, indicating activity changes result regulation synthesis degradation interconversion kinetically active inactive forms enzyme. Synthesis pyruvate kinase directly examined using hepatocytes isolated starved re-fed rats. stimulation pyruvate kinase synthesis observed re-feeding. increase synthesis pyruvate kinase retained isolated hepatocyte 7h absence hormonal stimuli. Administration glucagon (1mum) isolated hepatocytes influence synthesis pyruvate kinase evidence glucagon-directed degradation enzyme found. Re-feeding rat followed transient increase synthesis pyruvate kinase. peak rate synthesis observed detectable increase enzyme concentration. rapid synthesis period, new steady-state level enzyme achieved synthesis rates declined. time course magnitude response sucrose diet dependent age rat. young rats, increase pyruvate kinase synthesis observed within 6h peak synthesis occurs 11h re-feeding sucrose. peak synthesis rate pyruvate kinase young rats represents approx. 1% total protein synthesis. adult rats, increased pyruvate kinase synthesis observed 11h, peak synthesis occurring 24h re-feeding. older rats, peak pyruvate kinase synthesis constitutes greater 4% total protein synthesis. Continued re-feeding adult rat beyond 24h accompanied decline pyruvate kinase synthesis approx. 1.5% total protein synthesis. concentration enzyme, however, decline period, suggesting control pyruvate kinase degradation well synthesis occurs.
