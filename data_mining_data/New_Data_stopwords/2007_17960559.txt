 aim study investigate acute effects troglitazone several pathways glucose fatty acid (FA) partitioning molecular mechanisms involved processes skeletal muscle. Exposure L6 myotubes troglitazone 1 h significantly increased phosphorylation AMPK ACC, followed approximately 30% approximately 60% increases palmitate oxidation carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) activity, respectively. Troglitazone inhibited basal ( approximately 25%) insulin-stimulated ( approximately 35%) palmitate uptake significantly increased basal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake approximately 2.2- 2.7-fold, respectively. Pharmacological inhibition AMPK completely prevented effects troglitazone palmitate oxidation glucose uptake. Interestingly, even though troglitazone exerted insulin sensitizing effect, reduced basal insulin-stimulated rates glycogen synthesis, incorporation glucose lipids, glucose oxidation values corresponding approximately 30%, approximately 60%, 30% controls, respectively. effects accompanied increase basal insulin-stimulated phosphorylation Akt(Thr308), Akt(Ser473), GSK3alpha/beta. Troglitazone also powerfully suppressed pyruvate decarboxylation, followed significant increase basal ( approximately 3.5-fold) insulin-stimulated ( approximately 5.5-fold) rates lactate production muscle cells. summary, provide novel evidence troglitazone exerts acute insulin sensitizing effects increasing FA oxidation, reducing FA uptake, suppressing pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, shifting glucose metabolism toward lactate production muscle cells. effects seem least partially dependent AMPK activation may account potential acute PPAR-gamma-independent anti-diabetic effects thiazolidinediones skeletal muscle.
