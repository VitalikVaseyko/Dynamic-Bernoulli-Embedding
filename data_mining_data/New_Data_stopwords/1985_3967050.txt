 rate biosynthesis pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) compared cells maintained normoxic hypoxic conditions. L8 cells (a myoblast cell line) pulse-labeled [3H]leucine incorporation radioactivity pyruvate kinase measured quantitative affinity separation anti-pyruvate kinase monoclonal antibody. chronic hypoxia increased rate biosynthesis pyruvate kinase leading increase enzyme content augmented glycolytic capacity. inhibitor electron transport chain, antimycin A, used determine whether changes pyruvate kinase content occurring hypoxia result reduction molecular oxygen directly indirect consequence oxygen depletion. Pyruvate kinase activity increased chronic antimycin exposure normoxic conditions. increase quantitatively accounted increase cellular pyruvate kinase enzyme content. suggested decreases levels molecular O2 direct stimulus increased content pyruvate kinase. likely increased pyruvate kinase content results depressed rates electron transport mitochondrial electron transport chain.
