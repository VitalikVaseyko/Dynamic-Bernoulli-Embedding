 endochondral bone, growth cartilage site rapid growth. Since vascular supply cartilage limited, widely assumed cells cartilage hypoxic limitations oxygen supply regulate energetic state maturing cells. report, evaluate effects oxygen tension chondrocyte energy metabolism, thiol status, expression transcription elements, HIF AP-1. Imposition hypoxic environment cultured chondrocytes caused proportional increase glucose utilization elevated levels lactate synthesis. Although observed statistical increase activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase exposure lowered oxygen concentrations, effect small. cultured cells exhibited decreased utilization glutamine, possibly due regulation mitochondrial function inhibition oxidative deamination. respect total energy generation, noted cells quite capable maintaining energy charge cell low oxygen tensions. Indeed, changes absolute quantity adenine nucleotides energy charge ratio observed. Hypoxia caused decrease glutathione content cultured chondrocytes concomitant rise cell medium cysteine levels. likely fall cell glutathione level due decreased synthesis tripeptide reduced oxygen stress limited supply glutamate. observed rise cellular medium cysteine levels probably reflects increase rate degradation glutathione decrease synthesis peptide. explore cells transduce metabolic effects, gel retardation assays used study chondrocyte HIF AP-1 binding activities. Chondrocyte nuclear preparations bound HIF-oligonucleotide; however, low oxygen tensions, increase HIF binding observed. addition, found AP-1 binding activities chondrocytes exposed low oxygen tensions elevated, although response lower exhibited fibroblasts exposed range oxygen concentrations. compared results HIF AP-1 binding cells growth plate. strong HIF AP-1 binding throughout plate, evidence selective binding one zone. results study lend strong support view chondrocytes well adapted low oxygen tensions; thus, hypoxic conditions, high level expression HIF AP-1, energy conservation appears near-maximum.
