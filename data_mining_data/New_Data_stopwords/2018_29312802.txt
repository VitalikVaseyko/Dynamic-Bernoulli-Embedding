 Patients suffered head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) overall poor prognosis owing proliferation resistance treatment. Hence, mining underlying mechanism malignancies translating bench outcomes clinical practice urgent need. Previous studies found epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) increases co-expresses EGFRvIII HNSCC tissues, indicates poor prognosis HNSCC patients. Here, clarify compared EGFRwt, EGFRwt/vIII enhances capability proliferation colony formation HNSCC cells vitro, reduces sensitivity cisplatin. Furthermore, EGFRwt/vIII induces nuclear translocation M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) time-dependent manner. aberrant expression PKM2 HNSCC suggests unfavorable outcome. Especially, nuclear PKM2 determines activation beta-catenin signaling regulates proliferation chemo-sensitivity HNSCC cells. Together, findings demonstrate EGFRwt/vIII-PKM2-beta-catenin cascade controls proliferation chemo-sensitivity HNSCC, thereby providing promising strategy diagnosis therapy HNSCC.
