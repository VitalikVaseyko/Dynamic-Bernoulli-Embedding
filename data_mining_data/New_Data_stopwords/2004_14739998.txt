 Cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) Pichia pastoris yeast cells found activated either cAMP cGMP. Analogs cAMP 8-chloro-cAMP 8-bromo-cAMP potent cAMP PKA activation N6,2'-O-dibutyryl-cAMP stimulate enzyme activity. shown protamine sulfate almost equally phosphorylated presence 1-2 x 10(-6)M cAMP cGMP substrates Kemptide, ribosomal protein S6, phosphorylated lower extent presence cGMP. demonstrated pyruvate kinase substrate PKA co-purified P.pastoris enzyme. Moreover, pyruvate kinase phosphorylated PKA presence cAMP cGMP comparable levels.
