 Rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase activator protein (KAP), free PDH kinase readily separable PDH complex intrinsic kinase, purified apparent homogeneity liver mitochondria fed 48-h starved rats. SDS-PAGE apparently single band M(r) 45 kDa obtained. N-Terminal amino acid sequence analyses (8-10 cycles) confirmed presence single peptide case. specific activity purified KAP 48-h starved rats (14,413 U/mg protein) 4.5-fold greater fed rats.
