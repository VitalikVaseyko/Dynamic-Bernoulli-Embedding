 mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) contains mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) kinase Rictor regulatory protein phosphorylates Akt. Whether function mTORC2 critical cancer progression unknown. Here, show transformed human prostate epithelial cells lacking PTEN require mTORC2 form tumors injected nude mice. Furthermore, find Rictor haploinsufficient gene deleting one copy protects Pten heterozygous mice prostate cancer. Finally, show development prostate cancer caused Pten deletion specifically prostate epithelium requires mTORC2, normal prostate epithelial cells, mTORC2 activity nonessential. selective requirement mTORC2 tumor development suggests mTORC2 inhibitors may substantial clinical utility.
