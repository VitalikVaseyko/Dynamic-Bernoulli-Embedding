 Exosomes vesicles secreted hematopoietic cells fusion multivesicular endosomes plasma membrane. Many studies reported exosomes may also released tumor cells. Exosomes believed play antitumor role immune cells. asked whether tumor exosomes biological activities tumor cells. report human pancreatic tumor nanoparticles, exosome-like characterized proteomic analyses rich lipid rafts, decreased tumor cell proliferation. Nanoparticles increased Bax decreased Bcl-2 expressions. Caspase-3 -9 caspase-8 inhibitors impaired apoptosis, implicates mitochondria apoptotic pathway. ceramide-sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway inoperative. Moreover, nanoparticles induced phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) -3beta activation decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. nanoparticle-treated cells, PTEN formed complexes actin, beta-catenin, GSK-3beta. Thus, beta-catenin may longer available activate survival pathway. Nanoparticles triggered down-regulation cyclin D1 poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Hence, nanoparticles counteracted constitutively activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt survival pathway drive tumor cells toward apoptosis. study provides first evidence apoptotic function tumor-derived nanoparticles tumor cells. propose new role nanoparticles, i.e., signal carriers interaction cells, may implications physiopathological situations.
