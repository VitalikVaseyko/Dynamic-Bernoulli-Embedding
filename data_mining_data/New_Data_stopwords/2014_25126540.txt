 Mitochondrial dysfunction long implicated progression cancer. paradigm, "Warburg effect," means switch toward anaerobic metabolism enables cancer cells proliferate oxygen limiting conditions, well established. Besides metabolic transformation tumors, discovered mutations genes encoding mitochondrial proteins etiological factors different types cancer. confers mitochondrial dysfunction causative role, rather resultant, tumor genesis beyond role tumor progression development. Mitochondrial proteins encoded tumor-suppressor genes part succinate-dehydrogenase, fumarate-hydratase, mitochondrial isocitrate-dehydrogenase enzymes, participating Krebs cycle. spectrum tumors associated mutations genes becoming larger varies enzyme. Several mechanisms tumorigenesis proposed different enzymatic defects, based studies using cellular animal models. Regarding molecular pathways implicated oncogenic transformation, one first accepted theories based constitutive expression hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif1alpha) normal oxygen tension, theory referred "pseudo-hypoxic drive." mechanism linked three types mutations, thus suggesting central role cancer. However, alternative molecular processes, oxidative stress altered chromatin remodeling, also proposed play onco-pathogenic role. recent years, role oncometabolites, new concept emerged biochemical studies upon tumors, acquired relevance responsible tumor formation. Nevertheless, actual contribution mechanisms definitively established. review, summarize results obtained mouse strains genetically modified three different enzymes.
