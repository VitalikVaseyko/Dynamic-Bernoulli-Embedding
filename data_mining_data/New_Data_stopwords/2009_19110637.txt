 Large animal models played crucial role development gene therapy protocols. significant advantage large animal models rodent models includes ability easily translate protocols developed large animals humans. gene therapy applications, nonhuman primates canines main large animal models. Canines advantage disease models available, e.g., hemolytic anemia (pyruvate kinase deficiency), leukocyte adhesion deficiency, severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID), storage diseases, others. addition, three major integrating virus systems, i.e., gammaretrovirus-, HIV-derived lenti- foamy virus vectors able efficiently transduce canine hematopoietic cells. describe protocols developed efficient transduction canine hematopoietic repopulating cells.
