 Metabolism may determine biologically malignant behavior pancreatic cancer. investigate significance prognostic value cancer metabolism cancer patients, investigated expression two key enzymes anaerobic glycolysis, hexokinase 2 (HK2) pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2), surgical specimens obtained 36 patients underwent curative resection pancreatic ductal carcinoma. hk2-glycolysis axis key system clinical imaging tumors via positron emission tomography. Immunohistochemical staining hk2 pkm2 performed data statistically analyzed evaluate prognostic power. expression hk2 pkm2 associated clinicopathological variables patient prognosis, including overall survival, local recurrence-free survival distant metastasis-free survival. Staining hk2 negative positive 42 58% patients, respectively, whereas staining pkm2 negative positive 56 44%, respectively; hk2-positive staining correlated progressive pathological tumor stage (pT3 vs. pT1 pT2; P=0.017). univariate analysis, positive expression hk2 pkm2, pathological stage (pT3 vs. pT1 pT2) nodal metastasis significantly correlated poor prognosis (P<0.03). multivariate analysis, pathological nodal metastasis independent prognostic factor overall survival, whereas positive expression hk2 pkm2 exhibited borderline significance (P=0.08 0.12, hazard ratio = 2.57 2.16, respectively). addition, combination high expression hk2 well pkm2 found significant (P<0.05). results suggested expression hk2 pkm2, particularly combination, surgical specimens obtained curative resection, may predict unfavorable clinical outcome patients pancreatic cancer.
