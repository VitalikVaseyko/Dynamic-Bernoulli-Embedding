 Decavanadate inhibits hexokinase, adenylate kinase phosphofructokinase; neither mono-, tri tetrameric vanadate anion inhibitor. Decavanadate inhibits phosphofructokinase obtained bacterial protistic sources. form vanadium(V) anion inhibits galacto-, glycero-, pyruvate creatine kinase, inorganic pyrophosphatase. Decavanadate appears non-competitive inhibitor hexokinase substrates.
