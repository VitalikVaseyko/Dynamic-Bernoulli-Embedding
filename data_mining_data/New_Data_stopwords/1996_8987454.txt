 Listeria innocua NCTC 11289 grown aerobically continuous culture defined media 30 degrees C. acetate lactate produced, proportion acetate decreased increasing dilution rate. Enzymatic analysis showed lactate dehydrogenase activated 10-fold fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate. presence phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase pyruvate oxidase detected, suggesting sequential action phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase produce acetate acetyl CoA via acetylphosphate.
