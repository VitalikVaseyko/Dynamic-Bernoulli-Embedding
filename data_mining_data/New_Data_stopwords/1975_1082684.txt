 difficulties drawing blood clinical chemistry small laboratory animals exist many methods sampling blood preparation serum, none generally accepted well standardised. aim study investigate effects sampling techniques normal values enzyme activities serum rat mouse. activities following enzymes determined: sorbitol dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, myokinase, alkaline phosphatase leucine aminopeptidase. addition plasmaproteins, urea inorganic phosphorus measured. rats blood obtained following sites: retroorbital venous plexus, jugular vein, heart ventral aorta. mice blood sampled jugular vein ventral aorta. Shifts water interstitial intravascular space due hypovolemia occurring experimental procedure followed measuring hematocrit distribution radioiodide labelled albumin. rats activities lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase myokinase found blood serum obtained retroorbital venous plexus ventral aorta high compared sampling sites. Activities alkaline phosphatase alanine aminotransferase slightly elevated blood sampled punctured retroorbital venous plexus. Small differences plasmaproteins hematocrit values found due acute shifts water within extracellular space. mice activities lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase myokinase found high blood serum obtained ventral aorta. Efflux enzymes damaged cells interstitial space ive caused erroneous results too, minor extent. reliable method blood sampling rat mouse cannulation jugular vein. heart puncture recommended too. Attention paid, however, possibility aspirating disrupted muscle cells inserted needle.
