 Aerobic exercise training evokes adaptations myocardial contractile machinery enhance cardiac functional capacity; comparison, effects training myocardium's energy generating pathways less well characterized. study tested hypothesis aerobic exercise training increase capacities major pathways intermediary metabolism canine myocardium. Mongrel dogs conditioned 9-week treadmill running program cage rested 4 weeks. Exercise conditioning evidenced 26% 22% decreases (P<0.05) respective heart rates rest submaximal exercise 40% increase (P<0.05) citrate synthase (CS) activity vastus lateralis. Glycolytic, TCA cycle, beta-oxidative enzymes assayed myocardial extracts 37 degrees C. Relative sedentary controls, training increased glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity 49% left 33% right ventricle, pyruvate kinase, CS, 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) activities 74%, 91%, 77%, respectively, left ventricle (P<0.05). Immunoblotting confirmed training increased left ventricular contents CS GAPDH. measured enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase) altered training either ventricle. Kinetic analyses revealed increased maximum rates unaltered substrate affinities GAPDH, CS HADH following training. Thus, aerobic exercise training augments intermediary metabolic capacity canine myocardium selectively increasing concentrations regulatory enzymes glycolysis oxidative metabolism.
