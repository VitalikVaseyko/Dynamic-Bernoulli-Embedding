 common metabolic hallmark malignant tumors, i.e., "Warburg effect" propensity metabolize glucose lactic acid high rate even presence oxygen. pivotal player frequent cancer phenotype mitochondrial-bound hexokinase [Bustamante E, Pedersen PL. High aerobic glycolysis rat hepatoma cells culture: role mitochondrial hexokinase. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1977;74(9):3735-9; Bustamante E, Morris HP, Pedersen PL. Energy metabolism tumor cells. Requirement form hexokinase propensity mitochondrial binding. J Biol Chem 1981;256(16):8699-704]. Now, clinics worldwide prominent phenotype forms basis one common detection systems cancer, i.e., positron emission tomography (PET). Significantly, HK-2 major bound hexokinase isoform expressed cancers exhibit "Warburg effect". includes cancers metastasize kill human host. stationing outer mitochondrial membrane, HK-2 also helps immortalize cancer cells, escapes product inhibition gains preferential access newly synthesized ATP phosphorylating glucose. latter event traps essential nutrient inside tumor cells glucose-6-P, funneled serve carbon precursors help promote production new cancer cells much converted lactic acid exits cells. resultant acidity likely wards immune response preparing surrounding tissues invasion. re-emergence acceptance "Warburg effect" prominent phenotype clinical cancers, "metabolic targeting" rational therapeutic strategy, number laboratories focusing metabolite entry exit steps. One remarkable success story [Ko YH, Smith BL, Wang Y, Pomper MG, Rini DA, Torbenson MS, et al. Advanced cancers: eradication cases using 3-bromopyruvate therapy deplete ATP. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004;324(1):269-75] use small molecule 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) selectively enters destroys cells large tumors animals targeting HK-2 mitochondrial ATP synthasome. leads rapid ATP depletion tumor destruction without harm animals. review focuses multiple roles played HK-2 cancer potential metabolic target complete cancer destruction.
