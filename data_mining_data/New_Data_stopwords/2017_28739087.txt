 Adipose dysfunction links tightly hepatic insulin resistance gluconeogenesis. Ilexgenin reported ability regulate lipid profile protect liver high fat diet (HFD) -induced impairment. Here, propose ilexgenin ameliorates hepatic insulin signaling gluconeogenesis regulating lipolysis white adipose tissue (WAT). Pyruvate tolerance test biochemical analysis coupled ex vivo siRNA knockdown co-culture studies demonstrate ilexgenin suppresses inflammation-associated lipolysis epididymal fat pad via 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, thus inhibits diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) translocation liver, leading improvement insulin sensitivity hepatic glucose production. findings suggest relationship adipose function hepatic insulin action may targeted natural bioactive components potential treatment hepatic insulin resistance related disorders.
