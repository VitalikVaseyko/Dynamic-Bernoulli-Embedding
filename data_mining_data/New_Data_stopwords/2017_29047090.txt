 Pulmonary hypertension complex disease pulmonary vasculature, severe cases terminates right heart failure. Complex remodeling pulmonary arteries comprises central issue pathology. includes extensive proliferation, apoptotic resistance inflammation. such, molecular cellular features pulmonary hypertension resemble hallmark characteristics cancer cell behavior. vascular remodeling derives significant metabolic changes resident cells, describe detail. affects cells pulmonary artery wall, also immediate microenvironment involving cells immune system (i.e., macrophages). Thus aberrant metabolism constitutes principle component cancer-like theory pulmonary hypertension. metabolic changes pulmonary artery cells resemble cancer associated Warburg effect, involving incomplete glucose oxidation aerobic glycolysis depressed mitochondrial catabolism enabling fueling anabolic reactions amino acids, nucleotides lipids sustain proliferation. Macrophages also undergo overlapping distinct metabolic reprogramming inducing specific activation polarization states enable participation vascular remodeling process. metabolic synergy drives chronic inflammation contributing remodeling. Enhanced glycolytic flux together suppressed mitochondrial bioenergetics promotes accumulation reducing equivalents, NAD(P)H. discuss enzymes reactions involved. reducing equivalents modulate regulation proteins using NAD(P)H transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 1 cofactor significantly impact redox status (through GSH, NAD(P)H oxidases, etc.), together act control phenotype cells pulmonary arteries. altered mitochondrial metabolism changes redox poise, together enhanced NAD(P)H oxidase activity reduced enzymatic antioxidant activity promotes pro-oxidative cellular status. Herein discuss described metabolic changes along resultant alterations redox status, result excessive proliferation, apoptotic resistance, inflammation, leading pulmonary arterial wall remodeling thus establishing pulmonary artery hypertension pathology.
