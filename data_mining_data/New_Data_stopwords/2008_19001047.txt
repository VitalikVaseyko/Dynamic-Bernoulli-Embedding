 Acute exercise performance represents major metabolic challenge skeletal muscle, also liver important source energy. However molecular adaptation liver one single bout exercise largely unknown. C57BL/6 mice performed 60 min treadmill run high aerobic intensity. Liver, soleus white gastrocnemius muscle removed immediately exercise. single bout exercise resulted rapid pronounced induction hepatic metabolic enzymes regulators metabolism transcription: glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase; 3-fold), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4; 4.8-fold), angiopoietin-like 4 (2.1-fold), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 (5.1-fold), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha; 3-fold). soleus white gastrocnemius muscle up-regulation IRS-2 PDK4 less pronounced compared liver significant induction PGC-1alpha could detected early time point. Activation AMPK found liver white gastrocnemius muscle phosphorylation Thr-172. induction endogenous insulin secretion glucose load directly exercise bout resulted significantly higher PKB/Akt phosphorylation liver exercised mice. markedly enhanced IRS-2 protein amount, presumably reduced serine/threonine phosphorylation IRS proteins induced acute exercise could responsible enhanced action insulin. conclusion, acute exercise induced rapid pronounced transcriptional adaptation liver, regulated hepatic IRS proteins leading improved cellular insulin signal transduction.
