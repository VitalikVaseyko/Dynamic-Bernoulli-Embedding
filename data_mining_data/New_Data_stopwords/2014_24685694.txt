 Cancer cell metabolism often characterized shift oxidative glycolytic bioenergetics pathway, phenomenon known warburg effect. Whether deregulation miRNAs contributes warburg effect remains largely unknown. show miR-181a expression increased thus induces metabolic shift colon cancer cells. miR-181a performs function inhibiting expression PTEN, leading increase phosphorylated AKT triggers metabolic shift. increase lactate production induced miR-181a results rapid growth cancer cells. results identify miR-181a molecular switch involved orchestration warburg effect colon cancer cells via PTEN/AKT pathway.
