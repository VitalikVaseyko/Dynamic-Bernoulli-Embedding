 p53 well-known transcription factor controls cell cycle arrest cell death response wide range stresses. Moreover, p53 regulates glucose metabolism mutation results metabolic switch Warburg effect found cancer cells. Nucleotide biosynthesis also critical cell proliferation cell division cycle. Nonetheless, little known whether p53 regulates nucleotide biosynthesis. demonstrated p53-inducible microRNA-34a (miR-34a) repressed inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), rate-limiting enzyme de novo GTP biosynthesis. Treatment anti-miR-34a inhibitor relieved expression IMPDH upon DNA damage. Ultimately, miR-34a-mediated inhibition IMPDH resulted repressed activation GTP-dependent Ras signaling pathway. summary, suggest p53 novel function regulating purine biosynthesis, aided miR-34a-dependent IMPDH repression.
