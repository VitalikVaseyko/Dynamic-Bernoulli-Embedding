 Aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect, key hallmark cancers. Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1) well-known oncoprotein implicated multiple malignant phenotypes cancers. Meanwhile, little known oncogenic functions mechanisms YBX1 bladder cancer. Based gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) TCGA RNAseq data, find YBX1 profoundly involved glycolysis part glucose metabolism. Loss- gain-of-function studies show YBX1 enhance glycolysis revealed expression glycolytic enzymes, glucose uptake, lactate secretion extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Inhibition glycolysis completely compromises tumor-promoting effect YBX1 tumor growth. Mechanistically, YBX1 regulates expression c-Myc HIF1alpha, upregulate glycolytic enzymes facilitate glycolysis. Moreover, vivo study confirms genetic silencing YBX1 markedly attenuates tumor growth tumor-suppressive effect largely dependent reduced glycolysis. Taken together, results, proof principle, provide novel insight oncogenic role YBX1 glycolysis suggest potential therapeutic strategy targeting YBX1 bladder cancer.
