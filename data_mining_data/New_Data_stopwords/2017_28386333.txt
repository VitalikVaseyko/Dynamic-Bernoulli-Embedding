 Warburg effect, characterized enhanced glycolysis lactate production, even aerobic conditions, one hallmarks cancer cells. However, mechanism underlying phenomenon remains poorly understood. Previous studies shown microRNA-150 (miR-150) significantly up-regulated various malignancies represents putative onco-miRNA human cancers. present study, aim investigate functional significance molecular target miR-150 glioma. result, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), specific E3 ligase hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1alpha), identified novel target miR-150. Consistently, cells overexpressing miR-150 exhibited metabolic shift, including enhanced glucose uptake lactate production, led rapid growth glioma cells. Therefore, results suggest miR-150 modulates Warburg effect glioma via VHL/HIF1alpha might provide novel option future treatments glioma.
