 branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, like pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, intramitochondrial enzyme subject regulation covalent modification. Phosphorylation causes inactivation dephosphorylation causes activation complexes. branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, believed distinct pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, integral component branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex sensitive inhibition branched-chain alpha-ketoacids, alpha-chloroisocaproate, phenylpyruvate, clofibric acid, octanoate dichloroacetate. Phosphorylation branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase occurs two closely-linked serine residues (sites 1 2) alpha-subunit decarboxylase. HPLC sequence data suggest homology amino acid sequence adjacent phosphorylation sites 1 2 complexes isolated several different tissues. Stoichiometry phosphorylation complexes studies 1 mol P/mol alpha-subunit 95% inactivation 1.5 mol P/mol alpha-subunit maximally phosphorylated complex. Site 1 site 2 phosphorylated similar rates total phosphorylation exceeded 1 mol P/mol alpha-subunit. complexes rabbit kidney, rabbit heart, rat heart showed 30-40% additional phosphorylation alpha-subunit beyond 95% inactivation. Site specificity studies carried kinase partially inhibited alpha-chloroisocaproate suggest phosphorylation site 1 primarily responsible regulation complex. capacity branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase oxidize pyruvate (Km = 0.8 mM, Vmax = 20% alpha-ketoisovalerate) interferes estimation activity state hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. disparity activity states two complexes physiologic states contributes interference. inhibitory antibody branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase used prevent interference pyruvate dehydrogenase assay. Almost hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase chow-fed rats active (greater 90% dephosphorylated). contrast, almost hepatic enzyme rats fed low-protein (8%) diet inactive (greater 85% phosphorylated). Fasting chow-fed rats effect activity state hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, i.e. greater 90% enzyme remains active state. However, fasting rats maintained low-protein diets greatly activates hepatic enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
