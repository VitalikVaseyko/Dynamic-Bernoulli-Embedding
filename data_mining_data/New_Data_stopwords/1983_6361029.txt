 Rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA enriched total polysomes immunoprecipitation specific antibody Staphylococcus aureus cells. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized enriched mRNA inserted PstI site pBR322, resultant recombinant DNA molecules used transform Escherichia coli. Three clones containing DNA complementary L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA identified colony hybridization, hybrid-selected translation, dot blot hybridization. partial restriction endonuclease map cDNA inserts constructed covering 1.86 kilobase pairs. cDNA insert recombinant plasmid pLPK-14 used hybridization probe quantitate L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA rat liver various treatments. level hybridizable L-type enzyme mRNA markedly increased high carbohydrate diet. Diabetes greatly reduced mRNA level liver rats maintained high carbohydrate diet, insulin administration resulted restoration mRNA level normal within 24 h. changes approximately proportional changes level translatable L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. Thus, conclude nutritional hormonal regulation synthesis hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase occurs pretranslational level.
