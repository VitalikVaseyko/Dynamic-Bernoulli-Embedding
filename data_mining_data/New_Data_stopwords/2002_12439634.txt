 BACKGROUND: Partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors raised great interest since expected counteract dysregulated gene expression hypertrophied cardiocytes. compounds developed treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus stable angina pectoris. shift fatty acid oxidation glucose oxidation leads reduced gluconeogenesis improved economy cardiac work. increased glucose oxidation achieved following enzyme inhibitors: etomoxir, oxfenicine, methyl palmoxirate, S-15176, metoprolol, amiodarone, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1); aminocarnitine, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2); hydrazonopropionic acid (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase); MET-88 (gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase); 4-bromocrotonic acid, trimetazidine, possibly ranolazine (thiolases); hypoglycin (butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase); dichloroacetate (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). CLINICAL TRIALS trimetazidine ranolazine showed shift substrate oxidation antianginal action. Etomoxir MET-88 improved function overloaded hearts increasing density Ca(2+) pump sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2). promoters SERCA2 alpha-myosin heavy-chain exhibit sequences expected respond transcription factors responsive glucose metabolites and/or peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPAR) agonists. progress elucidating novel compounds upregulate SERCA2 expression closely linked characterization regulatory sequences SERCA2 promoter.
