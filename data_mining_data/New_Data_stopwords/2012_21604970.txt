 shown mice infected mouse hepatitis virus A59 develop autoantibodies (autoAb) liver kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). proposed immune system stimulated alarm signals called damage-associated molecular patterns alarmins, investigated participation uric acid high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) autoimmune response elicited mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Mice subjected MHV infection increased plasmatic uric acid concentration significantly decreased 20 days daily treatment allopurinol and, simultaneously, autoAb FAH undetected. Furthermore, autoAb disappeared 30 days treatment ethyl pyruvate, along substantial reduction serum HMGB1 concentration. results indicated remarkable relationship autoimmune process induced virus uric acid HMGB1 liberation. Unexpectedly, found allopurinol ethyl pyruvate inhibited release uric acid HMGB1. HMGB1 activated binding interleukin 1beta, cytokine produced NLRP3 inflammasome could stimulated uric acid, propose alarmins could acting concert induction autoAb FAH MHV-infected mice.
