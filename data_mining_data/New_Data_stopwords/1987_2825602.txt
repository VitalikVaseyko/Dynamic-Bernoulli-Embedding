 immortalized rat liver cell line (RLC) expresses two isozymes pyruvate kinase, adult liver L-type isozyme M-type isozyme presumed M2-type. RLC cells incubated serum-free medium, addition 0.1 microM insulin maintained initial level L-type pyruvate kinase high induced L-type isozyme low. addition 1.0 mM dibutyryl cAMP 0.5 mM theophylline decreased L-type isozyme, even presence insulin. amount M2-type isozyme relatively constant conditions used. Regulation amount L-type pyruvate kinase insulin cAMP occurred primarily changes rate L-pyruvate kinase protein synthesis translatable mRNA levels. results consistent vivo observations insulin glucagon regulate rate L-pyruvate kinase gene transcription cAMP dominant regulator L-pyruvate kinase gene expression.
