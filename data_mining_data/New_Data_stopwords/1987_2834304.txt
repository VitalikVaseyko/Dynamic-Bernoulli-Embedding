 study enzyme activity glucose metabolism lymphocytes patients solid malignant tumors reported. results shown 30% mean increase hexokinase (HK) activity patients solid malignant tumors compared mean value observed group healthy subjects. relationship level HK increase stage tumor also observed. examined enzyme activities, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate-kinase (PK), phosphoglycerate-kinase (PGK), phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) enolase show significant changes. concluded even though use HK tumor marker cannot hypothesized present time, significant relation increased activity enzyme presence tumor unquestionable. Therefore, biochemical effect induced away neoplastic tissue deserves study.
