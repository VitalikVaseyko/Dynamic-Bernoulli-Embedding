 Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) recognized important cancer drug target. Many recent studies provided convincing evidences strong correlation elevated levels HIF-1 tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, poor patient prognosis well tumor resistance therapy. found hypoxia (low O2 levels) common character many types solid tumors. adaptive response hypoxic stress, hypoxic tumor cells activate several survival pathways carry essential biological processes different ways compared normal cells. Recent advances cancer biology cellular molecular levels highlighted HIF-1alpha pathway crucial survival pathway novel strategies cancer therapy could developed. However, targeting HIF-1alpha pathway challenging promising progresses made past twenty years. review summarizes role regulation HIF-1alpha cancer, recent therapeutic approaches targeting important pathway.
