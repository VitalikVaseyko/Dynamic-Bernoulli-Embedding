 examination one fundamental vitro characteristics Mycobacterium bovis--its requirement pyruvate glycerol medium--we revealed lesion central metabolism profound implications vivo growth nutrition. M. bovis unable use glycerol sole carbon source lack functioning pyruvate kinase (PK) means carbohydrates cannot used generate energy. disruption sugar catabolism caused single nucleotide polymorphism pykA, gene encodes PK, substitutes glutamic acid residue 220 aspartic acid residue. Substitution highly conserved amino acid residue renders PK inactive thus blocks ATP generating roles glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway. mutation found occur members M. tuberculosis complex, namely M. microti M. africanum. carbohydrates unable act carbon sources, importance lipids gluconeogenesis growth vivo becomes apparent. Complementation M. bovis pykA gene M. tuberculosis H37Rv restored growth glycerol. Additionally, presence functioning PK caused colony morphology complemented strain change characteristic dysgonic growth M. bovis eugonic growth, appearance normally associated M. tuberculosis. also suggest glycerol-soaked potato slices used derivation M. bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine strain selected M. bovis PK+ mutant, finding explains alteration colony morphology noted derivation BCG. summary, disruption key step glycolysis divides M. tuberculosis complex two groups distinct carbon source utilization.
