 1. physiological response rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) reared different levels available carbohydrate practical trout diets levels energy nitrogen 16-24 weeks determined. 2. Weight gain significantly reduced trout reared highest level available carbohydrate, 210 g cerelose (alpha-glucose) kg, significant linear regression (R2 0.88 dietary carbohydrate weight gain. 3. Liver: body-weight values liver glycogen levels increased relation increased dietary carbohydrate. 4. Liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) activity increased liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) activity decreased per kg body-weight fish increasing dietary carbohydrate. However, significant effect noted activity liver enzymes dietary cerelose level 140 g/kg. 5. Liver fructose diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) activity increased increasing dietary carbohydrate interpreted meaning recycling triosephosphate glucose-6-phosphate. 6. Dietary carbohydrate level significant effect liver pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity, rate glucose utilization percentage conversion [14C]alanine glucose plasma trout. 7. results indicate rainbow trout limited ability adapt increased dietary carbohydrate level excess 140 g/kg diet efficiently utilized.
