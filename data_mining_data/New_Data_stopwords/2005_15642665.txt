 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Chronic hemolytic anemias frequent diseases intertropical countries mainly caused hemoglobin disorders. studied Vietnamese family first child suffered severe transfusion-dependent anemia. family requested antenatal diagnosis second pregnancy. characterize molecular defect, studied family three generations. DESIGN METHODS: Blood family members sampled full hematologic evaluation, including enzymatic dosage, DNA analysis performed patients displaying pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK-R). Mutation research 11 exons PKLR gene done using scanning method sequencing. Deletion evidenced Sybergreen based quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mapped using quantitative multiplex PCR short fluorescent fragments spread along whole sequence PKLR gene. RESULTS: Hematologic molecular studies severe chronic anemia demonstrated existence two defects PKLR gene, new mutation located exon 7: c.948C->G (N316K) large deletion extending exon 4 exon 10. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSIONS: describe family south-east Asian country; proband severe transfusion-dependent chronic anemia caused association two PKLR gene mutations, PK Saigon (N316K) PK Viet del 4-10. Severe chronic anemia could induced various molecular defects mainly affecting globin genes. However, even populations hemoglobin diseases frequent, enzymatic diseases considered.
