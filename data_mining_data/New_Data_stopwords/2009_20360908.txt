 objective paper provide overview recent developments muscle physiology biochemistry general, respect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) specifically. way illustration, presented data remodeling occurs vastus lateralis two patients COPD (COPD #1, forced expiratory volume one second/forced vital capacity [FEV(1)/FVC] = 63%; COPD #2, FEV(1)/FVC = 41%) exhibiting differences muscle wasting compared healthy controls (CON; FEV(1)/FVC = 111 +/- 2.2%, n = 4). Type fibers percentages lower COPD #1 (16.7) COPD #2 (24.9) compared CON (57.3 +/- 5.2). Cross sectional area type fibers patients ranged 65%-68% CON type II subtypes (IIA, IIAX, IIX) 74% 89% (COPD #1) 17%-32% (COPD #2). lower number capillary contacts observed fiber types COPD #1 COPD #2. Lower concentrations adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (24%-26%) phosphocreatine (18%-20%), lactate occurred COPD. contrast COPD #1, displayed normal glucose transporter content, GLUT1 GLUT4 71% 54%, respectively CON COPD #2. Lower monocarboxylate contents found MCT1 COPD #1 (63%) COPD #2 (41%) MCT4 (78%) COPD #1. Maximal oxidative enzyme activities (V(max)) COPD #2 ranged 37% (succinic dehydrogenase) 70% (cytochrome C oxidase) CON. cytosolic enzymes, V(max) ranged 89% (hexokinase) 31% (pyruvate kinase) CON. Depressions also observed V(max) Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase COPD #1 (66% CON) COPD #2 (92% CON) V(max) Ca(2+)-ATPase near normal COPD #1 (84% CON). concluded disturbances occur muscle wide range excitation, contraction metabolic processes COPD.
