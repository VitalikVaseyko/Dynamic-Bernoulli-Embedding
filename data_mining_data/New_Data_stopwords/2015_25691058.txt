 Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) rare aggressive tumor poor prognosis metastatic diagnosis. tumor biology still mostly unclear, justifying limited specificity efficacy anti-cancer drugs currently available. study reports first proteomic analysis ACC using two-dimensional-differential-in-gel-electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) evaluate differential protein expression profile adrenocortical carcinoma normal adrenal. Mass spectrometry, associated 2D-DIGE analysis carcinomas normal adrenals, identified 22 proteins 27 differentially expressed 2D spots, mostly overexpressed ACC. Gene ontology analysis revealed proteins concurs towards metabolic shift, called Warburg effect, adrenocortical cancer. differential expression validated Western blot Aldehyde-dehydrogenase-6-A1,Transferrin, Fascin-1,Lamin A/C,Adenylate-cyclase-associated-protein-1 Ferredoxin-reductase. Moreover, immunohistochemistry performed paraffin-embedded ACC normal adrenal specimens confirmed marked positive staining 6 proteins diffusely expressed neoplastic cells, compared normal adrenal cortex.In conclusion, preliminary findings reveal different proteomic profile adrenocortical carcinoma compared normal adrenal cortex characterized overexpression mainly metabolic enzymes, thus suggesting Warburg effect also occurs ACC. proteins may represent promising novel ACC biomarkers potential therapeutic targets validated larger cohorts patients.
