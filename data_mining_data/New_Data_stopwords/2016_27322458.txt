 Currently, therapeutic options exist castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients developed resistance second generation anti-androgen receptor (AR) axis therapy. report co-deletion Pten p53 murine prostate epithelium, often observed human CRPC, leads AR-independent CRPC thus confers de novo resistance second generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) multiple independent yet complementary preclinical mouse models. contrast, mechanism-driven co-targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated Warburg effect 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) ULK1-dependent autophagy chloroquine (CQ) selectively kills cancer cells intrinsic apoptosis cause tumor regression xenograft, leads near-complete tumor suppression remarkably extends survival Pten-/p53-deficiency-driven CRPC mouse model. Mechanistically, 2-DG causes AMPK phosphorylation, turn inhibits mTORC1-S6K1 translation signaling preferentially block anti-apoptotic protein MCL-l synthesis prime mitochondria-dependent apoptosis simultaneously activates ULK1-driven autophagy cell survival counteract apoptotic action anti-Warburg effect. Accordingly, inhibition autophagy CQ sensitizes cancer cells apoptosis upon 2-DG challenge. Given 2-DG recommended phase II clinical trials prostate cancer CQ clinically used anti-malaria drug many decades, preclinical results proof-of-principle studies vivo imminently translatable clinical trials evaluate therapeutic efficacy combination modality subset currently incurable CRPC harboring PTEN TP53 mutations.
