 adapted bioluminescence methods able measure phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity one-step technique. method employs four-enzyme system (PDE, adenylate kinase (AK) using excess CTP instead ATP substrate, pyruvate kinase (PK), firefly luciferase) generate ATP, measurement concomitant luciferase-light emission. Since AK, PK, luciferase reactions coupled recur cyclic manner, AMP recycling maintains constant rate ATP formation, proportional steady-state AMP concentration. cycle initiated PDE reaction yields AMP. long PDE reaction rate limiting, system effectively steady state bioluminescence kinetics progresses constant rate proportional PDE activity. absence cAMP PDE, low concentrations AMP trigger AMP cycling, allows standardizing system. sensitivity method enables detection <1 muU (pmol/min) PDE activity cell extracts containing 0.25-10 mug protein. Assays utilizing pure enzyme showed 0.2 mM IBMX completely inhibited PDE activity. single-step enzyme- substrate-coupled cyclic-reaction system yields simplified, sensitive, reproducible, accurate method quantifying PDE activities small biological samples.
