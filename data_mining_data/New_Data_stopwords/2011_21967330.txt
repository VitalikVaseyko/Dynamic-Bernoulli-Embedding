 Borrowing method folk healers A. Omelchenko R. Brois treatment oncology patients, evaluated positive results treatment method, author explains substantiates method using concept Warburg effect. addition, effects organism treatment method explored author himself, outcomes analyzed described. Explanations mechanism presented method provided points view biochemistry, physical chemistry, biophysics, also using concept Warburg effect (most cancer cells predominantly produce energy high rate glycolysis cytosol, rather comparatively low rate glycolysis followed oxidation pyruvate mitochondria like normal cells). increase lactic acid production necessary endoergonic mechanism accumulation energy required huge anabolic processes glycolysis metabolism enormous consumption energy anabolic processes cancer tissue, i.e. lactic acids accumulate energy anabolic processes cancer tissue metabolism (see section II). Prolonged medical starvation (42-45 days) treatment oncologic patients used presented method. Following explanation distinctions Warburg effect medical targets treatment cancer, author substantiates theoretically possibility new method cancer disease treatment. presented method cancer treatment also described detail. Evaluations mechanisms activity medical targets used modern methods given, also using Warburg effect mechanism. addition, author suggests possible modes integrate presented method treatment cancer modern cancer treatment methods, encourages pursuit following detailed clinical trials.
