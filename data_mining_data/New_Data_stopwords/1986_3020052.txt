 complete nucleotide sequences rat M1- M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs determined sequencing cDNAs analyses S1 nuclease mapping primer extension. sequences identical molecular size 2220 nucleotides excluding poly(A) tail include 1593-nucleotide coding region. nucleotide sequences identical except 160-nucleotide sequences within coding regions. amino acid sequences M1- M2-type subunits deduced cDNA sequences differ 45 residues within domain C, constitutes main region responsible intersubunit contact. sequence region M2-type shows higher homology M1-type corresponding sequence L-type. Since M2- L-types allosteric enzymes, unlike M1-type, residues common M2- L-types, M1-type may important mediating allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding M1- M2-type isozyme mRNAs isolated. partial sequence analysis clone lambda MPK37 four exons identified, two adjacent exons coded M1- M2-specific sequences, respectively. two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common two isozymes. Thus, conclude M1- M2-type isozymes pyruvate kinase produced gene probably alternative RNA splicing.
