 obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat shows impaired sympathetic tone accompanied altered thermogenesis changes lipid carbohydrate metabolism. work, investigated regulatory effects epinephrine rate gluconeogenesis mixture [(14)C]lactate/pyruvate, hepatocytes isolated obese (fa/fa) rats lean (Fa/-) littermates. Epinephrine caused dose-dependent stimulation rate [(14)C]glucose formation obese lean rat hepatocytes, maximal rates five- twofold higher corresponding basal values (0.50 +/- 0.06 1.96 +/- 0.15 micromol lactate converted glucose/g cell x 20 min, respectively). significant differences found calculated half-maximal effective concentrations (EC(50)) epinephrine obese lean rat liver cells. stimulation gluconeogenesis epinephrine accompanied decrease cellular concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, inactivation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase, similar extents types hepatocytes. Epinephrine also significantly raised hepatocyte content cyclic AMP, twofold increase saturating concentration catecholamine (1 microM), lean obese rat liver cells. However, suboptimal concentrations epinephrine, rise cyclic AMP levels significantly less marked obese lean rat hepatocytes. Nevertheless, significant differences found either affinity number beta-adrenergic receptors, radioligand binding studies carried liver plasma membranes obtained obese lean Zucker rats. conclusion, compared corresponding basal values, response gluconeogenesis lactate stimulatory effect epinephrine higher obese (fa/fa) lean (Fa/-) Zucker rat hepatocytes, significant differences calculated EC(50) values hormone. occurs spite apparent decreased sensitivity adenylate cyclase system stimulatory effect epinephrine obese rat liver cells.
