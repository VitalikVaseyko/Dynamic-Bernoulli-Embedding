 Male mice 7 different strains injected i.p. 400 mg/kg butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). 2 4 days later, incorporation thymidine pulmonary DNA significantly increased treated animals accompanied increase lung weight pulmonary DNA. Thymidine kinase activity DNA polymerase activity enhanced lungs BHT-treated animals maximum activity enzymes appeared precede maximum thymidine incorporation 24 h. 3 days BHT good correlation found administered dose thymidine kinase activity. Measuring activity enzyme might serve convenient biochemical marker follow quantitate BHT-produced cell proliferation lung. concentrations cyclic AMP activity adenylate cyclase altered BHT days 1-9 administration. BHT produced also dose-dependent, time-dependent increases activities pulmonary 5'-nucleotidase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), little effect isocitric dehydrogenase (ICDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) lactic dehydrogenase (LDH).
