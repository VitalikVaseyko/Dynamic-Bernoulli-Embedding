 effect electromagnetic field millimeter range biochemical indices testicles totally exposed rats various periods observation (day 1, 10, 30, 90) studied. following functional shifts revealed: 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities enforced approximately 130% 30th day comparison controls, three months (90th day) activity returned normal values: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase puruvate kinase show obvious changes activities. contrary, surprising differences behavior androgen-receptor system: number androgen-receptor sites cytosol increased significantly 1st day exposure (114%); 10th day concentration RA quite oppositely 1.68-fold reduced relation control; 1-month exposure rising [RA] (123%) registered; however, 3-month term significant fall (1.42 times) RA contents testicular cytosol persisted.
