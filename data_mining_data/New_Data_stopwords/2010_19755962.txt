 Human erythrocyte R-type pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) disorder caused mutations PKLR gene produces chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Besides periodic blood transfusion splenectomy, severe cases require bone marrow (BM) transplant, makes disease good candidate gene therapy. Here, normal human R-type pyruvate kinase (hRPK) complementary (cDNA) expressed hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived pklr deficient mice, using retroviral vector system. mice show similar red blood cell phenotype observed human PKD. Transduced HSCs transplanted myeloablated adult PKD mice utero injected nonconditioned PKD fetuses. myeloablated recipients, hematological manifestations PKD completely resolved normal percentages late erythroid progenitors, reticulocyte erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin levels erythrocyte biochemistry restored. Corrected cells preserved rescuing capacity secondary tertiary transplant. corrected cells utero transplanted, partial correction erythrocyte disease obtained, although low number corrected cells became engrafted, suggesting different efficiency cell therapy applied utero. data suggest transduction human RPK cDNA PKLR mutated HSCs could effective strategy severe cases PKD.
