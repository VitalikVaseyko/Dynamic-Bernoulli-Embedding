 important goal whole-cell computational modeling integrate detailed biochemical information biological intuition produce testable predictions. Based premise prokaryotes Escherichia coli maximized growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions steady state using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, show recent intracellular flux data wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement FBA predictions. Although assumption optimality wild-type bacterium justifiable, argument may valid genetically engineered knockouts bacterial strains exposed long-term evolutionary pressure. address point introducing method minimization metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby test hypothesis knockout metabolic fluxes undergo minimal redistribution respect flux configuration wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming identify point flux space, closest wild-type point, compatibly gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA FBA predictions experimental flux data E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, find MOMA displays significantly higher correlation FBA. method supported experimental data E. coli knockout growth rates. therefore used predicting behavior perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance general suboptimal. MOMA possible future extensions may useful understanding evolutionary optimization metabolism.
