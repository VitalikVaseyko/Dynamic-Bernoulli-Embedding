 systematic procedure kinetic study irreversible inhibition, enzymatic activity measured presence coupled enzyme system, developed analyzed. Simultaneous variation enzyme inhibitor concentrations, maintaining constant ratio them, recommended. methodology established estimate kinetic constants corresponding irreversible inhibitor. approach illustrated study inhibition fluorescein isothiocyanate Ca2+-ATPase activity sarcoplasmic reticulum measured presence pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase auxiliary enzymes. Treatment experimental data carried non-linear regression.
