 BACKGROUND: Advances melanoma treatment targeted inhibition oncogenic BRAF limited owing development acquired resistance. involvement BRAFV600E metabolic reprogramming melanoma cells provides rationale co-targeting metabolism therapeutic approach. METHODS: examined effects dichloroacetate (DCA), inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, growth metabolic activity human melanoma cell lines. combined effect DCA BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib investigated BRAFV600E -mutated melanoma cell lines. Vemurafenib-resistant cell lines established vitro sensitivity DCA tested. RESULTS: DCA induced reduction glycolytic activity intracellular ATP levels, inhibited cellular growth. Co-treatment BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells DCA vemurafenib induced greater reduction intracellular ATP levels cellular growth either compound alone. addition, melanoma cells vitro acquired resistance vemurafenib retained sensitivity DCA. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest DCA potentiates effect vemurafenib cooperative attenuation energy production. Furthermore, demonstration retained sensitivity DCA melanoma cells acquired resistance vemurafenib could implications melanoma treatment.
