 studied source-sink relationships model consisting single-rooted leaves without petioles. previously reported rate photosynthesis decreased C4 model plants prepared Amaranthus cruentus leaves subjected sink-limited conditions exposure continuous light days. suggested inhibition due coordinated decrease activity ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPcase) phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxylase (PEPcase), essential enzymes photosynthesis C4 plants. investigated mechanisms behind decreased activity RuBPcase, PEPcase, NAD-malic enzyme NAD-malate dehydrogenase. results suggested (1) initial activity RuBPcase suppressed lowering P(i) level chloroplasts, (2) inhibition PEPcase due dephosphorylation enzyme via inhibition PEPcase kinase PEPcase phosphatase, (3) inhibition NAD-malic enzyme NAD-malate dehydrogenase derived oxidation enzymes, (4) proteinous factor(s) may involved inhibition activity latter three enzymes. significance coordinated decrease enzymes response change source-sink balance discussed.
