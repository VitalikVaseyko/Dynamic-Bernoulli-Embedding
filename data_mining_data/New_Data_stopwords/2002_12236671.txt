 Eighteen proteins peptides found change post-mortem Longissimus dorsi pig muscle identified use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 18 peptides originate 9 different proteins including 3 structural proteins (actin, myosin heavy chain, troponin T) 6 metabolic proteins glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, myokinase, pyruvate kinase, dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase. molecular weight estimated sequence length identified spots show fragments result proteolytic activity meat. Identification parent proteins enhanced post-mortem appearance degradation products make specific peptides good candidates meat quality markers, studies specific fragments lead better understanding proteolytic activities involved post-mortem conversion muscle meat.
