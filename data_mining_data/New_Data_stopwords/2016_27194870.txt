 OBJECTIVE: Cancerous cells show increased glycolysis rate. increase overall levels pyruvate one end products glycolysis. present on-going study estimate levels pyruvate saliva serum among healthy oral cancer subjects. SETTINGS DESIGN: Hospital-based cross-sectional comparative study. METHODOLOGY: total 50 subjects among healthy oral cancer subjects selected based clinical histological criteria. Saliva serum samples collected subjected pyruvate level estimation using biochemical analysis. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis Mann-Whitney test used find statistical difference two independent groups. RESULTS: Serum pyruvic acid levels healthy group 1.09 +/- 0.14 oral cancer, 2.95 +/- 0.59 salivary level 3.49 +/- 0.47 1.32 +/- 0.10 respectively. Mann-Whitney test showed statistically significant difference serum salivary pyruvate level two groups (P < 0.000 respectively). CONCLUSION: present study showed noticeable variation level pyruvic acid among healthy oral cancer subjects. generates hypothesis estimation pyruvic acid new tool screening cancer.
