 prognosis patients hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may improved novel treatments focusing characteristic metabolic changes disease. Therefore, analyzed biological interactions metabolic features degree tumor differentiation level malignant potential 41 patients completely resectable HCC. expression levels resected samples mRNAs encoded genes related tumor metabolism metastasis investigated, correlation expression levels degrees differentiation analyzed. 41 patients, 2 patients grade I, 27 grade II, 12 grade III tumors. Reductions levels 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADHA) acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX)-2 mRNAs, increases pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) mRNA significantly correlated progression de-differentiation. Analysis partial correlation coefficients showed level PKM2 mRNA expression significantly correlated pro-angiogenic genes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ETS-1. Moreover, levels VEGF-A ETS-1 mRNA expression independently correlated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)related gene SNAIL. findings suggest reductions fatty acid oxidation responses hypoxia may affect progression malignant phenotypes HCC.
