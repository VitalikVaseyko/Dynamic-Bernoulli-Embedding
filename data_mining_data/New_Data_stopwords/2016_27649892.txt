 Metabolic reprogramming one emerging hallmarks cancers. highly malignant tumor, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) metabolic disease also heterogeneous disease. Heterogeneity induces PDA dependence distinct nutritive substrates, thereby inducing different metabolic phenotypes. stratified PDA four phenotypes distinct types energy metabolism, including Warburg phenotype, reverse Warburg phenotype, glutaminolysis phenotype, lipid-dependent phenotype. four phenotypes possess distinct metabolic features reprogram metabolic pathways adapt stress. metabolic type present PDA prompt differential imaging serologic metabolite detection diagnosis prognosis. targeting individual metabolic phenotype corresponding metabolic inhibitors considered promising therapeutic approach and, combination chemotherapy, expected novel strategy PDA treatment.
