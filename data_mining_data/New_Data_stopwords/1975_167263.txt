 Daily fluctuations serum enzyme activities distance running 3 well-conditioned males measured 8 consecutive days. study exercise regimen comprised 8 mile runs days 1, 2 5; 10.5 mile run day 3; 15 mile run day 4 resting days 6-8. Heart rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit, plasma hemoglobin, creatine phosphokinase (CPK, glutamic-oxaloacetic glutamic-pyruvic transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), adenylate kinase (AK), lactate pyruvate measured exercise resting days. Significant increases occurred heart rate rectal temperature run unrelated enzyme levels. Pre-exercise CPK levels, 49 plus minus 1 mIU/ml day 1, rose progressively 123 plus minus 25 mIU/ml day 5, returned initial control levels day 8. Post-exercise CPK levels significantly greater pre-exercise levels running day unrelated severity exercise. LDH AK levels significantly change exercise stress, pre-exercise AK levels trained males higher values non-trained males (10-20 vs. 0-5 mIU/ml) (3). Post-exercise enzyme levels appeared unrelated final heart rate, rectal temperature plasma hemoglobin. results suggest (1) CPK, unlike enzymes studied, sensitive index exercise stress well-conditioned runners (2) elevated CPK AK levels runners represent physiologic responses. Appropriate caution used making clinical judgements enzyme assays trained individuals.
