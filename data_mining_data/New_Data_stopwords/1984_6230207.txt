 Kinetic studies carried pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase lizard Lacerta galloti. Pyruvate kinase inhibited ATP activated fructose 1,6-biphosphate giving hyperbolic saturation curve ATP without activator becomes sigmoidal saturating concentrations fructose 1,6-biphosphate, giving moderate cooperativity Hill coefficient h = 1.72. Binding fructose 1,6-biphosphate pyruvate kinase studied protection effect thermal denaturation, suitable ligand tested avoid loss activity. Phosphofructokinase inhibited ATP millimolar range activated AMP fructose 2,6-biphosphate, AMP efficient activator.
