 BACKGROUND: Germline somatic mutations STK11, gene encoding serine/threonine kinase LKB1, strongly associated tumorigenesis. loss LKB1 expression linked breast cancer, mechanistic role LKB1 regulating breast cancer development, metastasis, tumor metabolism remained unclear. METHODS: generated analyzed transgenic mice expressing ErbB2 mammary epithelium LKB1 wild-type LKB1-deficient mice. also utilized ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells LKB1 levels reduced using shRNA approaches. transgenic xenograft models characterized effects LKB1 loss tumor initiation, growth, metastasis tumor cell metabolism. RESULTS: demonstrate loss LKB1 promotes tumor initiation induces characteristic shift aerobic glycolysis ('Warburg effect') model ErbB2-mediated breast cancer. LKB1-deficient breast cancer cells display enhanced early tumor growth coupled increased cell migratory invasive properties vitro. show ErbB2-positive tumors deficient LKB1 display pro-growth molecular phenotypic signature characterized elevated Akt/mTOR signaling, increased glycolytic metabolism, well increased bioenergetic markers vitro vivo. also demonstrate mTOR contributes metabolic reprogramming LKB1-deficient breast cancer, required drive glycolytic metabolism tumors; however, LKB1-deficient breast cancer cells display reduced metabolic flexibility increased apoptosis response metabolic perturbations. CONCLUSIONS: Together, data suggest LKB1 functions tumor suppressor breast cancer. Loss LKB1 collaborates activated ErbB2 signaling drive breast tumorigenesis pro-growth metabolism resulting tumors.
