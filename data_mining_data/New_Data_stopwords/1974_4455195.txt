 1. Kinetics fructose 1,6-diphosphate activation liver pyruvate kinase type inhibited MgATP l-alanine described function enzyme fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations. results explained single pseudo-first-order transition enzyme active form, independent enzyme concentration. rate constant, k(app.)=0.24s(-1) 0.02mm-fructose 1,6-diphosphate (t(0.9) approximately 10s t(0.9) time 90% conversion), increasing function fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentration far beyond needed maximally activate enzyme equilibrated fructose 1,6-diphosphate (about 20mum). 2. model equations best analysed numerical techniques described. techniques useful studying similar slow transients frequently observed stopped-flow studies enzymes. 3. Shorter transients (t(0.9)=0.5-1.5s) observed kinetic response enzyme addition MgATP phosphoenolpyruvate, characterized.
