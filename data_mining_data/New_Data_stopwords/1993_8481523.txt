 point mutation (1277 CGG CAG) identified R-type pyruvate kinase (PK) cDNA PK variant, PK Sapporo, associated hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. mutation causes single amino acid substitution Arg Gln 426th amino acid residue human R-type PK; consequently, hydrophobicity around mutated site drastically decreased. amino acid change occurred eighth alpha helix domain (A alpha 8) PK, proposed region well alpha 7, beta 7, beta 8 potassium (K+) binding site. K+ binding PK subunit considered essential substrate binding, mutation might account decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). compatible fact reported PK variants carrying point mutations area high Michaelis constant (Km) PEP.
