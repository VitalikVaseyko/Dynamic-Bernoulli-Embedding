 binding pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component E1-specific kinase core-forming dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component facilitates severalfold enhancement rate kinase phosphorylate E1 (i.e. versus free kinase phosphorylating free E1). kinase E1 associate small exterior linker region-connected domains E2 structure. kinase binds one two lipoyl domains, E1 component binds domain E2"s structure lipoyl domain region inner domain. Sixty latter domains assemble form dodecahedron-shaped inner core. Binding kinase detached lipoyl domain region enhanced kinase activity. bi-lipoyl domain fragment induced 2-fold enhancement slow rate phosphorylation peptide substrate intact E260 gave 50% higher rate. contrast, lipoyl domain fragment gave 40% enhancement faster rate phosphorylation E1; whereas rate phosphorylation E1 markedly increased (4-10-fold depending conditions) kinase interaction intact E2 core. Binding E1 E2 structure lacking bi-lipoyl domain region enhance kinase activity. Thus, binding kinase lipoyl domain region elicits structural change enhances kinase activity; however, processes required explain large enhancement phosphorylation E1 effected intact E2 core. Among latter need mechanism allowing one kinase molecule phosphorylate many E1 tetramers, whereas E1 kinase stay bound oligomeric E2 core (i.e. phosphorylation appears much faster dissociation either kinase E1 tetramers E260 core). Exposure kinase bound lipoyl domain fragment intact E2 core 10 allowed transition maximal (7-fold) activation kinase. opposite direction, increasing level free bi-lipoyl domain fragment rapidly reduced, concentration-dependent manner activity kinase bound initially intact E2. data strongly support kinase transfer free lipoyl domains intact E2 core fit 12-fold tighter binding kinase intact E2 cores binding free lipoyl domains. interchange kinase E2 structures confirmed sucrose gradient studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
