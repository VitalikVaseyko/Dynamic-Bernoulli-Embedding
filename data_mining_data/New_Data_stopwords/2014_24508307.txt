 novel series bis-indoles derived naturally occurring marine alkaloid 4 synthesized evaluated inhibitors methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pyruvate kinase (PK). PK critical bacterial survival would make target development novel antibiotics, reported one highly connected 'hub proteins' MRSA, thus sensitive mutations making difficult bacteria develop resistance. co-crystal structure cis-3-4-dihydrohamacanthin B (4) bound S. aureus PK able identify pharmacophore needed activity. Consequently, prepared simple direct linked bis-indoles 10b similar anti-MRSA activity compound 4. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies carried 10b led us discover potent compounds 10c, 10d, 10k 10 enzyme inhibiting activities low nanomolar range effectively inhibited bacteria growth culture minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) MRSA low 0.5 mug/ml. potent PK inhibitors, 10b, exhibited attenuated antibacterial activity found substrates efflux mechanism S. aureus. Studies comparing wild type S. aureus construct (S. aureus LAC Deltapyk::Erm(R)) lacks PK activity confirmed bactericidal activity 10d PK-dependant.
