 review reports recent observations concerning specificities cellular energy metabolism cerebral tissues highlight characteristics glial tumours, association metabolic alterations aggressiveness tumours. Compared normal cerebral tissue, glial tissue exhibits relative independence towards oxygen substrate furnitures thus vascularization, well metabolic co-operation neurons glial cells within tumour. Occurrence Warburg effect could explain metabolic autonomy might associated genetic changes observed gliomas. Characteristics glycolytic metabolism within glioma tissue therefore may novel land therapeutic approaches treatment tumours.
