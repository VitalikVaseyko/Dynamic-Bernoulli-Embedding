 studied effect exogenous adenosine isolated perfused normoxic rat hearts glycolytic flux pyruvate kinase (PK). compared effect myxothiazol, inhibitor mitochondrial ATP production. Moreover, tested whether increase membrane ionic flux monensin linked stimulation glycolytic flux PK. 20-min stabilization period adenosine, myxothiazol monensin administrated perfusate continuously various concentrations 10 min. contraction monitored lactate production coronary effluents evaluated. amount adenine nucleotides phosphoenolpyruvate measured frozen hearts. Myxothiazol induced decrease left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP : -40%) together stimulation glycolytic flux secondary PK activation. contrast, adenosine primarily reduced heart rate (HR: -30%) marginal effects LVDP. associated inhibition glycolysis level PK. Na+ ionophore monensin affected HR (+14%) LVDP (+25%). effect associated stimulation glycolysis secondary stimulation PK. results provide new information action adenosine heart support concept direct coupling glycolysis process regulating sarcolemmal ionic fluxes.
