 Many extracellular signals stimulate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, turn activates Rac1 GTPase, protein kinase Akt Akt Thr 308 upstream kinase PDK1. Active Rac1 stimulates number events, including substrate phosphorylation subgroup PAK family kinases. combined effects Rac1, PDK1 Akt crucial cell migration, growth, survival, metabolism tumorigenesis. show Rac1 stimulates second, kinase-independent function PAK1. PAK1 kinase domain serves scaffold facilitate Akt stimulation PDK1 aid recruitment Akt membrane. PAK differentially activates subpopulations Akt. findings reveal scaffolding functions PAK regulate efficiency, localization specificity PDK1-Akt pathway.
