 Background: Culture media enrichment addition protein hydrolysates beneficial achieving higher protein expression. Methods: study, designing optimum mixture four soy casein-derived hydrolysates successfully performed design experiment specific productivity increased predicted combinations. Protein profile recombinant CHO (rCHO) cells producing tissue plasminogen activator serum-free medium (SFM) supplemented designed hydrolysate additives compared rCHO cells cultivated SFM. Results: Identification differentially expressed proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled MALDI-TOF/TOF revealed role energy metabolism related proteins importance prevention oxidative stress special media enrichment strategy. Up-regulation mitochondrial enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 Peroxiredoxin-III, well proteins involved metabolic pathways, uridine monophosphate/cytidine monophosphate kinase indicated higher metabolic activity. Furthermore, along antioxidant effect peptones, proteins antioxidant function ferritin peroxiredoxin-III up-regulated. Conclusion: Understanding molecular mechanisms involved enhancement protein expression provide new approaches efficiently engineering rCHO cell. results support competence proteomics studies finding new insights biochemical pathways knowledge-based optimization media compositions.
