 newly isolated peptide PHI provoked dose-dependent stimulation glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis isolated rat hepatocytes; 1 microM-PHI, processes increased 1.6-fold compared basal values. PHI-mediated effects accompanied activation glycogen phosphorylase inactivation pyruvate kinase. PHI (1 microM) also caused 2-fold increase hepatocyte cyclic AMP.
