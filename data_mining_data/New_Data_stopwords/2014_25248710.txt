 Tumor microenvironment closely related tumor progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) specialized fibroblasts domesticated cancer cells surrounding them. CAFs one important components cancer microenvironment. CAFs extensively involved tumor genesis, tumor invasion metastasis. Compared NFs, CAFs also different metabolism type. CAFs use glycolysis produce lactate cancer cells. is, CAFs turn metabolism type named "reverse Warburg effect" promote tumor progression. present study, summarized that: (1) Characteristics metabolic type CAFs; (2) research status metabolism CAFs; (3) potential mechanism CAFs metabolism; (4) relation metabolic alteration CAFs lung cancer progression; (5) Relationship CAFs metabolism lung cancer prognosis therapy.
