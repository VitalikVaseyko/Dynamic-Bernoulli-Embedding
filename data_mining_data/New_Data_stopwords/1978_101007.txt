 density distributions red cells sickle cell disorders hematological diseases determined. sickle cell anemia increase proportion cells heaviest lightest fractions. hemoglobin SC disease, small fraction shifted heavier cells. Sickle cell trait blood normal density pattern. hereditary spherocytosis increase number heavy cells observed. Thin-layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis red cell pyruvate kinase demonstrated pyruvate electrophoretic pattern related density distribution.
