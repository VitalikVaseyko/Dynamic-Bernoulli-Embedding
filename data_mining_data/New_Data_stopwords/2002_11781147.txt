 Genetic defects pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cause lactic acidosis, neurological deficits, often early death. mutations PDC localized alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. kinetically characterized patient's missense mutation alphaH44R E1alpha creating purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, alphaH44A). Substitutions histidine-15 resulted decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) increasing K(m) values thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). suggests volume residue site 15 important TPP binding substitution residue longer side chain disrupts active site TPP binding site. rates phosphorylation dephosphorylation alphaH44R E1 E1-kinase phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, similar wild-type E1 protein. results provide biochemical basis altered E1 function alphaH44R E1 patient.
