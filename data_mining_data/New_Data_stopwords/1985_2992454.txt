 Intact rat liver cells perivenous region isolated collagenase perfusion first destroying periportal region brief portal infusion digitonin. Periportal cells isolated retrograde digitonin infusion. Significantly higher alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase lactate dehydrogenase activities lower glutamate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activities periportal perivenous cells demonstrate marked separation. high yield allows characterization vitro cell populations.
