 compared microsomal protein composition eight malignant six benign adrenocortical tumors proteomic methods. IGF2 increased level malignant tumors, confirming previous microarray studies material. Aldolase A, glycolytic enzyme, also showed increased levels malignant tissue compared benign. Additionally, several proteins belonging complex mitochondrial respiration chain showed decreased levels malignant tissue. Taken together, may indicate shift energy metabolism glycolysis may favored tight coupling glycolysis mitochondrial respiration, phenomenon known Warburg effect. One complex proteins showed decreased levels malignant tissue GRIM-19. protein suggested tumor suppressive protein negative regulator STAT3. summary, analysis microsomal proteome adrenocortical tumors identifies groups proteins well specific proteins differentially expressed benign malignant forms. proteins shed light biology behind malignancy could delineate future drug targets.
