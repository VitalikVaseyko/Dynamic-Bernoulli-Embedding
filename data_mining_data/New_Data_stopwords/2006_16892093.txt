 Mitochondria vital cellular bioenergetics play central role determining point-of-no-return apoptotic process. consequence, mitochondria exert dual function carcinogenesis. Cancer-associated changes cellular metabolism (the Warburg effect) influence mitochondrial function, invalidation apoptosis linked inhibition mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). theoretical grounds, tempting develop specific therapeutic interventions target mitochondrial Achilles' heel, rendering cancer cells metabolically unviable subverting endogenous MOMP inhibitors. variety experimental therapeutic agents directly target mitochondria, causing apoptosis induction. applies heterogeneous collection chemically unrelated compounds including positively charged alpha-helical peptides, agents designed mimic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 Bcl-2-like proteins, ampholytic cations, metals steroid-like compounds. MOMP inducers facilitators induce apoptosis (monotherapy) facilitate apoptosis induction combination therapies, bypassing chemoresistance DNA-damaging agents. addition, possible design molecules neutralize inhibitor apoptosis proteins (IAPs) heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). IAP HSP70 inhibitors mimic action mitochondrion-derived mediators (Smac/DIABLO, is, second mitochondria-derived activator caspases/direct inhibitor apoptosis-binding protein low isoelectric point, case IAPs; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor, case HSP70) exert potent chemosensitizing effects.
