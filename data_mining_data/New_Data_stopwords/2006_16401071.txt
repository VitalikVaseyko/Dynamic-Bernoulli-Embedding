 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) regulates activity pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. PDHK inhibition provides route therapeutic intervention diabetes cardiovascular disorders. report crystal structures human PDHK isozyme 2 complexed physiological synthetic ligands. Several PDHK2 structures disclosed C-terminal cross arms span large trough region N-terminal regulatory (R) domains PDHK2 dimers. structures containing bound ATP ADP demonstrate variation conformation active site lid, residues 316-321, enclose nucleotide beta gamma phosphates active site C-terminal catalytic domain. identified three novel ligand binding sites located R domain PDHK2. Dichloroacetate (DCA) binds pyruvate binding site center R domain, together ADP, induces significant changes active site. Nov3r AZ12 inhibitors bind lipoamide binding site located one end R domain. Pfz3 (an allosteric inhibitor) binds extended site end R domain. conclude N-terminal domain PDHK key regulatory function propose different inhibitor classes act discrete mechanisms. structures describe provide insights used structure-based design PDHK inhibitors.
