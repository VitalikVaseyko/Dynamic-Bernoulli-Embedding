 phloem sap maize (Zea mays L.) leaves quarter total amino nitrogen found alanine, capacity de novo synthesis alanine 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) studied isolated bundle sheath (BS) strands maize. Inasmuch cells retained plasmodesmatic openings, possible study formation alanine 3-PGA glutamate ADP added. Alanine synthesis required existence intact cell structure. formation intermediates, partially released medium, activities enzymes reaction chain 3-PGA alanine could measured intact cells. results show BS cells rate alanine production pyruvate (0.5 micromole/minute per milligram BS chlorophyll) sufficient produce one-fourth assimilated nitrogen alanine. activity pyruvate kinase intact bundle sheath cells light found 0.2 micromole/minute per milligram BS chlorophyll, concluded light part conversion 3-PGA pyruvate may occur via pyruvate kinase reaction, via phosphoeno/pyruvate carboxylase, NADP-malate dehydrogenase, NADP-malic enzyme mesophyll BS cells.
