 BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinomas rare tumors indolent clinical course, frequent local relapses. identification tumors higher relapse risk seems interesting. Hence investigated parameters glucose metabolism, found associated poor prognosis malignancies. METHODS: Specimen 29 patients investigated immunohistochemically antibodies p-AKT, TKTL-1 (transketolase-like 1), M2PK (M2 pyruvate kinase), GLUT-1. Proliferation investigated staining Ki67. tumors located major minor salivary glands. typical cribriform subtype investigated. initial tumor stage pT1 pT2. RESULTS: Expression p-AKT significantly (P = 0.036) associated higher relapse risk multivariate analysis. Low expression M2PK non-significantly (P = 0.065) predictive higher risk. TKTL-1 GLUT-1 expressed majority cases, albeit associated relapse risk. CONCLUSION: Adenoid cystic carcinomas positive p-AKT show higher relapse risk. However, parameters glucose metabolism investigated proliferation (Ki67) predictive entity. findings demonstrate possible background therapeutic approaches targeting inhibition PI3K/AKT pathway.
