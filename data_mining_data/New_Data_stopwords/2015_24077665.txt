 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) plays important role aerobic glycolysis mediator Warburg effect tumors. previously thought tumor cells switch expression PKM normal tissue-expressed PKM1 tumor-specific PKM2 via alternative splicing mechanism. view challenged recent report demonstrating PKM2 already major PKM isoform expressed many differentiated normal tissues. Here, analyses sixteen tumor types using cancer genome atlas RNA-Seq exon array datasets, confirmed isoform switch PKM1 PKM2 occurred glioblastomas tumor types examined. Despite lacking isoform switches, PKM2 expression found increased cancer types examined, correlated strongly poor prognosis head neck cancers. demonstrated elevated PKM2 expression correlated well hypomethylation status intron 1 PKM gene multiple cancer types, suggesting epigenetic regulation DNA methylation major mechanism controlling PKM transcription tumors. study suggests isoform switch PKM1 PKM2 cancers tissue-specific targeting PKM2 activity tumors remains promising approach clinical intervention multiple cancer types.
