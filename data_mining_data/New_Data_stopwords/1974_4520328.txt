 Quantitative qualitative electron microscopic studies performed mitochondria leukemic myeloblasts 3 patients myeloblastic leukemia 3 patients myelomonoblastic leukemia. addition, confirm presence virus-like particles within mitochondria better understand interaction virus mitochondrion, rat embryo tissue culture infected MSV-MLV (Moloney sarcoma virus-Moloney leukemia virus) selected detailed electron microscopic examination. Significant quantitative differences normal leukemic human mitochondria observed. However, qualitative abnormalities found human leukemic mitochondria tissue culture material. abnormalities included variable forms leukemic mitochondria (twisted, tear-drop irregular shapes), fewer cristae, disrupted mitochondria virus-like particles, smaller granules greater abundance, mitochondrial DNA, contact mitochondrion nucleus. tissue culture material revealed similar changes, showed virus particles located outside cells, intracytoplasmic sacs within mitochondria. addition two striking features observed tissue culture material seen human material: a) Budding outer mitochondrial membrane mitochondrial matrix b) virus particles attached cristae. Since mitochondria important organelles glycolytic-oxidative phosphorylation pathways, perhaps us engaged cancer research take closer look Warburg effect carefully consider extranuclear factors operating oncogenesis.
