 concentration various substances measured renal cardiac lymph arterial venous plasma determine lymph constituents might indicate events occurring cellular level two organs. study utilized anesthetized dogs. Magnesium, calcium, pyruvate glucose concentrations similar four fluids. Cardiac lymph contained significantly higher concentrations creatine phosphokinase, lactic dehydrogenase lactate. Renal lymph contained lower concentrations zinc protein renal cardiac lymph contained less copper arterial plasma. Venous plasma contained copper fluids. concluded lymph composition reflects events occurring cells, especially substances readily diffusable blood capillary endothelium.
