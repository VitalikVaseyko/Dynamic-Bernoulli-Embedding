 Pyruvate dehydrogenase A1 (PDHA1) serves gate-keeper enzyme link glycolysis mitochondrial citric acid cycle. inhibition PDHA1 cancer cells result increased Warburg effect aggressive phenotype cancer cells. study conducted investigate expression PDHA1 ovarian cancer correlation PDHA1 expression prognosis patients. PDHA1 protein expression 3 ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3, SKOV-3 ES-2) 248 surgically removed ovarian carcinoma samples immunocytochemically examined. Statistical analyses performed evaluate correlations PDHA1 expression clinicopathological characteristics patients well predictive value PDHA1. results showed presence variable expression PDHA1 three ovarian cancer cell lines. 248 ovarian cancer tissue specimens, 45 cases (18.1%) negative tumor cells PDHA1, 162 cases (65.3%) displayed low expression level, 41 cases (16.5%) relatively high PDHA1 staining. expression PDHA1 associated histological subtype (P=0.004) FIGO stage (P=0.002). median OS time PDHA1 negative group, low expression group high expression group 0.939 years, 1.443 years 9.900 years, respectively. median PFS time three groups 0.287 years, 0.586 years 9.900 years, respectively. Furthermore, high expression PDHA1 ovarian carcinoma cells significantly associated better OS PFS statistical analyses. Multivariate analyses showed PDHA1 expression also independent prognostic factor higher OS ovarian cancer patients (HR=0.705, 95% CI 0.541-0.918, P=0.01). study indicated decreased expression PDHA1 might independent prognostic factor unfavorable outcomes.
