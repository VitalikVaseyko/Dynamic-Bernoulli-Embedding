 autotroph Methanococcus maripaludis contained high levels acetate-coenzyme ligase, pyruvate synthase, pyruvate, water dikinase, pyruvate carboxylase, enzymes incomplete reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase detected. contrast, heterotroph Methanococcus sp. strain A3 contained acetate kinase, acetate coenzyme ligase virtually absent.
