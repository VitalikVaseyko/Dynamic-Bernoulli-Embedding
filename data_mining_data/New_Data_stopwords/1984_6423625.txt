 2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol (100 200 mg/kg) decreased blood glucose 17 58% fasting mice, rats, streptozotocin-diabetic mice, genetically diabetic db/db mice. Serum lactate rats elevated 56% 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol, could prevented dichloroacetate (200 mg/kg) thiamin (200 mg/kg). hepatocytes fasted rats, 1 mM 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol inhibited gluconeogenesis mixture alanine, lactate, pyruvate. also inhibited glucose production stimulated lactate formation glycerol dihydroxyacetone. Glycogenolysis hepatocytes fed rats markedly inhibited 1 mM 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol presence absence 1 microM glucagon. 2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol phosphorylated fructokinase hexokinase 1-phosphate phosphofructokinase 1,6-bisphosphate. Rat liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibited 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1-phosphate (apparent Ki = 0.66 +/- 0.09 mM) little affected 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate. Rat liver phosphoglucomutase inhibited 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1-phosphate (apparent Ki = 2.8 +/- 0.2 mM), whereas 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate served alternative activator (apparent K alpha = 7.0 +/- 0.5 microM). Rabbit liver pyruvate kinase activated 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate (apparent K alpha = 9.5 +/- 0.9 microM), whereas rabbit liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase inhibited 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate (apparent Ki = 3.6 +/- 0.3 microM). phosphate esters 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol would, therefore, expected inhibit glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis stimulate glycolysis liver.
