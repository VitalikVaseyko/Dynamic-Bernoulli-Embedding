 Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase found irreversibly inactivated butanedione dark. second-order rate constants inactivation pH 8.0 25 degrees C 2.14 2.74 M-1 min-1 absence presence 50 mM borate, respectively. pH profile inactivation indicated involvement residue apparent pK alpha 8.1-8.3. ADP phosphoenolpyruvate acted partial inhibitors inactivation process. Certain details inactivation, spectral studies, fluorometric determinations gave evidence arginine target residue. total 23 +/- 3 residues per subunit modified within period required inactivation. period presence 4 mM ADP reduced extent inactivation 70% number modified residues 18 +/- 4. number arginine residues protected ADP butanedione modification 5.0 +/- 1.3 per subunit.
