 1. Pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glucophosphate isomerase activities measured liver, heart gastrocnemius Wistar Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. Enzyme activities significantly lower tissues Wistar rats except pyruvate kinase gastrocnemius. 3. Sensitivities pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase inhibition alanine citrate differed two strains except pyruvate kinase gastrocnemius. 4. Phosphofructokinase sensitivity citrate greater three Wistar tissues. 5. Activities liver enzymes responsive high sucrose diet Wistar rats. 6. Heart pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase exhibited modest increases activity high sucrose diet.
