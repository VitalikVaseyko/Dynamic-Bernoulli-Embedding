 Many mammalian cell lines used manufacturing biopharmaceuticals exhibit high glycolytic flux predominantly channeled production lactate. accumulation lactate culture reduces cell viability may also decrease product quality. work, engineered HEK 293 derived cell line producing recombinant gene therapy retroviral vector, down-regulating hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Specific productivity infectious viral titers could increased 20-fold single gene knock-down (HIF1 PDK) 30-fold combined down-regulation. Lactate production reduced 4-fold. However, reduction lactate production, alone, sufficient enhance titer: high-titer clones also showed significant enrollment metabolic routes related lactate production. Transcriptome analysis indicated activation biological amines metabolism, detoxification routes, including glutathione metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen biosynthesis amino acid catabolism. latter validated enzyme activity assays metabolite profiling, respectively. High-titer clones also presented substantially increased transcript levels viral genes expression cassettes. results herein presented demonstrate impact HIF1 PDK down-regulation production performance mammalian cell line, reporting one highest fold-increase specific productivity infectious virus titers achieved metabolic engineering. additionally highlight contribution secondary pathways, beyond related lactate production, also explored pursue improved metabolic status favoring high-producing phenotype.
