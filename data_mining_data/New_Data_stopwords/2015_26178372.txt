 Decidualization essential process maternal endometrial stromal cells support pregnancy. Although known enhanced glucose influx critical decidualization, underlying mechanism regulating glucose metabolism decidua remains insufficiently understood. Here, demonstrate aerobic glycolysis-related genes factors substantially induced decidualization, indicating existence Warburg-like glycolysis decidua. vitro, progesterone activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif1alpha) c-Myc Pi3k-Akt signaling pathway maintain aerobic glycolysis decidualizing cells. Knocking pyruvate kinase M2 (Pkm2) attenuates induction decidual marker gene. Decidual formation vivo also impaired glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate. Besides, lactate exporter monocarboxylate transporter 4 (Mct4) induced newly formed decidual cells, whereas lactate importer Mct1 proliferation marker Ki-67 complementarily located surrounding undifferentiated cells, supposed consume lactate proliferation. Hif1alpha activation required lactate-dependent proliferation undifferentiated cells. Inhibition lactate flux leads compromised decidualization decelerated lactate-dependent proliferation. summary, reveal Warburg-like glycolysis local lactate shuttle activated decidua play important roles supporting early pregnancy.
