 proportion pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex active dephosphorylated form decreased (compared fed lean control mice) heart muscle mitochondria induction obesity gold-thioglucose (by 54%) starvation lean mice 48 h (by 81%). effects obesity inactivate PDH complex demonstrable 4 weeks administration gold-thioglucose, occurred despite significant hyperinsulinaemia obese animals. Phosphorylation inactivation PDH complex mouse heart muscle starvation attributed stable increase (2.7-fold) activity PDH kinase measured extracts mitochondria mediated increased specific activity protein activator PDH kinase (KAP) [Denyer, Kerbey & Randle (1986) Biochem. J. 239, 347-354]. obese mice increase kinase activity observed, conclude phosphorylation inactivation PDH complex heart muscle obesity mediated KAP, rather consequence increased lipid oxidation.
