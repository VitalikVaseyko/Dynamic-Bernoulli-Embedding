 gated high-energy nucleotides, cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels exquisitely sensitive changes cellular energy metabolism. emerging view proteins associated K(ATP) channel provide additional layer regulation. Using putative sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) coiled-coil domains baits 2-hybrid screen rat cardiac cDNA library, identified glycolytic enzymes (GAPDH aldolase A) putative interacting proteins. Interaction aldolase SUR confirmed using GST pulldown assays coimmunoprecipitation assays. Mass spectrometry proteins K(ATP) channel immunoprecipitates rat cardiac membranes identified glycolysis enriched biological process. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed interaction several glycolytic enzymes throughout glycolytic pathway. Immunocytochemistry colocalized many enzymes K(ATP) channel subunits rat cardiac myocytes. catalytic activities aldolase pyruvate kinase functionally modulate K(ATP) channels patch-clamp experiments, whereas D-glucose without effect. Overall, data demonstrate close physical association functional interaction glycolytic process (particularly distal ATP-generating steps) cardiac K(ATP) channels.
