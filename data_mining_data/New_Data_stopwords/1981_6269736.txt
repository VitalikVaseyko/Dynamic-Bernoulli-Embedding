 Enzyme deviation patterns examined primary rat hepatomas induced short-term sequential administration two chemical carcinogens among 2-fluorenylacetamide (FAA), diethylnitrosamine (DENA), 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) FAA 3'-Me-DAB followed phenobarbital promoter. purpose discern patterns influenced different administration schedules carcinogens two carcinogens sequence affects pattern more. Biochemical differentiation hyperplastic hepatic nodules hepatomas determined simultaneous assays activities isozyme composition glucose-adenosine triphosphate phosphotransferase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase consideration histological classification nodules tumors. Poorly differentiated hepatomas predominantly induced 3'-Me-DAB followed FAA DENA except hepatomas induced 3'-Me-DAB followed phenobarbital, mainly well moderately differentiated; well moderately differentiated hepatomas predominantly induced FAA followed 3'-Me-DAB phenobarbital. degree enzyme deviation hepatomas induced DENA first carcinogen intermediate hepatomas induced FAA 3'-Me-DAB, although degree tended increase increased dose term DENA. results indicate deviations enzymes, pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, well histological differentiation primary hepatomas strongly influenced first carcinogen second administration schedules degree enzyme deviation shown hepatomas produced particular carcinogen treatment regimen principally related potential regimen induce anaplastic tumors.
