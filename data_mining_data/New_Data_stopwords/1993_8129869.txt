 new method quantitative estimation surrounding hydrophobicity residues proteins proposed. based formalism three-dimensional molecular hydrophobicity potential (3D MHP) includes calculation 3D MHP created atoms system "molecule+surrounding water". calculated 3D MHP geometrical centers residues 23 proteins (from Protein Data Bank) surrounded water layers 12-15 thick. data, plotted along protein sequence (1D MHP profiles) contain comprehensive information protein, water, prosthetic groups neighbouring domains contributions residue environment. 1D MHP profiles generated water molecules strongly correlate standard accessibility profiles based calculations exposed surface areas. results confirm recently observed interrelation resonance Raman cross sections tryptophan residues polarity microenvironment. 3D MHP contributions (and related 1D MHP profiles) residue environment protein atoms, heme myoglobin, flavin flavodoxin well neighbouring domains pyruvate kinase characterized. 3D MHP data rubredoxin native totally extended conformations reveal striking deviations reflecting influence long-range interactions residues far removed sequence. Statistical analysis 3D MHP data yields new hydrophobicity scale (MHPS) correlates several commonly used scales obtained variety complementary techniques.
