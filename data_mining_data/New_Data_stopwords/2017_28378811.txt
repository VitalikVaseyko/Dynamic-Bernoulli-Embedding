 Chemoresistance cisplatin principal cause treatment failure mortality advanced bladder cancer (BC). underlying mechanisms remain unclear, hinders development preventive strategies. Recent data indicate pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), glycolytic enzyme Warburg effect, strongly upregulated BC. study explores role PKM2 chemoresistance whether inhibiting PKM2 augments chemosensitivity cisplatin reduces BC growth progression. found Shikonin binds PKM2 inhibits BC cell survival dose-dependent pyruvate kinase activity-independent manner. Down-regulation PKM2 shRNA blunts cellular responses shikonin enhances responses cisplatin. Shikonin cisplatin together exhibit significantly greater inhibition proliferation apoptosis used alone. Induced cisplatin-resistance strongly associated PKM2 overexpression, cisplatin-resistant cells respond sensitively shikonin. syngeneic mice, shikonin cisplatin together, single-agents, markedly reduces BC growth metastasis. Based data, conclude PKM2 overexpression key mechanism chemoresistance advanced BC cisplatin. Inhibition PKM2 via RNAi chemical inhibitors may highly effective approach overcome chemoresistance improve outcome advanced BC.
