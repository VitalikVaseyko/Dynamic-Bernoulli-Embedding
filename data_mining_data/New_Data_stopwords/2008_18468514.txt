 Glucose powerful effects gene expression participates fasted-to-fed transition liver. However, molecular mechanism glucose-regulated gene expression completely described. present study, performed detailed analysis molecular events insulin-independent glucose response liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. L-PK mRNA increased glucose transcriptional level determined real-time RT-PCR, mRNA stability measurements, nuclear run-on assays. LY294002 LY303511 inhibited glucose response L-PK gene transcriptional level. Histones H3 H4 associated L-PK gene promoter hyperacetylated HNF4alpha constitutively bound low high glucose. Treatment 20mM glucose increased recruitment ChREBP, additional HNF4alpha, RNA polymerase II. Glucose-stimulated phosphorylation C-terminal domain RNA polymerase II, increased Ser5 phosphorylation near transcription start site increased Ser2 phosphorylation near termination signal. LY294002 LY303511 blocked recruitment RNA polymerase II L-PK gene, reducing rate transcription. results studies demonstrate fundamental details molecular mechanism glucose activated gene expression.
