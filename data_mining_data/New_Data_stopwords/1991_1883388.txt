 Using T7 expression system, monomer rat pituitary pyruvate kinase, subtype M1 (PKM1), overexpressed Escherichia coli purified homogeneity. monomeric p58-M1 intrinsic enzymatic activity Vmax 79 +/- 20 units/mg Km's ADP PEP 1.43 +/- 0.76 0.14 +/- 0.07 mM, respectively. monomer binds 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) Ka = 1.5 x 10(7) M-1. order analog specificity L-T3 greater L-thyroxine greater D-T3 greater 3'-isopropyl-3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine greater equal 3',5',3-triiodo-L-thyronine. contrast, tetrameric PKM1 lacks T3 binding activity. kinase activity p58-M1 inhibited T3 analogs concentration-dependent manner order inhibitory activity similar binding activity. inhibition, however, reversed addition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. p58-M1 second PK isoenzyme monomer identified thyroid hormone binding activity.
