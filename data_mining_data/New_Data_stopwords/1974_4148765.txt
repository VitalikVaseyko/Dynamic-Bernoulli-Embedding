 Mutants requiring threonine plus methionine (or homoserine), threonine plus methionine plus diaminopimelate (or homoserine plus diaminopimelate) isolated strains possessing one three isofunctional aspartokinases. classified several groups according enzymatic defects. mapping described. Several regions chromosome concerned: thrA (aspartokinase I-homoserine dehydrogenase I) mapped region thrB thrC (0 min). lysC (aspartokinase III) mapped 80 min, far genes coding diaminopimelate synthesis. metLM (aspartokinase II-homoserine dehydrogenase II) lies 78 min closely linked metB, metJ, metF.
