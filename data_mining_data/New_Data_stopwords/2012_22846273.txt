 Lung cancer one prevalent deadly cancers United States. Research shown cancer cells exhibit higher glycolytic rates normal cells. attempting exploit unique cancer-dependent ATP generation phenomenon (Warburg effect), hypothesize exposure cancer cells organic inhibitors glycolysis would negative impact survival alter growth viability due vast decrease essential glycolytic ATP production resultant energetic collapse negative consequences seen normal lung cells. human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 used study models normal lung lung cancer vitro. Using standard methods, cell lines maintained exposed oxalic acid zinc acetate reagents concentration levels ranging 31.3-2,000 microg/ml 96 well plates quadruplets experiments repeated least three times using MTT, cell counting (T4 Cellometer) assays well phase-contrast photo-imaging. results indicate exposure cell lines organics resulted concentration dependent cell destruction/cell survival depending cell line exposed. Oxalic acid zinc acetate showed statistically significant (p<0.05) differential negative effects A549 line comparison unexposed control well effects MRC-5 cell line, presenting promising indicators cancer therapeutic potential.
