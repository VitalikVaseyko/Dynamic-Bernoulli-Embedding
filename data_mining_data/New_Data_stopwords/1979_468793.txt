 regulation pyruvate kinase isolated hepatocytes fasted rats studied intracellular level fructose 1,6-bisphosphate elevated 5-fold addition 5 mM dihydroxyacetone. case, flux pyruvate kinase increased. increase flux correlated elevation fructose bisphosphate levels P-enolpyruvate levels unchanged. Pyruvate kinase activated affinity P-enolpyruvate increased 7-fold hepatocyte homogenates. Precipitation enzyme homogenates ammonium sulfate removed fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activation longer observed. results indicate flux activity pyruvate kinase controlled intracellular level fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. effect elevated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels ability glucagon inactivate pyruvate kinase also studied covalent enzyme modification observed. Inactivation maximally effective hormone concentrations unaffected elevated levels fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, half-maximally effective concentration increased 0.3 0.8 nM. Activation cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase 0.3 nM glucagon unaffected, initial rate pyruvate kinase inactivation suppressed. results suggest alterations level fructose 1,6-bisphosphate affect ability physiological concentrations glucagon inactivate pyruvate kinase opposing phosphorylation enzyme. Consistent view finding physiological concentrations fructose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibited vitro phosphorylation purified pyruvate kinase. Inactivation pyruvate kinase 0.3 nM glucagon 1 microM phenylephrine also suppressed 10 nM insulin. Insulin act increasing fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels. antagonism glucagon correlated well ability insulin suppress activation cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. However, correlation observed phenylephrine absence presence insulin. Thus, insulin enhance pyruvate kinase activity cyclic AMP-dependent independent mechanisms.
