 OBJECTIVE: explore role PDK1 T-ALL development establishing Notch1-induced T-ALL mouse model using Mx1-cre; LoxP system knock-out PDK1. METHODS: Cell cycle apoptosis leukemic cells detected flow cytometry, relative expression tumor-related genes transcription factors leukemic cells determined quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Notch1-induced T-ALL mouse model inducible knock-out PDK1 established successfully. Compared T-ALL control mouse model, PDK1 knock-out mice showed significant longer survival time (P<0.01). difference cell cycle control PDK1 knock-out mice, apoptosis rate leukemic cells PDK1 knock-out mice higher control mice (P<0.001). PDK1 knock-out resulted decreased expression tumor-related genes transcription factors, c-Myc NF-kappaB (P<0.01), increased expression level P53 (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: PDK1 knock-out inhibit development T-ALL, mechanism may leukemia progression inhibited regulating apoptosis expression multiple related genes transcription factors.
