 Almost invasive cancers, regardless tissue origin, characterized specific modifications cellular energy metabolism. fact, strong predominance aerobic glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect) usually associated aggressive tumour phenotypes. metabolic shift offers survival advantage cancer cells, since may continue produce energy anabolites even exposed either transient permanent hypoxic conditions. Moreover, ensures high production rate glycolysis intermediates, useful building blocks fast cell proliferation cancer cells. peculiar metabolic profile may constitute ideal target therapeutic interventions selectively hit cancer cells minimal residual systemic toxicity. review provide update recent advances discovery new bioactive molecules able interfere cancer glycolysis.
