 Sterile inflammation tissue damage ubiquitous response, yet highest amplitude liver. major clinical consequences, alcoholic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH NASH) account majority liver disease industrialized countries lack therapy. Requirements sustained sterile inflammation include increased oxidative stress activation HIF-1alpha signaling pathway. demonstrate ability digoxin, cardiac glycoside, protect liver inflammation damage ASH NASH. Digoxin effective maintaining cellular redox homeostasis suppressing HIF-1alpha pathway activation. proteomic screen revealed digoxin binds pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), independently PKM2 kinase activity results chromatin remodeling downregulation HIF-1alpha transactivation. data identify PKM2 mediator therapeutic target regulating liver sterile inflammation, demonstrate novel role digoxin effectively protect liver ASH NASH.
