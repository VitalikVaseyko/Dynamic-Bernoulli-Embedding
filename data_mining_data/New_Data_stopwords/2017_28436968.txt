 hallmark cancer cells metabolic switch oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis, phenomenon referred 'Warburg effect', also observed primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, report downregulation SIRT2 upregulation SIRT1 molecular signature primed hPSCs SIRT2 critically regulates metabolic reprogramming induced pluripotency targeting glycolytic enzymes including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase. Remarkably, knockdown SIRT2 human fibroblasts resulted significantly decreased OXPHOS increased glycolysis. addition, found miR-200c-5p specifically targets SIRT2, downregulating expression. Furthermore, SIRT2 overexpression hPSCs significantly affected energy metabolism, altering stem cell functions pluripotent differentiation properties. Taken together, results identify miR-200c-SIRT2 axis key regulator metabolic reprogramming (Warburg-like effect), via regulation glycolytic enzymes, human induced pluripotency pluripotent stem cell function.
