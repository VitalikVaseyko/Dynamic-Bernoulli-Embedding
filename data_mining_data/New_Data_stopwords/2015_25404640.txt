 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) pivotal enzyme cellular energy metabolism previously implicated cancer RNAi based studies clinical correlations poor prognosis several cancer types. Here, report discovery novel selective ATP competitive pan-isoform inhibitor PDK, VER-246608. Consistent PDK mediated MOA, VER-246608 increased pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, oxygen consumption attenuated glycolytic activity. However, effects observed D-glucose-depleted conditions required almost complete ablation PDC E1alpha subunit phosphorylation. VER-246608 weakly anti-proliferative cancer cells standard culture media; however, depletion either serum combined D-glucose/L-glutamine resulted enhanced cellular potency. Furthermore, condition-selective cytostatic effect correlated reduced intracellular pyruvate levels attenuated compensatory response involving deamination L-alanine. addition, VER-246608 found potentiate activity doxorubicin. contrast, lipoamide site inhibitor, Nov3r, demonstrated sub-maximal inhibition PDK activity evidence cellular activity. studies suggest PDK inhibition may effective nutrient-depleted conditions found tumour microenvironment combination treatments explored reveal full potential therapeutic strategy.
