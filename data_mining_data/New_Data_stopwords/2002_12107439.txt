 Haplotype diversity genomic region approximately 70 kb 1q21 genes PKLR GBA characterized typing one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) PKLR, two SNPs GBA one short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) PKLR 1792 chromosomes 17 worldwide populations. Two SNPs GBA typed three African populations. chromosomes carried one either two phylogenetically distinct haplotypes different alleles site. Allele diversity STRP tightly linked haplotype background. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) highly significant SNP pairs populations, although was, average, slightly higher non-African populations sub-Saharan Africans. Variation PKLR-GBA also tightly linked GBA pseudogene, 16 kb downstream GBA. Thus, 90 kb-long LD block observed, points low recombination rate region. Detailed haplotype phylogeny suggests chimpanzee GBA haplotype one two frequent haplotypes. Based variability PKLR STRP geographical distribution LD, expansion two main haplotypes may predated "Out Africa" expansion anatomically modern humans. LD STRP variability non-Africans approximately 87% Africans, contrast loci; implies "out Africa" bottleneck may broad distribution effects across loci.
