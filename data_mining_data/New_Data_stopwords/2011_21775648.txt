 Exercise acute hypoxia elicits large increase blood lactate concentration ([La](b)) compared normoxic exercise. However, several studies humans show transition chronic hypoxia, exercise [La](b) returns normoxic levels. Although extensively examined last decades, muscle-specific mechanisms responsible phenomenon remain unknown. assess changes skeletal muscle associated transition acute chronic hypoxia, CD-1 mice exposed 24 h (24H), 1 wk (1WH), 4 wk (4WH) hypobaric hypoxia (equivalent 4,300 m), exercised 12% O(2), compared normoxic mice (N) 21% O(2). Since enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) plays major role metabolic fate pyruvate (oxidation vs. lactate production), assessed changes activity regulation. report run hypoxia, 24H mice exhibited highest blood intramuscular lactate groups, 1WH group approached N group values. Concomitantly, 24H group exhibited lowest PDH activity, associated higher phosphorylation (inactive) state Ser(232) residue PDH, site specific PDH kinase-1 (PDK1). Furthermore, protein levels PDK1 regulator, hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), elevated 24H group compared N 1WH groups. Overall, results point novel mechanism muscle HIF-1alpha pathway desensitized transition acute chronic hypoxia, leading reestablishment PDH activity reduction lactate production exercising muscles.
