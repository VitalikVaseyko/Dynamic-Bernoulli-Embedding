 Implantation Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepatoma rats resulted decrease muscle weight 7 days inoculation tumor. changes associated increases mRNA content peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma PPAR delta skeletal muscle. increase gene expression transcription factors related increases expression several genes involved fatty acid transport, activation, oxidation. Tumor burden also resulted increases PPAR gamma coactivator-1 alpha gene expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. changes lipid metabolism genes suggest metabolic shift occurs skeletal muscle tumor-bearing rats toward oxidative phenotype. Formoterol treatment tumor-bearing rats resulted amelioration changes observed result tumor burden. Administration beta(2)-adrenergic agonist also resulted decrease mRNA content muscle PPAR alpha, PPAR delta, PPAR gamma, well mRNA levels many genes involved lipid mitochondrial metabolism. results suggest involvement different PPARs transcription factors related muscle wasting also indicate possible mode action anticachectic compound formoterol may involve normalization levels transcription factors.
