 Although "Warburg effect", i.e., elevated glucose metabolism lactic acid (glycolysis) even presence oxygen, recognized common biochemical phenotype cancer 80 years, biochemical genetic basis remained unknown 50 years. Work focused elucidating underlying mechanism(s) "Warburg effect" commenced author's laboratory 1969. 1985 among novel findings made two related directly basis "Warburg effect", first mitochondrial content tumors exhibiting phenotype markedly decreased relative tissue origin, second mitochondria markedly elevated amounts enzyme hexokinase-2 (HK2) bound outer membrane. HK2 first number enzymes cancer cells involved metabolizing sugar glucose lactic acid. mitochondrial location HK2 binds at/near protein VDAC (voltage dependent anion channel), escapes inhibition product glucose-6-phosphate, gains access mitochondrial produced ATP. shown others, also helps immortalize cancer cells, i.e., prevents cell death. Based studies, author's laboratory commenced experiments elucidate gene basis overexpression HK2 cancer. studies led discovery unique HK2 promoter region markedly activated hypoxic conditions moderately activated several metabolites (e.g., glucose), Also discovered promoter's regulation epigenetic events (i.e., methylation, demethylation). Finally, author's laboratory turned important objective. Could selectively completely destroy cancerous tumors animals? led discovery experiment conceived, designed, conducted Young Ko small molecule 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), subject mini-review series, incredibly powerful swift acting anticancer agent. Significantly, subsequent experiments rodents (19 animals advanced cancer) Ko led project 3BP shown short treatment period eradicate (100%). Ko's co-author's findings published attracted global attention leading world-wide many studies publications related 3BP potent anti-cancer effect. Issue Journal Bioenergetics Biomembranes (JOBB 44-1) captures sampling research conducted date 3BP anticancer agent, includes also Case Report first human patient known author treated specially formulated 3BP. Suffice say bottom line, "3BP, small molecule, results remarkable therapeutic effect comes treating cancers exhibiting "Warburg effect". includes cancer types.
