 OBJECTIVE: compare mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) fibroblasts Doberman Pinschers without dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutation gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) evaluate vitro whether treatment adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (i.e., gene therapy) would alter metabolic efficiency. ANIMALS: 10 Doberman Pinschers screened DCM PDK4 mutation. PROCEDURES Fibroblasts harvested skin biopsy specimens obtained Doberman Pinschers, dogs classified without DCM PDK4 mutation (n = 3) occult DCM heterozygous (4) homozygous (3) PDK4 mutation. Fibroblasts treated tyrosine mutant AAV type 2 vector containing PDK4 multiplicities infection 1,000. Mitochondrial OCR measured evaluate mitochondrial metabolism. OCR compared among dog groups untreated treated fibroblasts within groups. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD basal OCR fibroblasts heterozygous (74 +/- 8 pmol O2/min) homozygous (58 +/- 12 pmol O2/min) dogs significantly lower dogs without PDK4 mutation (115 +/- 9 pmol O2/min). AAV transduction, OCR increase significantly group (mutation-free group, 121 +/- 26 pmol O2/min; heterozygous group, 88 +/- 6 pmol O2/min; homozygous group, 59 +/- 3 pmol O2/min). CONCLUSIONS CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mitochondrial function altered skin fibroblasts Doberman Pinschers DCM PDK4 mutation. Change mitochondrial function vitro gene therapy multiplicities infection used study significant.
