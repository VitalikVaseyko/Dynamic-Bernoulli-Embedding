 Protein kinase activities detected cell-free extracts B385 derivative Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2); least 12 polypeptides, ranging Mr 6,000 98,000, detectably phosphorylated, probably O-monoesters, incubation gamma [32P]ATP. culture stage mycelia used production cell-free extracts determined profile phosphorylated polypeptides. Phosphoenol pyruvate acted potent modulator apparent degree protein kinase activity. addition Ca2+ ions, verapamil, chlorpromazine anti-calmodulin antiserum specific effects profile phosphopolypeptides observed.
