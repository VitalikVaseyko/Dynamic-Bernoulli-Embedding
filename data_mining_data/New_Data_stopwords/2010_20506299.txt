 Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negative regulator insulin tyrosine kinase growth factor signaling. recently demonstrated PTP1B deficiency increases GLUT2/insulin receptor (IR) complexes glucose uptake suckling, adult, primary hepatocytes. Herein investigated intrahepatic glucose utilization 3-5 days old wild-type PTP1B(-/-) mice. PTP1B deficiency decreased glycogen, lactate, pyruvate content livers suckling mice. Conversely, activity glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), rate limiting enzyme pentose phosphate cycle (PPC) provides substrates DNA synthesis, enhanced liver PTP1B(-/-) animals. Liver weight, liver-to-body mass ratio, DNA content, PCNA expression increased PTP1B(-/-) suckling mice compared wild-type controls. molecular level, STAT 5B phosphorylation, IGF-I mRNA, protein levels well IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation increased livers PTP1B-deficient neonates. Unexpectedly, hepatic serum triglycerides (TG) increased PTP1B deficiency, although expression lipogenic enzymes remained wild-type controls. However, analysis milk composition revealed higher TG content lactating females lacking PTP1B. effects PTP1B deficiency G6PD activity, STAT 5B/IGF-I/IGF-IR axis, PCNA expression liver growth suckling maintained transferring PTP1B(-/-) embryos (PTP1B(-/-T)) wild-type female. Conversely, PTP1B(-/-T) mice show hepatic fat accumulation. conclusion, present study suggests PTP1B plays unique role control physiological liver development birth.
