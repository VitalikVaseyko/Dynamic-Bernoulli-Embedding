 PURPOSE: aim study explore relationships M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) sensitivity human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells docetaxel vitro. MATERIALS METHODS: method plasmid transfection, silenced expression PKM2 successfully A549 H460 cells. Western blotting real-time PCR applied detect PKM2 expression protein gene levels. Cell viability examined CCK8 assay. Cell cycle distribution apoptosis examined flow cytometry. P21 Bax detected. RESULTS: Expression PKM2 mRNA protein significantly decreased shRNA targeting PKM2. Silencing PKM2 increased docetaxel sensitivity human NSCLC A549 H460 cells collaborative manner, resulting strong suppression cell viability. results flow cytometric assays suggested knockdown PKM2 docetaxel treatment, whether used singly combination, blocked cells G2/M phase, consistent effect two expression p21. Cells PKM2 silencing likely induced apoptosis docetaxel although knockdown PKM2 alone can't induce apoptosis significantly, consistent effect two Bax expression. CONCLUSION: results suggest PKM2 knockdown could serve chemosensitizer docetaxel non-small lung cancer cells targeting PKM2, leading inhibition cell viability, increase cell arrest G2/M phase apoptosis.
