 Cellular energy metabolism one main processes affected transition normal cancer cells, crucial determinant cell proliferation cell death. support rapid proliferation, cancer cells choose use glycolysis even presence oxygen (Warburg effect) fuel macromolecules synthesis nucleotides, fatty acids, amino acids accelerated mitosis, rather fuel tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria biogenesis also reprogrammed cancer cells, destiny cells determined balance energy macromolecule supplies, efficiency buffering cumulative radical oxygen species. glioblastoma, frequent malignant adult brain tumor, metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis observed, regulation well known genes integrants oncogenic pathways phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase, MYC, hypoxia regulated gene hypoxia induced factor 1. expression profile set genes coding glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle glioblastoma cases confirms metabolic switch. understanding main metabolic pathways modified cancer cells interactions oncogenes tumor suppressor genes pathways may enlighten new strategies cancer therapy. present review, main metabolic pathways compared normal cancer cells, key regulations main oncogenes tumor suppressor genes discussed. Potential therapeutic targets cancer energetic metabolism enumerated, highlighting astrocytomas, common brain cancer.
