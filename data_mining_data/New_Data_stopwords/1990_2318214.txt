 quantitative importance glycolysis cardiomyocyte reenergization contractile recovery examined postischemic, preload-controlled, isolated working guinea pig hearts. 25-min global low-flow ischemia concurrent norepinephrine infusion exhaust cellular glycogen stores followed 15-min reperfusion. 5 mM pyruvate sole reperfusion substrate, severe contractile failure developed despite normal sarcolemmal pyruvate transport rate high intracellular pyruvate concentrations near 2 mM. Reperfusion dysfunction characterized low cytosolic phosphorylation potential [( ATP]/[( ADP][Pi]) due accumulations inorganic phosphate (Pi) lactate. contrast, 5 mM glucose plus pyruvate substrates, glucose sole substrate, reperfusion phosphorylation potential function recovered near normal. critical ischemia-reperfusion transition 30 reperfusion cytosolic creatine kinase appeared displaced equilibrium, regardless substrate supply. conditions glucose pyruvate coinfused, glycolytic flux near maximum, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase reaction enhanced, accumulation Pi attenuated, ATP content slightly increased, adenosine release low. Thus, glucose prevented deterioration phosphorylation potential levels incompatible reperfusion recovery. Immediate energetic support due maximum glycolytic ATP production enhancement glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase reaction appeared act concert prevent detrimental collapse [ATP]/[( ADP][Pi]) creatine kinase dysfunction ischemia-reperfusion transition. Dichloroacetate (2 mM) plus glucose stimulated glycolysis failed fully reenergize reperfused heart; conversely, 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose plus pyruvate inhibited glycolysis produced virtually instantaneous de-energization reperfusion. following conclusions reached. (1) functional glycolysis required prevent energetic contractile collapse low-flow ischemic reperfused heart (2). Glucose stabilization energetics pyruvate-perfused hearts due part intensification glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase activity. (3) 2-Deoxyglucose depletes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate pool effects intracellular phosphate fixation form 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, cytosolic phosphorylation potential increased reperfusion failure occurs instantly. (4) Consistent correlations exist cytosolic ATP phosphorylation potential reperfusion contractile function. findings depict glycolysis highly adaptive emergency mechanism prevent deleterious myocyte deenergization forced ischemia-reperfusion transitions presence excess oxidative substrate.
