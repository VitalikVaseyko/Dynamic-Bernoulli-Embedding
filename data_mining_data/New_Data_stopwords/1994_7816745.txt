 characteristics energy metabolism evaluated gastrocnemius muscle 3- 24-month-old rats normoxia subjected either mild severe chronic (4 weeks) intermittent normobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, 4-week treatment saline TRH-analogue posatireline performed. muscular concentration following metabolites related energy metabolism evaluated: glycogen, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate; aspartate, glutamate, alanine; ammonia; ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine phosphate; energy charge potential. Furthermore maximum rate following muscular enzymes evaluated: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; total NADH cytochrome c reductase; cytochrome oxidase. age-related decrease muscular glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate alanine concentrations increase citrate concentration consistent age-related decreased hexokinase increased citrate synthase activities. Ageing characterized decrease muscular creatine phosphate concentration, energy mediators energy charge potential unchanged. chronic (4 weeks) intermittent normobaric mild severe hypoxia-induced alterations components anaerobic glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle energy storage, magnified skeletal muscle oldest animals. effect chronic treatment TRH-analogue posatireline suggests action central nervous system-acting drugs could also related direct influence muscular biochemical mechanisms related energy transduction.
