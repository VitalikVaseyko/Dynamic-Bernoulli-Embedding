 mechanism antihyperglycaemic action dexfenfluramine (DEXF) investigated isolated rat hepatocytes exposed glucagon. Preincubation hepatocytes DEXF caused dose-dependent inhibition cyclic AMP formation 100 nM glucagon (Ki = 0.29 mM) almost complete 1 mM DEXF. Surprisingly, glucagon-induced phosphorylase activation affected DEXF despite significant drop cyclic AMP levels. Glucose production stimulated glucagon inhibited 48% 1 mM DEXF, rate glucose production correlated positively steady-state concentration glucose 6-phosphate. DEXF also partially restored lactate + pyruvate production abolished optimal concentration glucagon. Although DEXF able prevent inactivation pyruvate kinase glucagon, lack accumulation phosphoenolpyruvate DEXF-treated cells supports conclusion flux pyruvate kinase stimulated, probably via increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, thereby increasing glycolysis. results thus indicate DEXF counteracts inhibition glycolysis glucagon property might contribute antihyperglycaemic effect drug. Furthermore, study shows that, presence drug, glucagon caused phosphorylase activation pyruvate kinase inactivation without significant increase cyclic AMP levels.
