 study aimed investigate function fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) regulating cell growth metabolism hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha)-dependent hypoxic response breast cancer cells. Two human breast carcinoma cell lines, including luminal-like cell line MCF-7 basal-like cell line MDA-MB-468, cultured hypoxia condition, expressions FBP1 HIF-1alpha detected western blotting. addition, up-regulated FPB1 MDA-MB-468 cells induced lentivirus. Next, cell growth, migration glucose metabolism evaluated MTT assay, Transwell commercial kits, well expressions HIF-1alpha target genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) detected RT-qPCR. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation used estimate whether hypoxia response elements (HREs) PDK1, LDHA, GLUT1 VEGF promoters incorporated FBP1. FBP1 downregulated MDA-MB-468 cells compared MCF-7 cells. Overexpression FBP1 MDA-MB-468 cells reduced cell growth (p < 0.05) migration (p < 0.05) well glycose consumption (p < 0.05) lactate production (p < 0.05). addition, overexpressed FBP1 inhibited HIF-1alpha protein expression mRNA levels PDK1, LDHA, GLUT1 VEGF (p < 0.05) hypoxia condition. Also, FBP1 revealed concrete connection PDK1. study reveal overexpressed FBP1 may repress tumor growth, migration glycolysis via targeting HIF-1alpha BLBC.
