 Autophagy highly regulated, energy dependent cellular process proteins, organelles cytoplasm sequestered autophagosomes digested sustain cellular homeostasis. hypothesized autophagy induced cancer cells i) starvation serum amino acid deprivation ii) treatment PI-103, class PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, glycolytic metabolism would affected, reducing flux lactate, effect may reversible. probed metabolism autophagy colorectal HT29 HCT116 Bax knock-out cells using hyperpolarized (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) steady-state (1)H-MRS. 24 hr PI103-treatment starvation caused significant reduction apparent forward rate constant (k(PL)) pyruvate lactate exchange compared controls HT29 (100 muM PI-103: 82%, p = 0.05) HCT116 Bax-ko cells (10 muM PI-103: 53%, p = 0.05; 20 muM PI-103: 42%, p<0.0001; starvation: 52%, p<0.001), associated reduced lactate excretion intracellular lactate cases, unchanged lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity increased NAD+/NADH ratio following PI103 treatment decreased LDH activity unchanged NAD+/NADH ratio following starvation. 48 hr recovery PI103 treatment, k(PL) remained control levels HT29 cells (74%, p = 0.02), increased treated values, remained 24 hr vehicle-treated control levels HCT116 Bax-ko cells (65%, p = 0.004) accompanied sustained reduction lactate excretion, recovery NAD+/NADH ratio intracellular lactate. Following recovery starvation, k(PL) significantly higher 24 hr vehicle-treated controls (140%, p = 0.05), associated increased LDH activity total cellular NAD(H). Changes k(PL) cellular excreted lactate provided measureable indicators major metabolic processes accompanying starvation- drug-induced autophagy. changes reversible, returning towards exceeding control values cellular recovery, potentially identifies resistance. k(PL) (hyperpolarized (13)C-MRS) lactate ((1)H-MRS) provide useful biomarkers autophagic process, enabling non-invasive monitoring Warburg effect.
