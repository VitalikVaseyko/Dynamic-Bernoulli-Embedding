 kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) molecular regulator protein kinase nuclear factor kappa B signalling. Recent evidence suggests AKIP1 increased response cardiac stress, modulates acute ischemic stress response, localized mitochondria cardiomyocytes. mitochondrial function AKIP1 is, however, still elusive. Here, investigated mitochondrial function AKIP1 neonatal cardiomyocyte model phenylephrine (PE)-induced hypertrophy. Using seahorse flux analyzer show PE stimulated mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) cardiomyocytes. partially dependent PE mediated AKIP1 induction, since silencing AKIP1 attenuated increase OCR. Interestingly, AKIP1 overexpression alone sufficient stimulate mitochondrial OCR particular ATP-linked OCR. also true pyruvate used substrate, indicating independent glycolytic flux. increase OCR independent mitochondrial biogenesis, changes ETC density altered mitochondrial membrane potential. fact, respiratory flux elevated per amount ETC, possibly enhanced ETC coupling. Furthermore, overexpression AKIP1 reduced silencing AKIP1 increased mitochondrial superoxide production, suggesting AKIP1 modulates efficiency electron flux ETC. Together, suggests AKIP1 overexpression improves mitochondrial function enhance respiration without excess superoxide generation, thereby implicating role AKIP1 mitochondrial stress adaptation. Upregulation AKIP1 different forms cardiac stress may therefore adaptive mechanism protect heart.
