 Metabolic adaptation emerged hallmark cancer promising therapeutic target, rapidly proliferating cancer cells adapt metabolism increasing nutrient uptake reorganizing metabolic fluxes support biosynthesis. transcription factor p73 belongs p53-family regulates tumorigenesis via two N-terminal isoforms, (TAp73) without (DeltaNp73) transactivation domain. TAp73 acts tumor suppressor, least partially induction cell cycle arrest apoptosis regulation genomic stability. Here, sought investigate whether TAp73 also affects metabolic profiling cancer cells. Using high throughput metabolomics, unveil thorough unexpected role TAp73 promoting Warburg effect cellular metabolism. TAp73-expressing cells show increased rate glycolysis, higher amino acid uptake increased levels biosynthesis acetyl-CoA. Moreover, report extensive TAp73-mediated upregulation several anabolic pathways including polyamine synthesis membrane phospholipids. TAp73 expression also increases cellular methyl-donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), possibly influencing methylation epigenetics, promotes arginine metabolism, suggestive role extracellular matrix (ECM) modeling. summary, data indicate TAp73 regulates multiple metabolic pathways impinge numerous cellular functions, that, overall, converge sustain cell growth proliferation.
