 Approximately 90% non-medullary thyroid malignancies originate follicular cell classified papillary follicular (well-differentiated) thyroid carcinomas, showing overall favourable prognosis. However, recurrence persistence disease occurs cases associated presence loco-regional distant metastatic lesions generally become resistant radioiodine therapy, glucose uptake metabolism increased. Recent advances field tumor progression shown CTC (circulating tumour cells) metabolic genetically heterogeneous. special interest unravelling mechanisms allow reminiscence dormant tumour lesions might related late disease progression increased risk recurrence. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) activated depletion cellular energy levels allows adaptive changes cell metabolism fundamental cell survival stressful environment; nevertheless, activation kinase also decreases cell proliferation rate induces tumour cell apoptosis. thyroid field, AMPK emerged novel important intracellular pathway, since regulates iodide glucose uptakes normal thyroid cells. Furthermore, recently demonstrated AMPK pathway highly activated papillary thyroid carcinomas, although clinical significance findings remains elusive. Herein review current knowledge role AMPK activation thyroid physiology pathophysiology, special focus thyroid cancer.
