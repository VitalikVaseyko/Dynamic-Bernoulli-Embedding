 Pyruvate kinase type M(2) Morris hepatoma 7777 tumour cell nuclei cytosol, contrast types L M(2) nuclei cytosol normal rat liver, shows histone H(1) kinase activity. Moreover, presence L-cysteine without ADP converts 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate presence L-arginine L-histidine not. L-Cysteine markedly stimulates activity histone H(1) kinase transferring phosphate group PEP to, results suggested, epsilon -amino group L-lysine histone H(1). This, L-cysteine known inhibit activity pyruvate kinase type M(2) neoplastic cells transfering phosphate PEP ADP, act control factor champing direction enzymatic reaction cancer cells.
