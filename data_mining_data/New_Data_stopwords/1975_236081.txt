 pyruvate kinases Escherichia coli activated ribose 5-phosphate (RP) partially purified. active form enzyme molecular weight 180 000 judged sucrose density gradient centrifugations Sephadex G-150 chromatography. dissociation absence sulfhydryl reagents dithiothreitol, enzyme inactivated molecular weight 110 000. Various substrates effectors enzyme, exception phosphate, influence association-dissociation equilibrium enzyme. enzyme, unlike pyruvate kinases many sources, activated potassium ions. Sulfate phosphate ions inhibitory enzyme. Phosphate seems allosteric inhibitor effect completely antagonized activators. enzyme activated allosteric manner two classes compounds, nucleoside monophosphates sugar phosphates hexose monophosphate pathway. Amongst nucleotides, guanosine 5'-phosphate adenosine 5'-phosphate effective activators. Amongst hexose monophosphate pathway intermediates, RP powerful activator, apparent activation constants low 1 Mu. Sugar phosphates esterified C-1 terminal positions entirely ineffective activation. effectors act changing Michaelis constant substrates. substrates enzyme, adenosine diphosphate phosphoenolpyruvate, yield cooperative-concentration plots presence unsaturating concentrations fixed changing substrate. initial velocity plots substrates become hyperbolic presence saturating concentrations RP.
