 Mammalian pyruvate kinase exists four isoforms characteristics tuned specific metabolic requirements different tissues. isoforms, except muscle isoform, exhibit typical allosteric behavior. case muscle isoform conundrum. inhibited allosteric inhibitor, Phe, yet traditionally considered allosteric enzyme. series study, energetic landscape rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (RMPK) established. phenomenon inhibition Phe shown physiological. Furthermore, thermodynamics temperature fluctuation concomitant pH change consequence muscle activity elucidated. shown (1) differential number protons released absorbed regard various linked reactions adds another level control shift binding constants equilibrium active <--> inactive state changes (the latter controls quantitatively activity RMPK); (2) ADP plays major role allosteric mechanism RMPK physiological temperatures (depending temperature, ADP assume dual opposite roles inhibitor binding preferentially inactive form substrate); (3) simulation RMPK behavior physiological conditions shows net results 21 thermodynamic parameters involved regulation well-tuned allow maximal response enzyme even minute changes temperature ligand concentration.
