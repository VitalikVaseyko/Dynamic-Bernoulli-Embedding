 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase A- (G6PD A-) deficiency common enzymopathy Africa sporadically leads manifest haemolytic anaemia. exactly known far haematological status individuals either homozygous heterozygous G6PD A- deficiency differs individuals normal G6PD activity. field study Nigeria, determined G6PD gene variants, corresponding G6PD pyruvate kinase (PK) activities, basic haematological parameters clinically healthy individuals, were, part, asymptomatically infected malaria parasites. Red blood cell counts haemoglobin levels lower G6PD A- deficient G6PD normal subjects. PK activities higher G6PD deficients, indicating younger red cell population individuals. findings suggest G6PD A- deficiency accompanied chronic subclinical haemolysis. consequence, reduced life span red cells leads impaired diagnosis G6PD heterozygosity applying routine biochemical methods.
