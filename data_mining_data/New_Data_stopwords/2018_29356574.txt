 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) wildly verified modulate glycolysis tumor cells. However, role PKM2 glycolysis osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes still unclear. present study, investigate function PKM2 OA chondrocyte glycolysis collagen matrix generation vitro. Results showed PKM2 upregulated OA chondrocytes compared healthy control chondrocytes. OA chondrocytes, ATP expression lower compared healthy control chondrocytes. Loss-of-function experiment showed PKM2 knockdown mediated lentivirus transfection could significantly suppress glucose consumption lactate secretion levels decrease glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha), indicating inhibition PKM2 knockdown glycolysis. Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed PKM2 knockdown inhibited OA chondrocyte proliferation promoted apoptosis. Western blot immunocytochemical staining showed PKM2 knockdown downregulated expression levels COL2A1 SOX-9. summary, results conclude PKM2 modulates glycolysis extracellular matrix generation, providing vital role PKM2 OA pathogenesis novel therapeutic target OA.
