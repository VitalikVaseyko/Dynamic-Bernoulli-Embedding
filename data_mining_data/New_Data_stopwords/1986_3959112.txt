 Male Wistar rats exposed 4 ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 10 d, intervals alveolar macrophages collected pulmonary lavage. metabolic enhancement alveolar macrophages observed 4 exposure. specific activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione peroxidase peroxidative metabolic pathway increased 1.29-fold (p less 0.001) 1.17-fold (p less 0.05) control values, respectively. specific activities succinate-cytochrome c reductase mitochondrial respiratory system pyruvate kinase glycolytic pathway also increased 1.17-fold (p less 0.01) 1.20-fold (p less 0.01) control values, respectively. addition, incorporation [3H]leucine [14C]thymidine alveolar macrophages elevated 1.77-fold (p less 0.001) 1.84-fold (p less 0.01) control values, respectively. activities enzymes tested decreased control levels 10. number alveolar macrophages collected exposed animals increased 1.24-fold (p less 0.01) control value 7 maintained significantly higher level 10. Alveolar macrophages heterogeneous size (7-21 micron diameter), distributed 11 17 micron diameter. Exposures 4 ppm NO2 increased significantly cells 9-13 micron diameter seventh day. results show exposures 4 ppm NO2 cause metabolic enhancement subsequent increase alveolar macrophages.
