 effects various metabolites pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase-catalyzed inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) studied extracts mitochondria purified green leaf tissue Pisum sativum L. Pyruvate uncompetitive inhibitor PDH kinase respect ATP whereas ADP competitive inhibitor. absence pyruvate fivefold excess ADP ATP required inhibit PDH kinase, however, presence pyruvate much lower ADP concentrations required. Inhibition PDH kinase pyruvate ADP synergistic addition ADP changed pyruvate uncompetitive inhibitor noncompetitive inhibitor. result indicates pyruvate acts "dead-end" inhibitor, binding PDH kinase-ADP reaction intermediate. Evidence also presented inhibition pyruvate presence thiamine pyrophosphate due formation hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate. results discussed terms regulation PDC activity pyruvate ADP periods increased demand carbon skeleton biosynthesis way tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle despite constraints imposed TCA cycle flux high ATP/ADP ratio.
