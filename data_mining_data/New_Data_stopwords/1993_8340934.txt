 effectiveness newly developed crystalloid cardioplegic solution containing 4 mM 1-hexanol 10 mM pyruvate compared St Thomas' Hospital solution. control perfusion Langendorff method, rabbit hearts (n = 7 group) arrested stored solutions (4 degrees C) 24 h subsequently reperfused 45 min. hexanol solution preserved left ventricular systolic diastolic function significantly better St Thomas' Hospital solution. Developed pressure significantly higher preservation hexanol solution St Thomas' Hospital solution left ventricular balloon volumes larger mid volume (P < 0.05). maximum developed pressure values storage hexanol St Thomas' Hospital solution 77% 42% maximum control values, respectively. Values end-diastolic pressure maximum ventricular volume 26.1 +/- 9.8 66.7 +/- 24.6 mmHg hexanol St Thomas' Hospital solution, respectively (P < 0.05). Creatine kinase release first 15 min reperfusion significantly lower hexanol solution compared St Thomas's Hospital solution (28.3 +/- 8.3 vs 92.9 +/- 52.6 IU/g wet weight, P < 0.05). conclusion, hexanol cardioplegic solution may suitable long-term cardiac preservation. evaluation effectiveness safety solution warranted.
