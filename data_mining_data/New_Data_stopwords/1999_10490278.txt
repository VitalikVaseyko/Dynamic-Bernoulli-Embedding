 mitochondrial electron transport system consumes 85% oxygen used cells, 5% oxygen consumed mitochondria converted superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species (ROS) normal physiologic conditions. Disruption mitochondrial ultrastructure one earliest pathologic events vitamin E depletion. present studies undertaken test whether direct link exists vitamin E production hydrogen peroxide mitochondria. first experiment, mice fed vitamin E-deficient or-sufficient diet 15 weeks, mitochondria liver skeletal muscle isolated determine rates hydrogen peroxide production. Deprivation vitamin E resulted approximately 5-fold increase mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production skeletal muscle 1-fold increase liver compared vitamin E-supplemented group. determine whether vitamin E dose-dependently influence production hydrogen peroxide, four groups male female rats fed diets containing 0, 20, 200, 2000 lU/kg vitamin E 90 d. Results showed dietary vitamin E dose-dependently attenuated hydrogen peroxide production mitochondria isolated liver skeletal muscle male female rats. Female rats, however, profoundly affected dietary vitamin E male rats suppression mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production organs studied. results showed vitamin E directly regulate hydrogen peroxide production mitochondria suggest overproduction mitochondrial ROS first event leading tissue damage observed vitamin E-deficiency syndromes. Data suggested regulating mitochondrial production ROS, vitamin E modulates expression activation signal transduction pathways redox-sensitive biologic modifiers, thereby delays prevents degenerative tissue changes.
