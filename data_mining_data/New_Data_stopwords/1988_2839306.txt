 Aspergillus nidulans pyruvate kinase gene isolated heterologous hybridization using corresponding yeast gene probe. 2.9 kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment, exclusively hybridized yeast gene, subcloned pBR322. clone used transform A. nidulans pkiA deletion mutant PKI+. analysis transformants respect kind integration revealed 80% homologous integration--55% double cross-over event (type III integration), 25% single cross-over event (type integration). Type II transformants (20%) arise non-homologous integration characterized respect sites integration. direct correlation number copies gene integrated genome measured pyruvate kinase activity found growth ona glycolytic carbon source. this, concluded 2.9 kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment contains complete pyruvate kinase structural gene, including promoter region. However, growth gluconeogenic carbon source, regulation gene expression found disturbed. acetate increase activity per gene copy (0.2 IU) found transformants, compared wild-type levels. suggested pyruvate kinase gene regulated negative control, sequences involved regulation missing cloned fragment.
