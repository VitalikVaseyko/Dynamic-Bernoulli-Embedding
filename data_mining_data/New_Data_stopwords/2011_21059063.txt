 REASONS PERFORMING STUDY: role molecular signalling pathways phenotypic adaptation skeletal muscle different exercise stimuli Thoroughbred horse reported previously. OBJECTIVE: examine CKM, COX4I1, COX4I2 PDK4 gene expression following high intensity sprint moderate intensity treadmill exercise stimuli skeletal muscle Thoroughbred horses. MATERIALS METHODS: Two groups trained 3-year-old Thoroughbred horses participated. Group (n = 6 females, n = 3 males) participated incremental step test (moderate intensity) fatigue HR(max) Sato high speed treadmill (distance = 5418.67 +/- 343.21). Group B (n = 8 females) participated routine 'work' (sprint) all-weather gallop (distance = 812.83 +/- 12.53). Biopsy samples obtained gluteus medius pre-exercise (T(0)), immediately post exercise (T(1)) 4 h post exercise (T(2)). physiological relevance venous blood samples collected measure plasma lactate creatine kinase concentrations. Changes mRNA expression determined quantitative real-time RT-PCR creatine kinase muscle (CKM), cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform 1 (COX4I1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV isoform 2 (COX4I2) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) genes. Statistical significance (alpha < 0.05) determined using Student's tests. RESULTS: COX4I2 mRNA expression decreased significantly Group remained unchanged Group B T(0) vs. T(2) (-1.7-fold, P = 0.017; -1.0-fold, P = 0.859). PDK4 mRNA expression increased significantly Group B Group T(0) vs. T(1) (3.8-fold, P = 0.039; 1.4-fold, P = 0.591). significant changes expression CKM COX4I1 mRNA abundance either group. CONCLUSIONS: Different exercise protocols elicit variable transcriptional responses key exercise relevant genes equine skeletal muscle due variation metabolic demand.
