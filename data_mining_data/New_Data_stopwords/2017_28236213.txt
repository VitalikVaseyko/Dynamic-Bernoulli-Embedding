 Early brain injury (EBI) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) main cause poor outcomes SAH patients, early inflammation plays important role acute pathophysiological events. demonstrated ethyl pyruvate (EP) anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effects various critical diseases, however, role EP EBI following SAH remains elucidated. study aimed evaluate effects EP EBI following SAH endovascular perforation rabbit model. rabbits randomly divided three groups: sham, SAH + Vehicle (equal volume) SAH + EP (30 mg/kg/day). MRI performed estimate reliability EBI 24 72 h SAH. Neurological scores recorded evaluate neurological deficit, ELISA kit used measure level tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), western blot used detect expression TNF-alpha, tJNK, pJNK, bax bcl-2 24 72 h SAH. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining used detect neuronal apoptosis neurodegeneration respectively, meanwhile hematoxylin eosin (H&E) staining used assess degree vasospasm. results demonstrated EP alleviated brain tissue injury (characterized diffusion weighted imaging T2 sequence MRI scan), significantly improved neurological scores 72 h SAH. EP decreased level TNF-alpha downregulated pJNK/tJNK bax/bcl-2 cerebral cortex hippocampus effectively 24 72 h SAH. Furthermore, EP reduced TUNEL FJB positive cells significantly. conclusion, present study supported EP afforded neuroprotective effects possibly via reducing TNF-alpha expression inhibition JNK signaling pathway. Therefore, EP may potent therapeutic agent attenuate EBI following SAH.
