 search viable strategies identify selective inhibitors protein kinases, designed binding assay probe interactions human phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) potential ligands. protocol based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) organic dyes. Specifically, expressed purified catalytic kinase domain PDK1 N-terminal histidine tag [His(6)-PDK1(DeltaPH)]. conjugated construct CdSe-ZnS core-shell QDs coated dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) tested response resulting assembly molecular dyad incorporating ATP ligand BODIPY chromophore. supramolecular association BODIPY-ATP dyad His(6)-PDK1(DeltaPH)-QD assembly encourages transfer energy QDs BODIPY dyes upon excitation. addition ATP results displacement BODIPY-ATP binding domain His(6)-PDK1(DeltaPH) conjugated nanoparticles. competitive binding, however, prevent energy transfer process. control experiment QDs, lacking His(6)-PDK1(DeltaPH), indicates BODIPY-ATP dyad adsorbs nonspecifically surface nanoparticles, promoting transfer energy CdSe core adsorbed BODIPY dyes. Thus, implementation FRET-based assays probe binding domain PDK1 luminescent QDs requires identification energy acceptors unable interact nonspecifically surface nanoparticles.
