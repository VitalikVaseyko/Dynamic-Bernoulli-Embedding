 Methods developed quantifying protein phosphatases-1, 2A, 2B 2C cell extracts, procedures exploited determine tissue subcellular distributions. addition, contribution enzyme total protein phosphatase activity skeletal muscle liver extracts towards nine proteins involved control glycogen metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis cholesterol synthesis assessed. protein phosphatase present significant concentrations skeletal muscle, heart muscle, liver, brain adipose tissue, although relative amounts differed considerably. skeletal muscle, protein phosphatase-1 major enzyme acting phosphorylase, glycogen synthase phosphorylase kinase (beta-subunit), thus major protein phosphatase responsible inactivation glycogenolysis stimulation glycogen synthesis. idea reinforced observation 50% protein phosphatase-1 activity associated protein-glycogen complex. liver, protein phosphatases-1, 2A 2C appear play role regulation glycogen metabolism. Protein phosphatase-1 accounted significant fraction total potential activity towards phosphorylase glycogen synthase, major phosphorylase kinase (beta-subunit) phosphatase tissue. addition, protein phosphatase present protein-glycogen complex. Protein phosphatase 2A also major phosphorylase phosphatase glycogen synthase phosphatase tissue. Protein phosphatase 2C significant glycogen synthase phosphatase liver, negligible activity toward phosphorylase phosphorylase kinase (beta-subunit). absence Ca2+, protein phosphatase 2A major phosphorylase kinase (alpha-subunit) phosphatase inhibitor-1 phosphatase, skeletal muscle liver. presence Ca2+, protein phosphatase 2B accounted activity towards substrates. Protein phosphatase 2A major enzyme acting L-pyruvate kinase, ATP-citrate lyase acetyl-CoA carboxylase rat liver, suggesting important role regulation glycolysis/gluconeogenesis fatty acid synthesis. Protein phosphatase 2C major enzyme acting hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase HMG-CoA reductase kinase, suggesting important role regulation cholesterol synthesis. However, observation 20% protein phosphatase-1 liver associated microsomal fraction suggests enzyme may also involved regulating HMG-CoA reductase, tightly associated microsomes. activity protein phosphatase-1 dilute skeletal muscle liver extracts sensitive inhibitor-1 inhibitor-2 purified enzyme. concentrated extracts, higher concentrations inhibitor proteins required inhibition time-dependent...
