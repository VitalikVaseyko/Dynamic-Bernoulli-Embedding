 present work, characterized proteomes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells normal pancreatic duct cells mass spectrometry using LTQ-Orbitrap, identified 1200 proteins sample. basis spectra count label-free quantification approach, identified large number differentially expressed metabolic enzymes proteins involved cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, transport, transcription, translation, cell proliferation well. data demonstrated metabolic pathways altered PDAC, consistent Warburg effect. analysis provides potentially comprehensive picture metabolism PDAC, may serve basis new diagnostic treatment PDAC.
