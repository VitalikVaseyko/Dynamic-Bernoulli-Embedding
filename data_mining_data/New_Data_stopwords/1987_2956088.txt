 Glycolytic metabolism assessed studying set key enzymes, anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus septum hippocampus, thyroidectomized rats. reversibility changes induced thyroidectomy assessed replacement therapy. thyroidectomized rats hexokinase activity significantly decreased anterior cortex hypothalamus. increase phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activity probably due increase cellular energy requirements. Hexokinase activity best restored treatment L-thyroxine (T4) T4+ propylthiouracil (PTU). low response pyruvate kinase activity treated animals could suggest metabolic step least reversible.
