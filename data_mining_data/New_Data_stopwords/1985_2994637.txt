 c.d. studies shown liver-pyruvate-kinase-related peptide substrates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase high tendency towards non-random structures non-aqueous media. phosphorylated, conformation tendencies decrease. structural change explained terms formation strong intrapeptide phosphate-guanidinium salt links. proposed similar events occur catalytic site protein kinase interaction could facilitate removal phosphorylated products.
