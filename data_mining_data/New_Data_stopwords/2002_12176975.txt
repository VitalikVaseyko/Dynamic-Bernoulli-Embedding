 hypoglycemia seen fasting PPARalpha null mouse thought due impaired liver fatty acid beta-oxidation. etiology hypoglycemia PPARalpha null mouse determined via stable isotope studies. Glucose, lactate, glycerol flux assessed fasted fed states 4-month-old PPARalpha null mice C57BL/6 WT maintained standard chow using new protocol flux assessment fasted fed states. Hepatic glucose production (HGP) glucose carbon recycling estimated using [U-(13)C(6)]glucose, HGP, lactate, glycerol turnover estimated utilizing either [U-(13)C(3)]lactate [2-(13)C]glycerol infused subcutaneously via Alza miniosmotic pumps. end 17-h fast, HGP higher PPARalpha null mice WT 37% (p < 0.01). However, recycling glucose carbon lactate back glucose lower PPARalpha null WT (39% versus 51%, p < 0.02). lack conversion lactate glucose confirmed using [U-(13)C(3)]lactate infusion. fasted state, HGP lactate lactate production decreased 65 55%, respectively (p < 0.05) PPARalpha null mice. contrast, [2-(13)C]glycerol infused, glycerol production HGP glycerol increased 80 250%, respectively (p < 0.01), fasted state PPARalpha null mice. increased HGP glycerol suppressed fed state. little change evident phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression, pyruvate kinase expression decreased 16-fold fasted PPARalpha null mice compared wild-type control. fasted fed insulin levels comparable, blood glucose levels lower PPARalpha null mice controls. conclusion, PPARalpha receptor function creates setpoint metabolic network regulates rate route HGP fasted fed states, part, controlling flux glycerol lactate triose-phosphate pyruvate/lactate pools.
