 Plasma glucose immunoreactive insulin (IRI) concentrations activities enzymes related glucose metabolism livers measured dogs cats. Nucleotide sequences conserved region glucokinase (GK) cDNA contained ATP- glucose-binding domains determined canine liver feline pancreas design species-specific oligonucleotide primers reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. significant differences plasma glucose IRI concentrations dogs cats. feline liver, although GK activities detected, activities hexokinase, fructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase significantly higher canine liver. partial sequences canine liver GK feline pancreas GK cDNA respectively 88% 89% identical rat liver GK cDNA. Expression GK gene observed canine liver pancreas feline pancreas RT-PCR using species specific primers based cDNA sequences.
