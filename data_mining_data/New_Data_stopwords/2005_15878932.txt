 tested hypothesis 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays important role regulating acute, exercise-induced activation metabolic genes skeletal muscle, dissected whole-body alpha2- alpha1-AMPK knockout (KO) wild-type (WT) mice rest, treadmill running (90 min), recovery. Running increased alpha1-AMPK kinase activity, phosphorylation (P) AMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)beta alpha2-WT alpha2-KO muscles increased alpha2-AMPK kinase activity alpha2-WT. alpha2-KO muscles, AMPK-P ACCbeta-P markedly lower compared alpha2-WT. However, alpha1-WT alpha1-KO muscles, AMPK-P ACCbeta-P levels identical rest increased similarly exercise two genotypes. alpha2-KO decreased peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha, uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), hexokinase II (HKII) transcription rest affect exercise-induced transcription. Exercise increased mRNA content PGC-1alpha, Forkhead box class (FOXO)1, HKII, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) similarly alpha2-WT alpha2-KO mice, whereas glucose transporter GLUT 4, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPTI), lipoprotein lipase, UCP3 mRNA unchanged exercise genotypes. CPTI mRNA lower alpha2-KO muscles alpha2-WT muscles time-points. alpha1-WT alpha1-KO muscles, running increased mRNA content PGC-1alpha FOXO1 similarly. alpha2-KO associated lower muscle adenosine 5'-triphosphate content, inosine monophosphate content increased substantially end exercise alpha2-KO muscles. addition, subcutaneous injection 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) increased mRNA content PGC-1alpha, HKII, FOXO1, PDK4, UCP3, alpha2-KO abolished AICAR-induced increases PGC-1alpha HKII mRNA. conclusion, KO alpha2- alpha1-AMPK isoform markedly diminished AMPK activation running. Nevertheless, exercise-induced activation investigated genes mouse skeletal muscle impaired alpha1- alpha2-AMPK KO muscles. Although cannot ruled activation remaining alpha-isoform sufficient increase gene activation exercise, present data support essential role AMPK regulating exercise-induced gene activation skeletal muscle.
