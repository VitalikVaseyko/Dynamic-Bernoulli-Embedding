 Cell-free extracts Rickettsia typhi tested activities enzymes tricarboxylic acid cycle, glutamate catabolism, glycolysis. organisms grown yolk sacs chicken embryos, harvested shortly time embryo death, purified Renografin density gradient centrifugation, ruptured French pressure cell. following enzymatic activities demonstrated: high levels malate dehydrogenase (MDH), moderate levels glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate, succinate, isocitrate dehydrogenases, citrate synthase, low levels glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. specific activities enzymes higher rickettsiae harvested time active proliferation, 3 4 days prior embryo death. Rickettsial MDH differentiated host MDH migration pattern polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. activities MDH two dehydrogenases, demonstrable cells disrupted, absent purified, intact rickettsial preparations. activity detected glucose-6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, lactate dehydrogenases, phosphoglucose isomerase, fructoaldolase, pyruvate kinase. results suggest extracts R. typhi contain demonstrable enzymes involved catabolism glutamate tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, unlike Coxiella burnetti, lack detectable glycolytic activity.
