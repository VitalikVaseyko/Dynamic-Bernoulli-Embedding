 Inorganic pyrophosphate function phosphate donor protein phosphorylation reactions yeast mitochondria. shown that, PPi substitutes ATP inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, maximal activity reached lag-period 30-60 minutes. 32P-labeling peptides shows [32P]PPi gives 25% labeling obtained [gamma-32P]ATP protein kinase reaction. PPi dependent phosphorylation increased several fold presence cold ATP.
