 study, six groups rats fed follows: Groups 1 2 fed formulated diets supplemented zinc without zinc respectively. Groups 3 4 fed formulated diets supplemented zinc plus phytic acid extracted sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) commercial phytic acid respectively. Groups 5 6 fed formulated diets supplemented phytic acid extract sweet potato commercial phytic acid respectively. animals fed three weeks sacrificed activities key enzymes carbohydrate lipid metabolism well transaminases liver determined. Blood glucose level also assessed. Phytic acid extract consumption sweet potato commercial phytic acid plus zinc supplement lowered blood glucose levels. significant change activity 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase among groups. Similarly, phytic acid supplementation showed significant decrease activity pyruvate kinase compared group fed formulated diets. significant increase activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase groups fed phytic extract sweet potato compared groups. activities malic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase study significantly altered among groups. lowering blood glucose levels desirable diabetics consume sweet potato diets. changes hepatic metabolic enzymes geared towards compensating decreased glycolytic responses.
