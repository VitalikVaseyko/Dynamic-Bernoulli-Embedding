 BACKGROUND: Expression dimeric M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, termed Tumor M2-PK, increased human cancers. study evaluates potential role pre-operative Tumor M2-PK marker prognosis patients pancreatic malignancy. METHODS: Seventy-three consecutive patients clinical diagnosis pancreatic peri-ampullary cancer enrolled. median (range) age 66 (23-83) years. Pre-operative samples venous blood taken analysis Tumor M2-PK. full study protocol approved North West Research Ethics Committee (protocol number 06/MRE08/69). RESULTS: mean (standard deviation) plasma Tumor M2-PK pancreatic/peri-ampullary malignancy 60.3 (106.5) U/ml 22 U/ml (SD: 12 U/ml) benign disease (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed Tumor M2-PK (> 27 U/mL), Ca19-9 (> 39 U/ml), resection status, disease stage associated poorer survival. Tumor M2-PK values greater 27 U/ml associated inferior survival compared lower values (hazard ratio 2.049, significantly increased risk death, p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: preliminary study shows elevated level Tumor M2-PK (with cutoff threshold 27 U/mL) measured pre-operatively associated poorer prognosis patients pancreatic peri-ampullary cancer.
