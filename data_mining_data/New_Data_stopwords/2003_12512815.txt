 found exposure B. alexandrina LC25 fungicide (Isoprothiolane), herbicide (Anilofos) plant extract (Euphorbia lactea) led highly significantly elevated number abnormal egg masses laid treated snails comparison control ones. LC25 caused reduction infection rate B. alexandrina. caused reduction number cercariae per snail patent period reduction period cercarial shedding. results obtained showed adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity tissue snails significantly increased response tested substances. activity level lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) significantly reduced response treatment. reduction reflect D. lactate pyruvate concentrations.
