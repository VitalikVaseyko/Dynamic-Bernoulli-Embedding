 rapid switch fermentative primarily oxidative type glucose utilization observed vitro differentiation Trypanosoma brucei STIB348 EATRO1244 bloodstream procyclic trypomastigotes. accordance previously published reports bloodstream populations produced pyruvate major end product glucose catabolism, together small amounts CO2, succinate glycerol. differentiation pyruvate excretion decreased within 48 h low levels produced 28-day procyclic stages. Concomitant decline pyruvate formation, acetate appeared new product rates respiratory CO2 increased considerably. amount carbon released compounds could account nearly glucose carbon consumed. Rates glucose utilization formation acetate CO2 cells differentiated 48 h essentially found 28-day procyclics. Succinate glycerol excretion remained low entire transformation process, significant difference pattern quantities end products found two trypanosome strains. trypanosome differentiation changes metabolism associated marked alterations enzyme activity levels. Activities tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+), succinate dehydrogenase fumarase detectable bloodstream trypomastigotes appeared upon differentiation 24 h. exception citrate synthase whose activity demonstrable 48 h postinoculation culture. 48 h majority TCA cycle enzyme activities continued increase steadily day 28. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased differentiating cells 48 h 25% level found bloodstream trypomastigotes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
