 aim research investigate effects endurance training reduction plasma glucose high intensity constant incremental speed tests Wistar rats. hypothesized plasma glucose might decreased exercised group heavy (more intense) exercise. Twenty-four 10-week-old male Wistar rats randomly assigned sedentary exercised groups. prescription endurance exercise training intensity determined 60% maximum intensity reached incremental speed test. animals trained running motorized treadmill, five days/week total period 67 weeks. Plasma glucose constant speed test exercised group 20 m/min reduced 14th, 21st 28th min compared sedentary group, well 25 m/min 21st 28th min. Plasma glucose incremental speed test decreased exercised group moment exhaustion (48th min) compared sedentary group (27th min). Endurance training positively modulates mitochondrial activity capacity substrate oxidation muscle liver. Thus, contrast studies high load exercise, effects endurance training decrease plasma glucose constant incremental speed tests significantly higher exercised sedentary rats associated improved muscle hepatic oxidative capacity, constituting important non-pharmacological intervention tool prevention insulin resistance, including type 2 diabetes mellitus.
