 Protein phosphatase-2B purified extracts rabbit skeletal muscle procedure involved fractionation ammonium sulphate, chromatography DEAE-Sepharose, fractionation poly(ethylene glycol), gel filtration Sephadex G-200 (Mr = 98000 +/- 4000), chromatography Affi-Gel Blue affinity chromatography calmodulin-Sepharose. enzyme purified 3500-fold seven days overall yield 0.5%. alpha-subunit phosphorylase kinase, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 myosin P-light chain rabbit skeletal muscle dephosphorylated protein phosphatase-2B similar kinetic constants. alpha-subunit phosphorylase kinase dephosphorylated least 100-fold rapidly beta-subunit, glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen synthase, histones H1 H2B, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, L-pyruvate kinase protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 dephosphorylated significant rates. Protein phosphatase-2B became activated 10-fold calmodulin (A0.5 = 6 nM) chromatography DEAE-Sepharose degree activation maintained throughout remainder purification. Calmodulin increased Vmax reaction without altering Km inhibitor-1. activity protein phosphatase-2B completely dependent Ca2+ presence absence calmodulin. Half-maximal activation observed 1.0 microM Ca2+ absence, 0.5 microM Ca2+ presence, 0.03 microM calmodulin. Protein phosphatase-2B inhibited completely trifluoperazine; half-maximal inhibition occurred 45 microM absence 35 microM presence 0.03 microM calmodulin. metabolic role protein phosphatase-2B vivo discussed light observation enzyme probably identical major calmodulin-binding protein neural tissue termed calcineurin CaM-BP80 [Stewart, A.
