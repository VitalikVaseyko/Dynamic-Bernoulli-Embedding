 Different approaches increasing carbon commitment aromatic amino acid biosynthesis compared isogenic strains Escherichia coli. strain wild-type PEP:glucose phosphotransferase (PTS) system, inactivation genes encoding pyruvate kinase (pykA pykF) resulted 3.4 fold increase carbon flow aromatic biosynthesis. strain already increased carbon flow aromatics virtue overexpression tktA gene (encoding transketolase), pykA and/or pykf mutations effect. PTS- glucose+ mutant showed 1.6-fold increase carbon flow aromatics compared PTS+ control strain. PTS- glucose+ host background, overexpression tktA caused 3.7-fold increase carbon flow, inactivation pykA pykF caused 5.8-fold increase. variables tested (PTS-glucose+, pykA, pykF, overexpressed tktA) combined single strain, 19.9-fold increase carbon commitment aromatic biosynthesis achieved.
