 Bloom syndrome (BS), autosomal recessive genetic disorder, instructive model explore variety questions "deregulation normal cell functioning". BS patients homozygous mutant BLM gene depict high sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) almost cells. However, possess cells dimorphic SCE phenotype. majority patients dimorphic SCE phenotype suggested compound heterozygotes, inheriting two different mutations BLM locus parent. intragenic somatic recombination event precursor stem cell patients envisaged give rise population cells functionally wild-type (BLM) gene normal SCE phenotype. Adopting unique dual approaches positional mapping "homozygosity descent" "somatic crossover point mapping", candidate BLM identified localized 250 Kb interval polymorphic loci, DI5S1108 D15127. sequence found encode 1417 amino acid peptide homology RecQ helicases, sub-family DExH box-containing DNA RNA helicases. presence chain terminating mutations 'candidate' gene BS patients suggested BLM gene. Apparantly proposed gene product seem provide answer variety clinical, biochemical experimental observations made BS BS cells till date. recent observation significant decrease activity pyruvate kinase three BS B-lymphoblastoid cell lines compared similar cell line established normal healthy subject presents another possible candidate elucidate defects BS. Experiments using okadaic acid, phosphatase-2a/1 inhibitor, depicted study many clinical features characteristic BS, easily explanable recently proposed BLM gene, explained deficiency PK alone and/or PP2a/PP1 activity.
