 activity multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes, isolated mitochondria beef kidney, beef heart, pork liver, regulated phosphorylation dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation concomitant inactivation three complexes catalyzed ATP-specific kinase, dephosphorylation concomitant reactivation catalyzed phosphatase. phosphatase separated component enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, three phosphatases functionally interchangeable. kinase isolated beef kidney complex, functional beef heart pork liver complexes. ADP competitive ATP, ADP effect pronounced kidney kinase liver heart kinases. Pyruvate protects strongly heart liver pruvate dehydrogenase complexes and, lesser extent, kidney complex inactivation ATP. Pyruvate apparently exerts effect pyruvate dehydrogenase component complex, rather kinase.
