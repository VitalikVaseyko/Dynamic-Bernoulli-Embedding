 Breast cancer common malignancy leading cause cancer-related mortality women worldwide. Taurine, abundant free amino acid, plays role several biological processes humans shown activity breast cancer tumors. investigate role mechanism taurine action breast cancer, used dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast carcinogenesis rats model breast cancer. administration taurine significantly reduced DMBA-induced breast cancer rate 80% 40% rats (p<0.05). Metabolomic studies using time-of-flight gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified 23 differential metabolites plasma taurine-administered rats. Bioinformatic analysis revealed metabolites involved multiple metabolic pathways, including energy, glucose, amino acid, nucleic acid metabolism, suggesting antitumor activity taurine rats mediated altered metabolism breast cancer cells. propose differential metabolites may potential biomarkers monitoring cancer therapy prognosis clinic. study provides scientific basis investigations antitumor mechanism taurine development novel therapeutic strategies treat breast cancer.
