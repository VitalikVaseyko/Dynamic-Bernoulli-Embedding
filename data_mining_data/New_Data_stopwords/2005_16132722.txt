 new Rattus norvegicus PanK gene isolated mRNA differential display high concentration glucose-stimulated rat, encodes human PanK4-like protein KOG2201 KOG4584 domain. Proteins interact rat PanK4 identified application yeast two-hybrid system. One components, Pkm2, found associated rat PanK4 two domains vitro vivo conditions. Immunofluorescence staining confocal scanning experiments showed PanK4 could transiently co-express Pkm2 cytoplasm HeLa cell HEK293T cell. findings suggest PanK4 interacts Pkm2 thereby may modulate glucose metabolism regulating activity Pkm2.
