 BACKGROUND: normoxic conditions, cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis opposed glucose oxidation energy production; altered metabolism correlates poor outcomes neuroblastoma. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) regulate aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2) promotes glucose oxidation. Here, sought determine whether gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) signaling regulates glucose metabolism. PROCEDURE: Neuroblastoma cell lines, BE(2)-C SK-N-AS, used. PCR microararay glucose metabolism performed GRP-R silenced cells. Target protein expression validated using Western blotting VEGF ELISA. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2 ) used induce chemical hypoxia. Efficacy targeting PDK regulation neuroblastoma assessed using dichloroacetate (DCA) conducting cell viability assays Western blotting apoptotic markers. RESULTS: Silencing GRP-R decreased HIF-1alpha expression blocked VEGF expression secretion normoxic CoCl2 induced hypoxia. PCR array analysis identified GRP-R silencing reduced PDK4 increased PDP2 mRNA expression. findings validated Western blotting. CoCl2 induced hypoxia increased VEGF secretion, HIF-1alpha, PDK4 expression. PDK4 silencing decreased HIF-1alpha expression VEGF expression secretion. DCA treatment decreased BE(2)-C SK-N-AS proliferation promoting cell death. GRP-R silencing DCA treatment synergistically halted BE(2)-C proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: report GRP-R regulates glucose metabolism neuroblastoma modulating HIF-1alpha, PDK4 PDP2. PDK4 regulates glucose metabolism, part, via regulation HIF-1alpha. Synergistic consequences GRP-R inhibition DCA treatment may suggest novel therapeutic strategy treatment aggressive neuroblastoma.
