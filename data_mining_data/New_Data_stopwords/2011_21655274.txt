 Repeated stressful events known associated onset depression. Further, stress activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system elevating plasma cortisol levels. However, little known related downstream molecular pathway. study, using repeated water-immersion restraint stress (WIRS) stressor mice, attempted elucidate molecular pathway induced elevated plasma corticosterone levels. observed following effects both, vivo vitro: (1) repeated exposure WIRS activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1)-serum glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK1)-N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)-adhesion molecule (i.e., N-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin) stabilization pathway via increase plasma corticosterone levels; (2) activation signaling pathway induces morphological changes oligodendrocytes; (3) recovery chronic stress, abnormal arborization oligodendrocytes depression-like symptoms return control levels. data strongly suggest abnornalities oligodendrocytes possibly related depression-like symptoms.
