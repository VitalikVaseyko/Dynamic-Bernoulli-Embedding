 Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) inherited disease caused defect gene encoding Low Density Lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R). ex vivo hepatic gene therapy restore expression normal protein hepatocytes correct disease. Improved transduction efficiency long lasting expression transduced gene remain main goals gene therapy research. developed efficient reliable method vivo transduction human, mouse primate primary hepatocytes. retroviral vector bearing LDL-R cDNA driven liver-type pyruvate kinase promoter allows high tissue specific expression gene primary hepatocytes. second vector housekeeping promoter corrects LDL-R deficiency fibroblasts FH patient. Ex vivo preclinical studies non-human primates provide new insight transduced cells biology reimplantation.
