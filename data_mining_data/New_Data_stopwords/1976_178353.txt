 chemical synthesis adenosine 5'-(O-1-thiotriphosphate) (ATPalphaS) adenosine 5'-(O-2-thiotriphosphate) (ATPbetaS) described. exist pair diastereomers, B. isomers ATPalphaS distinguished basis different reaction rates myokinase well nucleoside diphosphate kinase. enzymes, isomer reacts fast whereas isomer B reacts considerably slowly. Phosphorylation mixture isomers ADPalphaS pyruvate acetate kinase yields ATPalphaS, isomer A, whereas phosphoryl transfer creatine arginine kinase yields isomer B. isomers ATPbetaS differ reactivity myosin. Isomer readily hydrolyzed, whereas isomer B not. However, isomer B reacts faster nucleoside diphosphate kinase ADP isomer A. Phosphoryl transfer pyruvate kinase onto ADPbetaS yields ATPbetaS, isomer A, acetate kinase, isomer B.
