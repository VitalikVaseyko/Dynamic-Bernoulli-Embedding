 Normal cells aerobic organisms synthesize energy require form ATP via process oxidative phosphorylation. complex system resides mitochondria cells utilizes oxygen produce majority cellular ATP. However, tumors, especially elevated cholesterogenesis, increased reliance glycolysis energy, even conditions oxygen available. aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) far reaching ramifications tumor cells surround it. brief review, discuss abnormally high membrane cholesterol levels result subsequent deficiency oxidative energy production mitochondria cultured Morris hepatoma cells (MH-7777). identified voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) necessary component protein complex involved mitochondrial membrane cholesterol distribution transport. Work laboratory demonstrates ability VDAC influence mitochondrial membrane cholesterol distribution may implications mitochondrial characteristics oxidative phosphorylation induction apoptosis, well propensity cancer cells exhibit glycolytic phenotype.
