 Yeast pyruvate kinase irreversibly inactivated 1.1 mM 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine pH 8.6 initial rate constant 0.019 min-1. plot kinact versus 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine concentration yields hyperbolic curve indicative binding analog prior reaction. Marked protection afforded phosphoenolpyruvate + fructose 1,6-diphosphate + Mg2+ MgATP suggesting reaction occurs within active site. assayed less saturating phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations, inactivation caused reagent absence added ligands appears slower, reaction presence phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, Mg2+ produces activation enzyme, extent dependent assay concentration phosphoenolpyruvate. rate constant activation observed 0.113 min-1. activated enzyme exhibits lowered K0.5 Hill coefficient compared native pyruvate kinase. Subsequent addition 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine activated pyruvate kinase absence added ligands leads inactivation rate constant independent assay concentration phosphoenolpyruvate. Covalent reaction pyruvate kinase 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine thus occurs two distinct sites. presence phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, Mg2+, incorporation tritiated 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine linearly proportional extent activation enzyme, 4 mol reagent bound/mol tetrameric pyruvate kinase maximally activated enzyme. absence added ligands, approximately 4.5 mol reagent incorporated/mol enzyme 15 min reaction, 80% original activity remains. Subsequent incorporation proportional extent inactivation 8 mol bound 100% activaton. presence phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphospate, Mg2+, 3 tyrosines 1 lysine residue, absence ligands, 6 tyrosines 2 lysine residues modified, suggesting amino acids within two nucleotide sites.
