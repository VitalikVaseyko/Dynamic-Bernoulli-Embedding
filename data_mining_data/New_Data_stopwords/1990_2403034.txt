 hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex plays important role regulating branched-chain amino acid levels. compounds essential protein synthesis toxic present excess. dietary protein deficient, hepatic enzyme converted inactive, phosphorylated state conserve branched-chain amino acids protein synthesis. dietary protein excessive, enzyme active, dephosphorylated state commit excess branched-chain amino acids degradation. Inhibition protein synthesis cycloheximide, even animal starving dietary protein, results activation hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex prevent accumulation branched-chain amino acids. Likewise, increase branched-chain amino acids caused body wasting starvation uncontrolled diabetes blunted activation hepatic branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. activity state complex regulated short term concentration branched-chain alpha-ketoacids (inhibitors branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase) long term alteration total branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase activity. cDNAs cloned primary structure mature proteins deduced E1 alpha subunit human rat liver branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. cDNA protein sequences highly conserved two species. Considerable sequence similarity also apparent E1 alpha subunits human branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Maple syrup urine disease caused inherited deficiency branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. molecular basis one maple syrup urine disease family determined first time. patient found compound heterozygote, inheriting allele encoding abnormal E1 alpha father, allele expressed mother. known animal model disease (Polled Hereford cattle) also characterized. mutation animals introduces stop codon leader peptide E1 alpha subunit, resulting premature termination translation. Two thiamine responsive patients studied. deduced amino acid sequences mature E1 alpha subunit leader sequence normal, suggesting defect patients must exist subunit complex. 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, two enzymes valine catabolic pathway, purified liver tissue characterized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
