 phosphoprotein phosphatase purified rat liver cytosol. purification involved chromatography DEAE-cellulose. Sephacryl S-200, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) sucrose density gradient centrifugation. resulted almost homogeneous enzyme relative molecular mass, Mr, 90 000 gel filtration sucrose gradient centrifugation Mr = 44 500 sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Therefore seems dimeric enzyme. protein phosphatase (termed PFK-phosphatase) completely dependent Mg2+, replaced partly Mn2+. eluted DEAE-cellulose 120 mM NaCl, affected Ca2+, 100 microM trifluoperazine heat-stable inhibitor-2. Inhibition occurs phosphate, ammonium sulfate fluoride. PFK-phosphatase dephosphorylates preferentially alpha subunit phosphorylase kinase (alpha/beta dephosphorylation ratio 5-10). Phosphorylase a, mixed histone casein serve substrates. enzyme dephosphorylates effectively key enzymes glucose metabolism 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. Using protein phosphatase catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase, complete phosphorylation, dephosphorylation rephosphorylation cycle possible 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase substrate.
