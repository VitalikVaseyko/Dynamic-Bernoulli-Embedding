 1. effects 100 g/kg dietary substitution wheat bran body-weight gain, food consumption faecal dry weight mice given high-sucrose diet activities key enzymes carbohydrate lipid metabolism liver adipose tissue studied. 2. Wheat bran effect body-weight gain, food consumption faecal dry weight. 3. Wheat bran effect activities hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44), malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.40), ATP-citrate (pro-3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11). activity hepatic 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) increased expressed body-weight basis. 4. Wheat bran effect activities adipose tissue glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+), ATP-citrate (pro-3S)-lyase, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), 6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. 5. results suggest unlike guar gum bagasse, wheat bran change flux pathways lipogenesis liver adipose tissue mice given high-sucrose diets.
