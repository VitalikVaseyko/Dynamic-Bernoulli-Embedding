 report purification characterization protein membrane fraction Pseudomonas aeruginosa showing intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity. protein purified 48-kDa polypeptide capable binding hydrolyzing GTP. N-terminal sequence purified protein revealed similarity Escherichia coli Ras-like protein (Era), protein cross-reacted anti-Era antibodies. protein named Pseudomonas Ras-like protein (Pra). Anti-Pra antibodies also cross-reacted E. coli Era protein. Pra autophosphorylated vitro, phosphotransfer terminal phosphate [gamma-32P]GTP [gamma-32P]ATP. Pra capable complex formation truncated 12-kDa form nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) 16-kDa form. Purified Pra also shown physically interact pyruvate kinase (Pk); Pk Pra form complex, 12-kDa Ndk, Pk, Pra present, Pk higher affinity Pra forming complex 12-kDa Ndk. 12-kDa Ndk-Pra complex catalyzed increased synthesis GTP dGTP diminished synthesis CTP UTP dCTP dTTP relative synthesis uncomplexed Ndk. Moreover, complex Pra Pk resulted specific synthesis GTP well Pra present concentrations excess Pk. Membrane fractions cells harvested mid-log phase demonstrated little nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-synthesizing activity detectable Ndk. Membranes cells harvested late exponential phase showed NTP-synthesizing activity physical presence Ndk Pk Pra. contrast, membrane fractions cells harvested early late stationary phase showed predominant GTP synthesis presence increasing amounts Pk Pra. likely association Pra Ndk and/or Pk restricts intrinsic GTPase activity, may modulate stationary-phase gene expression survival P. aeruginosa modulating level GTP.
