 reversible interconversion two kinetically distinct forms hepatic pyruvate kinase regulated glucagon insulin demonstrated perfused rat liver. regulation involve total enzyme content liver, rather results modulation substrate dependence. forms pyruvate kinase liver homogenates distinguished measurements ratio enzyme activity subsaturating concentration P-enolpyruvate (1.3 mM) activity saturating concentration substrate (6.6 mM). low ratio form pyruvate kinase (ratio 0.1 0.2) obtained livers perfused 10(-7) glucagon 0.1 mM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). high ratio form enzyme obtained livers perfused hormone (ratio = 0.35 0.45). regulation pyruvate kinase glucagon cyclic AMP occurs within 2 min following hormone addition liver. Insulin (22 milliunits/ml) counteracts inhibition pyruvate kinase caused 5 X 10(-11) glucagon, slight influence enzyme properties absence hyperglycemic hormone. low ratio form pyruvate kinase obtained livers perfused glucagon cyclic AMP unstable liver extracts revert high ratio form within 10 min 37 degrees within hours 0 degrees. Pyruvate kinase quantitatively precipitated liver supernatants 2.5 ammonium sulfate. precipitation stabilizes enzyme preserves kinetically distinguishable forms. kinetic properties two forms rat hepatic pyruvate kinase examined using ammonium sulfate precipitates perfused rat liver. pH 7.5 high ratio form enzyme [S]0.5 = 1.6 +/- 0.2 mM P-enolpyruvate (n = 8). low ratio form enzyme livers perfused glucagon cyclic AMP [S]0.5 = 2.5 +/- 0.4 mM P-enolpyruvate (n = 8). modification pyruvate kinase induced glucagon alter dependence enzyme activity ADP (Km approximately 0.5 mM ADP forms enzyme). forms allosterically modulated fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, L-alanine, ATP. changes kinetic properties hepatic pyruvate kinase follow treating perfused rat liver glucagon cyclic AMP consistent changes observed enzyme properties upon phosphorylation vitro clyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase (Ljungstrom, O., Hjelmquist, G. Engstrom, L. (1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 358, 289--298). However, factors also influence enzyme activity similar manner remains demonstrated regulation hepatic pyruvate kinase glucagon cyclic AMP vivo involes phosphorylation.
