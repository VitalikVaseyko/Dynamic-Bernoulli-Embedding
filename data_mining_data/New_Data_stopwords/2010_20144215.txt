 BACKGROUND: Taxol one effective chemotherapeutic agents treatment patients breast cancer. Despite impressive clinical responses initially, majority patients eventually develop resistance Taxol. Lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) one predominant isoforms LDH expressed breast tissue, controls conversion pyruvate lactate plays important role glucose metabolism. study investigated role LDH-A mediating Taxol resistance human breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Taxol-resistant subclones, derived cancer cell line MDA-MB-435, sustained continuous growth high concentrations Taxol Taxol-sensitive cells could not. increased expression activity LDH-A detected Taxol-resistant cells compared parental cells. downregulation LDH-A siRNA significantly increased sensitivity Taxol-resistant cells Taxol. higher sensitivity specific LDH inhibitor, oxamate, found Taxol-resistant cells. Furthermore, treating cells combination Taxol oxamate showed synergistical inhibitory effect Taxol-resistant breast cancer cells promoting apoptosis cells. CONCLUSION: LDH-A plays important role Taxol resistance inhibition LDH-A re-sensitizes Taxol-resistant cells Taxol. supports Warburg effect property Taxol resistant cancer cells may play important role development Taxol resistance. knowledge, first report showing increased expression LDH-A plays important role Taxol resistance human breast cancer cells. study provides valuable information future development use targeted therapies, oxamate, treatment patients Taxol-resistant breast cancer.
