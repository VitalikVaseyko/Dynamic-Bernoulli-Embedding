 Drug development impeded need design drug target test detects binding drug candidate molecules target protein. Therefore, general method detect ligand binding highly desirable. Here, present observation toward developing method, based monitoring change water absorption infrared spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy high sensitivity water, changes hydrogen bond pattern observed. studied absorption changes water upon addition phosphenolpyruvate Mg(2+) pyruvate kinase. case, decrease absorption water 3000-3100 cm(-1) region low wavenumber side OH stretching vibration ligand binds protein. results suggest weaker water absorption due release protein-bound water bulk water ligand binding. observation high potential drug development well basic research lead general method detecting molecular association events (i) label-free, (ii) works binding partners aqueous solution, (iii) based universal process takes place binding events.
