 Metabolites measured freeze-clamped livers rats maintained 3 weeks stock diet supplemented 0.1% 5,5'-diphenylthiohydantoin (DPTH). Compared control animals, DPTH-treated animals lower levels phosphoenolypyruvate 3-phosphoglycerate elevated ratios [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] [NADP+]/[NADPH], suggesting mild hypothyroidism. Conversely, administration thyroxine (T4) 5 days animals fed control diet resulted elevated levels phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate, ketone bodies lowered ratios [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] [NADP+]/[NADPH], consistent known effects thyroid hormones liver tissues. animals simultaneously treated DPTH T4, effects thyroxine [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio levels phosphoenolypyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate ketone bodies reversed. However, calculated free cytoplasmic [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] ratio calculated cytochrome c3+/cytochrome c2+ ratio return control values. suggests actions thyroid hormone mediated potentiation adrenergic effects reversed DPTH. actions include decrease peripheral lipolysis, reduction free cytoplasmic [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio, apparent inhibition pyruvate kinase reaction, DPTH apparently reverse effects thyroid hormone mitochondrial O2 consumption ATP generation.
