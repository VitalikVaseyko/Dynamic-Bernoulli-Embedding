 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) neurodevelopmental disease characterized deficit social interactions communication repetitive restrictive behavior. altered cells, metabolic enzymes modified dysregulation canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway. ASD, canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway upregulated. focus review hypothesis Warburg effect stimulated overexpression canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway ASD. Upregulation WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces aerobic glycolysis, named Warburg effect, activation glucose transporter (Glut), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1(PDK1), monocarboxylate lactate transporter 1 (MCT-1), lactate dehydrogenase kinase-A (LDH-A) inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). aerobic glycolysis consists supply large part glucose lactate regardless oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis less efficient terms ATP production oxidative phosphorylation shunt TCA cycle. Dysregulation energetic metabolism might promote cell deregulation progression ASD. Warburg effect regulation could attractive target developing therapeutic interventions ASD.
