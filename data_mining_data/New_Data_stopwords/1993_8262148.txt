 described new well-differentiated mouse hepatocyte-like cell lines (mhAT) derived transgenic mice expressing simian virus 40 large antigen control antithrombin III gene promoter (Exp. Cell Res. (1992) 200, 175-185). attempt understand phenotypic variations different cell lines, analyzed content liver-specific transcription factors level proteins, gel shift analysis, mRNA, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Moreover, transactivating ability endogenous HNF1 alpha C/EBP alpha also evaluated measuring activity transfected synthetic promoters consisting DNA element homopolymers upstream TATA box. High levels HNF1, HNF3, HNF4 transcription factors maintained mhAT cells. contrast, C/EBP alpha much variable different cell lines less abundant vivo, liver. investigated influence HNF1 alpha C/EBP alpha activity transfected liver-specific promoters. HNF1 alpha limiting activity transfected liver-type pyruvate kinase albumin promoters. contrast, activity albumin promoter different lines clearly dependent C/EBP alpha content, seems, therefore, essential factor modulating expression gene HNF1 alpha-containing cells. work shows correlations promoter activities transacting factor contents panel well-differentiated cultured cells used determine respective role transcription factors strength promoters.
