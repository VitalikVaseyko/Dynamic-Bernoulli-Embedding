 human KB LoVo cell lines, high affinity taurine uptake strongly reduced time dose-dependent manner cumene hydroperoxide (CH) lesser extent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Uptake-inhibition greater multidrug resistant (MDR) cells non-MDR counterparts. Basal taurine efflux unaffected oxidants. Lipid peroxidation levels closely correlated uptake inhibition levels, greater MDR cells non-MDR counterparts. two oxidants reduced Vmax and, lesser extent, affinity transporter taurine. also reduced low affinity taurine uptake and, lesser extent, taurine diffusion. composition medium used cell treatment, especially pyruvate content, greatly affected H2O2 effect. H2O2- CH-induced reduction high affinity taurine uptake unaffected protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors calmodulin antagonist W-13, ruling involvement PKC perhaps calmodulin kinases effect.
