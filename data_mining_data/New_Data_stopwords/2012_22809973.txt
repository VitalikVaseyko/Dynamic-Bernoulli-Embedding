 Glucose-induced insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells depends mitochondrial activation. organelle, glucose-derived pyruvate metabolised along oxidative anaplerotic pathway generate downstream signals leading insulin granule exocytosis. Entry oxidative pathway catalysed pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) controlled part phosphorylation PDH E1alpha subunit blocking enzyme activity. find glucose nutrient secretagogues induce PDH E1alpha phosphorylation INS-1E cells rat islets. INS-1E cells primary beta-cells express pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, 2 3, mediate observed phosphorylation. INS-1E cells, suppression two main isoforms, PDK1 PDK3, almost completely prevented PDH E1alpha phosphorylation. basal glucose conditions, phosphorylation barely detectable therefore enzyme almost fully active (90% maximal). glucose stimulation, PDH partially inhibited (to 78% maximal). Preventing PDH phosphorylation situ suppression PDK1, 2 3 neither enhanced pyruvate oxidation insulin secretion. conclusion, although glucose stimulates E1alpha phosphorylation therefore inhibits PDH activity, control mechanism alter metabolism-secretion coupling INS-1E clonal beta-cells.
