 Pyruvate kinase enzyme catalyzes conversion phosphoenolpyruvate ADP pyruvate ATP glycolysis plays role regulating cell metabolism. four mammalian pyruvate kinase isoforms unique tissue expression patterns regulatory properties. M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) supports anabolic metabolism expressed cancer normal tissue. enzymatic activity PKM2 allosterically regulated intracellular signaling pathways metabolites; PKM2 thus integrates signaling metabolic inputs modulate glucose metabolism according needs cell. Recent advances increased understanding metabolic regulation pyruvate kinase, raised new questions, suggested possibility non-canonical PKM2 functions regulate gene expression cell cycle progression via protein-protein interactions protein kinase activity. review structure, function, regulation pyruvate kinase discuss properties enable regulation PKM2 cell proliferation tumor growth.
