 Rats received choline-deficient diet containing 0.1% (w/w) DL-ethionine (CDE) 4, 10, 14 22 weeks. separate group treated 4 weeks CDE received normal diet 4 weeks. L M2 isoenzymes pyruvate kinase immunocytochemically demonstrated liver sections. L-PK expression strongly reduced hepatocytes 4 weeks treatment remained low end study. Withdrawal CDE 4 weeks followed 4 weeks normal diet resulted nearly full recovery L-PK expression compared untreated controls. later stages (10-22 weeks CDE- treatment) many pseudolobules, preneoplastic foci altered hepatocytes (FAH) combined clear/acidophilic cell foci (CCF/ACF) mixed/basophilic cell foci (MCF/BCF), hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) observed. Pseudolobules showed slight reduction L-PK-expression, negative M2-PK. clear cell components CCF/ACF excessively storing glycogen, L-PK-expression increased compared surrounding parenchyma hepatocytes controls. acidophilic cell components less pronounced glycogen storage L-PK expression similar pseudolobules showing slightly reduced content enzyme protein. M2-PK invariably negative CCF/ACF. MCF glycogen-storing subpopulations expressed L-PK, whereas glycogen-poor basophilic populations L-PK protein strongly reduced. M2-PK expressed MCF. However, rare MCF reduction L-PK expression combined significant expression M2-PK. HCA M2-PK underwent increase, although variable degree, L-PK remained strongly reduced. results show isoenzyme shift L-PK M2-PK takes place late stage hepatocarcinogenic process, MCF low L-PK expression reexpression M2-PK probably represent direct precursor lesions hepatocellular neoplasms.
