 mutant Methanosarcina barkeri (Fusaro) able grow pyruvate sole carbon energy source. growth, pyruvate converted CH4 CO2, 1.5 mol ATP per mol CH4 formed (A.-K. Bock, A. Prieger-Kraft, P. Schonheit, Arch. Microbiol. 161:33-46, 1994). pyruvate-utilizing mutant M. barkeri could also grow pyruvate methanogenesis completely inhibited bromoethanesulfonate (BES). mutant grew pyruvate (80 mM) presence 2 mM BES doubling time 30 h cell densities 400 mg (dry weight) cells per liter. growth pyruvate, major fermentation products acetate CO2 (about 0.9 mol per mol pyruvate). Small amounts acetoin, acetolactate, alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine also detected. CH4 formed. molar growth yield (Yacetate) 9 g cells (dry weight) per mol acetate, indicating ATP yield 1 mol/mol acetate formed. Growth pyruvate presence BES limited; six eight generations, doubling times increased final cell densities decreased. 9 11 generations, growth stopped completely. presence BES, suspensions pyruvate-grown cells fermented pyruvate acetate, CO2, H2. CH4 formed. Conversion pyruvate acetate, complete absence methanogenesis, coupled ATP synthesis. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, inhibitor H(+)-translocating ATP synthase, inhibit ATP formation. presence dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, stoichiometries 0.9 mol ATP per mol acetate observed. uncoupler arsenate completely inhibited ATP synthesis, rates acetate, CO2, H2 formation stimulated fourfold. Cell extracts M. barkeri grown pyruvate nonmethenogenic conditions contained pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (0.5 U/mg), phosphate acetyltransferase (12 U/mg), acetate kinase (12 U/mg). data concluded ATP synthesized substrate level phosphorylation growth M. barkeri mutant pyruvate absence methanogenesis. first report growth methanogen nonmethanogenic conditions expense fermentative energy metabolism.
