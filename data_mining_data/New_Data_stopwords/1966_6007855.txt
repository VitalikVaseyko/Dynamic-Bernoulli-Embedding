 1. Added Ca(2+) inhibited lactate formation sugar phosphates intact Ehrlich ascites-tumour cells. Lactate formation glucose cells unaffected added Ca(2+). 2. Ca(2+) inhibition lactate formation intact cells occurred extracellular medium. 3. Intact ascites-tumour cells take Ca(2+)in vitro. 4. Glycolysis sugar phosphates cell extracts well pyruvate formation 3-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate inhibited Ca(2+). 5. concluded Ca(2+) inhibited pyruvate-kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) reaction. Further, Ca(2+) inhibition pyruvate kinase could correlated overall inhibition glycolysis. 6. Concentrations Ca(2+) usually present Krebs-Ringer buffers, inhibited glycolysis pyruvate-kinase activity approx. 50%. 7. inhibition glycolysis added Ca(2+) could partially reversed K(+) completely reversed Mg(2+) stoicheiometric amounts EDTA. 8. hypothesis advanced inability tumour cells take Ca(2+) factor contributing towards high rate glycolysis.
