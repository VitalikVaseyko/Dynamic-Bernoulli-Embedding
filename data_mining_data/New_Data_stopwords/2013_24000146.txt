 Metabolic reprogramming alters utilization glucose including "Warburg effect" critical development tumorigenic phenotype. However, effects Harvey-ras (H-ras) oncogene cellular energy metabolism mammary carcinogenesis known. purpose study determine effect H-ras transformation glucose metabolism using untransformed MCF10A H-ras oncogene transfected (MCF10A-ras) human breast epithelial cells, model early breast cancer progression. measured metabolite fluxes cell membrane selective micro-biosensor, [(13)C6 ]glucose flux (13)C-mass isotopomer distribution analysis media metabolites, intracellular metabolite levels NMR, gene expression glucose metabolism enzymes quantitative PCR. Results studies indicated MCF10A-ras cells exhibited enhanced glycolytic activity lactate production, decreased glucose flux tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, well increase utilization glucose pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). results provide evidence role H-ras oncogene metabolic reprogramming MCF10A cells early mammary carcinogenesis.
