 OBJECTIVE: Primary fibromyalgia (FM) painful condition, generally treated analgesic drugs antidepressants, associated hyperpyruvicemia reduced high energy phosphate muscle. Biological investigations performed patients FM determine whether syndrome related carbohydrate metabolism impairment. METHOD: Glycolysis studied 25 patients FM, 10 patients hypothyroidism (HO), 15 patients osteoarticular chronic pain (OACP), 36 healthy controls. Laboratory studies performed whole blood (pyruvate), erythrocytes (pyruvate kinase, 2-3 diphosphoglycerate, glyceraldehyde phosphodeshydrogenase, adenosine triphosphate), plasma serum (lactate rest forearm ischemic exercise, lactico deshydrogenase iso-enzymes). RESULTS: Comparisons study groups controls demonstrated increased pyruvate decreased lactate production FM HO; adenosine triphosphate muscular isoenzymes lacticodeshydrogenase decreased FM only; glycolysis significantly impaired OACP. CONCLUSIONS: findings provide support FM associated biochemical abnormalities require appropriate metabolic therapy.
