 signaling mechanism induced cadmium (Cd) zinc (Zn) gill cells Mytilus galloprovincialis investigated. metals cause increase *O2- production, Cd potent (216 +/- 15%) Zn (150 +/- 9.5%), relation control value (100%). metals effect reversed incubation amiloride analogue, EIPA, selective Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) inhibitor well presence calphostin C, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. heavy metals effect *O2- production mediated via interaction metal ions alpha1- beta-adrenergic receptors, shown incubation respective agonists antagonists. addition, metals caused increase intracellular pH (pHi) gill cells. EIPA together either metal significantly reduced effect metal treatment pHi. Incubation gill cells oxidants rotenone, antimycin pyruvate caused significant increase pHi (delta pHi 0.830, 0.272 0.610, respectively), presence anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decrease pHi (delta pHi -0.090) measured, indicating change reactive oxygen species (ROS) production heavy metals affects NHE activity. rosiglitazone incubated together either heavy metal decrease O2- production observed. results show key role NHE signal transduction pathway induced Zn Cd gill cells, involvement ROS, PKC, adrenergic PPAR-gamma receptors. addition, differences two metals concerning NHE activation, O2- production interaction adrenergic receptors observed.
