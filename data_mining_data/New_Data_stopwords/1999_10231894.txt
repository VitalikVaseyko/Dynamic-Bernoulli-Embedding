 method based pseudoaffinity chromatography developed separation lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) aldolase rabbit muscle extract using cross-linked guar (CLG) cross-linked pectin (CLP) matrices, dyes ligands. Screening several dyes revealed dyes No. 1014 No. 1015, immobilized CLG CLP displayed higher affinity LDH PK. Aldolase retained dye columns. observed 1014-CLP 1014-CLG columns retained 90% 55% LDH activities, respectively, whereas 1015-CLP 1015-CLG retained 83% LDH 72% PK. coupled-column system comprising 1014-CLP 1015-CLP 1014-CLG 1015-CLG could separate LDH, PK, aldolase mixture enzymes, well rabbit muscle extract. Enzymes found homogeneous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. method found simple economical.
