 Physiological hyperglycaemia hyperinsulinaemia strong modulators gene expression, underpins well-known effects insulin action energy metabolism. aim present study examine whether acute vivo exposure healthy humans hyperinsulinaemia hyperglycaemia independent additive effects expression key metabolic genes skeletal muscle. three randomized occasions, seven young subjects underwent 4 h (i) hyperinsulinaemic (50 m-units.m(-)(2).min(-)(1)) hyperglycaemic (10 mmol/l) clamp (HIHG), (ii) hyperglycaemic (10 mmol/l) euinsulinaemic (5 m-units.m(-)(2).min(-)(1)) clamp (LIHG) (iii) hyperinsulinaemic (50 m-units.m(-)(2).min(-)(1)) euglycaemic (4.5 mmol/l) clamp (HING). Muscle biopsies obtained clamp determination expression genes involved energy metabolism, phosphorylation key insulin signalling proteins. Hyperinsulinaemia hyperglycaemia exerted independent effects similar direction modulation PI3KR1 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, regulatory 1), LXRalpha (liver X receptor alpha), PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) FOXO1 (forkhead box O1A) produced additive effect PI3KR1, gene encodes p85alpha subunit PI3K human skeletal muscle. Acute hyperglycaemia altered expression genes involved fatty acid transport oxidation [fatty acid transporter (CD36), LCAD (long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) FOXO1], lipogenesis [LXRalpha, ChREBP (carbohydrate-responseelement-binding protein), ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). Surperimposing hyperinsulinaemia hyperglycaemia modulated number genes involved insulin signalling, glucose metabolism intracellular lipid accumulation exerted additive effect PI3KR1. may early molecular events precede development glucolipotoxicity insulin resistance normally associated prolonged periods hyperglycaemia hyperinsulinaemia.
