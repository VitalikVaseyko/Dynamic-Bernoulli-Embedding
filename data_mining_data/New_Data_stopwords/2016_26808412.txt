 Treatment planning, outcome prognosis strongly related adequate tumor staging bladder cancer (BC). Unfortunately, large discrepancy exists preoperative clinical final pathologic staging. Therefore, advanced imaging-based technique crucial adequate staging. Although Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) currently best vivo imaging technique BC staging excellent soft-tissue contrast absence ionizing radiation lacks cancer-specificity. Tumor-specific positron emission tomography (PET), based Warburg effect (preferential uptake glucose cancer cells), exploits radioactively-labeled glucose analogs, i.e., FDG. Although FDG-PET highly cancer specific, lacks resolution contrast quality comparable MRI. Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables detection low concentrations metabolites containing protons. BC attractive target glucose CEST MRI because, addition typical systemic administration, glucose might also directly applied bladder reduce toxicity-related complications. first stage development contrast-specific BC imaging technique studied glucose uptake bladder epithelial cells observed glucose is, indeed, consumed BC cells higher intensity non-transformed urothelial cells. effect might partly explained increased expression glucose transporters GLUT1 GLUT3 transformed cells compared normal urothelium. also detected higher lactate production BC cells another cancer-specific manifestation Warburg effect. addition, observed metabolic alterations BC cells compared non-transformed cells: particular, increased pyruvate synthesis. glucose substituted glutamine culture media, preferential uptake glutamine BC cells observed. preferential uptake glucose BC cells gives opportunity develop NMR based imaging procedures glucose derivatives serve contrasting agent. addition, metabolic alterations observed BC cells could provide basis development new anti-cancer therapeutics.
