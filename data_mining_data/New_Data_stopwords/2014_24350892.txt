 significance metabolic networks guiding fate stem cell differentiation beginning emerge. Oxidative metabolism suggested play major role process. Therefore, critical understand underlying mechanisms metabolic alterations occurring stem cells manipulate ultimate outcome pluripotent cells. Here, using P19 murine embryonal carcinoma cells model system, role mitochondrial biogenesis modulation metabolic networks dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation revealed. Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) technology aided profiling key enzymes, hexokinase (HK) [EC 2.7.1.1], glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) [EC 5.3.1.9], pyruvate kinase (PK) [EC 2.7.1.40], Complex [EC 1.6.5.3], Complex IV [EC 1.9.3.1], involved energy budget differentiated cells. Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production shown increased DMSO-treated cells upon exposure tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle substrates, succinate malate. increased mitochondrial activity biogenesis confirmed immunofluorescence microscopy. Collectively, results indicate oxidative energy metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis sharply upregulated DMSO-differentiated P19 cells. functional metabolic proteomic study provides evidence modulation mitochondrial energy metabolism pivotal component cellular differentiation process may dictate final destiny stem cells.
