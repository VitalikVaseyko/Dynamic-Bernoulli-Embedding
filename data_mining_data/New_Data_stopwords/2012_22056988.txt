 embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform highly expressed human cancer. contrast established role PKM2 aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, non-metabolic functions remain elusive. demonstrate, human cancer cells, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces translocation PKM2, PKM1, nucleus, K433 PKM2 binds c-Src-phosphorylated Y333 beta-catenin. interaction required proteins recruited CCND1 promoter, leading HDAC3 removal promoter, histone H3 acetylation cyclin D1 expression. PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation instrumental EGFR-promoted tumour cell proliferation brain tumour development. addition, positive correlations identified c-Src activity, beta-catenin Y333 phosphorylation PKM2 nuclear accumulation human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels beta-catenin phosphorylation nuclear PKM2 correlated grades glioma malignancy prognosis. findings reveal EGF induces beta-catenin transactivation via mechanism distinct induced Wnt/Wingless highlight essential non-metabolic functions PKM2 EGFR-promoted beta-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation tumorigenesis.
