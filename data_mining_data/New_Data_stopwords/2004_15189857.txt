 mathematical description made enzyme amplification mechanism involving coupling two substrate cycles. amplification system one noncycling products first substrate cycle acts trigger molecule continuously feeds second substrate cycle. Time-concentration equations describing evolution species involved system obtained. model illustrated quantification nanomolar levels ADP (and/or ATP) continuous assay involving enzymes L-lactate dehydrogenase L-lactate oxidase cycle pyruvate accumulated first enzymatic cycle constituted enzymes pyruvate kinase hexokinase. Progress curves seen parabolic, and, according kinetic equations obtained, followed second-order polynomials reaction time. Mathematical equations minimizing cost assays also given. model applicable amplified analytical determination low levels metabolite enzyme activity, amplification capacity, together simplicity determining kinetic parameters, enable employed enzyme immunoassays increase magnitude measured response.
