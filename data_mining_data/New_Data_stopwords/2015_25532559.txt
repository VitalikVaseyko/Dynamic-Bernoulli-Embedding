 BACKGROUND: Supplementation broiler chicken diets probiotics may improve carcass characteristics meat quality. However, underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. present study, 2D-DIGE-based proteomics employed investigate proteome changes associated improved carcass traits meat quality Arbor Acres broilers (Gallus gallus) fed probiotic Enterococcus faecium. RESULTS: probiotic significantly increased meat colour, water holding capacity pH pectoral muscle decreased abdominal fat content. meat quality changes related altered abundance 22 proteins pectoral muscle following E. faecium feeding. these, 17 proteins central roles regulating meat quality due biological interaction network. Altered cytoskeletal chaperon protein expression also contribute improved water holding capacity colour meat, suggests upregulation chaperon proteins maintains cell integrity prevents moisture loss enhancing folding recovery membrane cytoskeletal proteins. down-regulation beta-enolase pyruvate kinase muscle isozymes suggests roles increasing pH meat decreasing production lactic acid. validity proteomics results confirmed qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: study reveals improved meat quality broilers fed probiotics triggered proteome alterations (especially glycolytic proteins), provides new insight mechanism probiotics improve poultry production.
