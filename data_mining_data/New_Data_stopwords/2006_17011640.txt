 Immune responses beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections hypothesized trigger tic disorders early-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) pediatric populations. identify M1 isoform glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PK) autoimmune target Tourette syndrome associated disorders. Antibodies PK reacted strongly surface antigens infectious strains streptococcus, antibodies streptococcal proteins reacted PK. Moreover, immunoreactivity PK patients exacerbated symptoms recently acquired streptococcal infection 7-fold higher compared patients exacerbated symptoms evidence streptococcal infection. data suggest PK function autoimmune target immunoreactivity may associated Tourette syndrome, OCD, associated disorders.
