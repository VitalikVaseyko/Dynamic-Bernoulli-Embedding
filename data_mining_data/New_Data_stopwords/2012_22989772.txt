 One paradigms cancer pathogenesis requirement cell undergo transformation respiration aerobic glycolysis - Warburg effect - become malignant. demands rapidly proliferating cell carbon metabolites synthesis biomass, energy redox equivalents, fundamentally different requirements differentiated, quiescent cell, remains open whether metabolic switch cause consequence malignant transformation. One major requirements synthesis lipids membrane formation allow cell proliferation, cell cycle progression cytokinesis. Enzymes involved lipid metabolism indeed found play major role cancer cell proliferation, enzymes conserved yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. notably, cancer cell physiology metabolic fluxes similar fermenting rapidly proliferating yeast. types cells display highly active pathways synthesis fatty acids incorporation complex lipids, imbalances synthesis turnover lipids affect growth viability yeast cancer cells. Thus, understanding lipid metabolism S. cerevisiae cell cycle progression cell proliferation may complement recent efforts understand importance fundamental regulatory mechanisms pathways cancer.
