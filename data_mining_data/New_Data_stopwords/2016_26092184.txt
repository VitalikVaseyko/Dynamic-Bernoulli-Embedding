 Gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) Madagascar present excellent model studies torpor regulation primate species. present study, analyzed response insulin signaling pathway well controls carbohydrate sparing six different tissues torpid versus aroused gray mouse lemurs. found relative level phospho-insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) significantly increased muscle, whereas level phospho-insulin receptor (IR) decreased white adipose tissue (WAT) torpid animals, suggesting inhibition insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling torpor tissues. contrast, level phospho-IR increased liver. Interestingly, muscle, WAT, liver occupy central roles whole body homeostasis displays regulatory controls operating plasma membrane. Changes tissues included increase phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK3alpha) decrease phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) heart, decrease phospho-mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) kidney. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) gates carbohydrate entry mitochondria inhibited via phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (e.g., PDK4). skeletal muscle, protein expression PDK4 phosphorylated PDH Ser 300 increased, suggesting inhibition torpor. contrast, changes levels PDH expression phosphorylation tissues comparing torpid aroused animals. Information gained studies highlight molecular controls help regulate metabolic rate depression balance energetics primate torpor.
