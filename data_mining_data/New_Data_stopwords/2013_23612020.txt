 Metabolic alteration cancer cells one conspicuous characteristics distinguish cancer cells normal cells. Many studies suggest several underlying mechanisms lead Warburg effect (increased aerobic glycolysis) cancer development. Here, explored oroxylin affected glycolytic metabolism cancer cells underlying mechanism involved process. data revealed oroxylin adriamycin could inhibit lactate generation glucose uptake HepG2 cells mild concentrations, without causing robust cell apoptosis. Oroxylin exerted little influence oxygen consumption, whereas adriamycin decreased oxygen consumption concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, oroxylin could increase protein mRNA expression TP53-induced glycolysis apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) synthesis cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), key metabolic modulators regulated p53. Meanwhile adriamycin could increase protein mRNA expression TIGAR SCO2, decrease phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). Oroxylin adriamycin also modulated stability activity p53 inducing phosphorylation p53 Ser15 suppressing expression MDM2. Furthermore, p53 siRNA p53 inhibitor assay wild-type p53 HepG2 cells revealed key role p53 oroxylin adriamycin-mediated glycolytic metabolism regulation. Transfecting wt p53 plasmid p53-deficient H1299 cells could inverse metabolic characteristics regulated oroxylin A. study revealed new aspect glucose metabolism regulation oroxylin A, may contribute new anticancer mechanism.
