 two common Gaucher disease mutations Ashkenazi population, 1226A-->G 84G-->GG glucocerebrosidase gene, tightly linked marker nearby pyruvate kinase gene. paper develops simulation Ashkenazi population considers effects selection drift mutant allele frequency recombinant haplotype frequency time. Although fraction mutants linked original marker decays exponentially average, expected value likely occur. Instead, due random loss recombinant haplotype, mutation significant probability retaining complete linkage disequilibrium long origin, may large errors estimating age mutation based linkage data. simulations show 1226G mutation probably originated 40 1000 generations ago (1000 25,000 years ago), 84GG mutation probably originated 50 4800 generations ago (1300 120,000 years ago). recent origin 1226G mutation high current allele frequency provide strong evidence heterozygote selection. New techniques results developed paper general applicability toward analyzing linkage disequilibrium near mutations. example, potentially explain unexpected pattern linkage disequilibrium seen around DeltaF508 mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.
