 Pyruvate kinase rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme. PKM1 PKM2 isoforms result mutually exclusive alternative splicing PKM pre-mRNA. PKM2 rather PKM1 regulates Warburg effect tumorigenesis poorly understood mechanisms. Emerging evidence revealed ERK1/2 phosphorylates PKM2, PKM1, leading PIN1-dependent cis-trans isomerization conversion PKM2 tetramer monomer. Monomeric PKM2 translocates nucleus, functions histone kinase upregulates expression c-Myc cyclin D1, thereby promoting Warburg effect cell cycle progression, respectively. Thus, nuclear PKM2 essential tumorigenesis may serve target treating human cancer.
