 Plasmodium vivax geographically widespread human malaria parasite causing approximately 130-435 million infections annually. economic burden many parts world poses public health challenge along Plasmodium sp. biology parasite less studied poorly understood, spite facts. Emerging evidence severe complications due infections parasite provides impetus focus research same. Investigating parasite directly infected patients best way study biology pathogenic mechanisms. Gene expression studies parasite directly obtained patients provided evidence gene regulation resulting varying amount transcript levels different blood stages. mechanisms regulating gene expression malaria parasites well understood. Discovery Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) Plasmodium falciparum suggested might play important role regulating gene expression. report genome-wide occurrence NATs P. vivax parasites patients differing clinical symptoms. total 1348 NATs annotated gene loci detected using custom designed microarray strand specific probes. Majority NATs identified study shows positive correlation expression pattern sense (S) transcript. data also shows condition specific expression patterns varying antisense (AS) transcript levels. Genes transcripts enrich various biological processes. knowledge first report presence NATs P. vivax obtained infected patients different disease complications. data suggests differential regulation gene expression diverse clinical conditions, shown differing sense/antisense ratios would lead future detailed investigations gene regulation.
