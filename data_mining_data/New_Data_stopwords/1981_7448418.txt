 Alveolar peritoneal macrophages differ energy metabolism. Alveolar macrophages mainly aerobic whereas peritoneal macrophages mainly anaerobic energy generation. investigated question whether differences metabolism preprogrammed subsets macrophage precursors bone marrow, develop proliferating cells consequence exposure different tissue environments. progeny single mouse macrophage progenitor cells grown vitro 4 days; resultant colonies divided two roughly equal populations, cultured either high low oxygen environment corresponding alveoli tissues. Following 4 days incubation 5% 20% O2, activities two glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate kinase (PK) two- threefold higher half colonies grown low O2 environment, whereas activity oxidative phosphorylative enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) two- threefold higher half colony grown aerobic environment. Re-exposure cells low O2 environment high O2 conditions additional 4 days caused rise GDH activity decrease LDH PK. recovery GDH activity re-exposure time dependent. results support theory macrophages arising single progenitor cell develop different metabolic features depending O2 environment mature. single precursor cell give rise mature cells metabolic characteristic either alveolar tissue macrophages.
