 Photosynthesis Warburg effect (O(2) inhibition photosynthesis) evaluated preparations intact spinach chloroplasts enriched varying amounts lysed chloroplasts. Increasing ratio broken intact plastids resulted decreased rates CO(2) assimilation.Hydrogen peroxide added 10 micromolar also inhibited photosynthesis preparations. Inhibition photosynthetic rate factors eliminated addition catalase. findings indicate H(2)O(2) presumably generated broken chloroplasts causal agent inhibition.The Warburg effect also became pronounced increasing level broken intact chloroplasts. effect examined function added catalase, pH, O(2) concentration. 21% O(2) 0.44 0.68 millimolar CO(2), catalase relieved effect almost completely pH 7.5, pH 8.3, rate restored half less control. pH 7.6, 0.44 millimolar CO(2), 100% O(2), effect slightly overcome catalase.A rise glycolate synthesis isolated spinach chloroplast shown previously coupled increase pH O(2) (Kow, Robinson, Gibbs 1977 Plant Physiol 60: 492-495; Robinson, Gibbs, Cotler 1977 Plant Physiol 59: 530-534). 21% O(2), glycolate synthesis affected addition catalase pH 7.5 8.3. proposed 21% O(2) without means removing H(2)O(2), portion Warburg effect attributed glycolate synthesis overestimated pH values order 7.5. contrast, portion Warburg effect was, alkaline pH, insensitive catalase represented stress placed upon photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle resulted enhanced synthesis glycolate. 100% O(2) aeration pH 7.5 8.5, Warburg effect may also represent O(2)-mediated inhibition Calvin cycle enzyme within intact plastid.
