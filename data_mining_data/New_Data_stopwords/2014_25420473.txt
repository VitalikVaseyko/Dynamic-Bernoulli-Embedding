 BACKGROUND: reverse Warburg effect describes phenomenon epithelial cancer cells take advantage metabolic machinery nearby cancer-associated fibroblast, inducing produce lactate ketones fuel high metabolic demands epithelial tumour tissues. breast cancer observed lack stromal caveolin-1 (CAV-1) increased expression monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT-4) tumour stroma, concomitant increase expression monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) epithelial, tumour compartment. lack CAV-1 increased expression MCT-4 shown prognostic importance, primarily patients breast cancer. However, phenomenon scarcely described oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Given prognostic importance myofibroblasts OSCC, also examined potential relationship expression MCT-4 presence myofibroblasts. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissues 30 patients OSCC immunostained antibodies towards MCT-1, MCT-4, Cav-1, GLUT-1, alpha-SMA, TOMM20 KI-67, evaluated specific epithelial stromal expression. RESULTS CONCLUSIONS: patients OSCC, find increased expression MCT-1 MCT-4 epithelial stromal compartment, almost overlap spatial expression. found large spatial overlap alpha-SMA MCT-1 stroma compartment, relationship MCT-4 myofibroblasts. Interestingly, observe relationship absence CAV-1 presence MCT-4 shown breast carcinomas.
