 1. metabolism glucose, glutamine ketone-bodies studied small intestine rats 5 days hyperthyroidism. 2. Portal-drained visceral bloodflow increased 20.1% (P < 0.05) hyperthyroid rats accompanied decrease arteriovenous concentration difference glutamine (25.7%, P < 0.05), glutamate (22.0%, P < 0.05), alanine (20.9%, P < 0.05) ammonia (20.6%, P < 0.05) increase glucose (27.2%, P < 0.05), lactate (28.9%, P < 0.05) ketone-bodies (163.2%, P < 0.001). 3. gut hyperthyroid rats showed increased rates extraction glucose, lactate ketone-bodies. 4. Enterocytes isolated hyperthyroid rats showed increased rates utilization glucose ketone-bodies glutamine decreased. 5. maximal activities hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase oxoglutarate dehydrogenase increased (by 13.7-36.2%) intestinal mucosal scrapings hyperthyroid rats, whereas activity glutaminase decreased (22.1-31.4%). 6. concluded hyperthyroidism increases rates utilization glucose ketone-bodies decreases glutamine (both vivo vitro) epithelial cells small intestine.
