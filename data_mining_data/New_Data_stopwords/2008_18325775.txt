 Numerous investigations point importance oxidative imbalance mediating AD pathogenesis. Accumulated evidence indicates lipid peroxidation early event evolution disease occurs patients mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI represents condition increased risk Alzheimer's disease (AD), early detection disease markers investigation. Previously showed HNE-modified proteins, markers lipid peroxidation, elevated MCI hippocampus inferior parietal lobule compared controls. Using redox proteomic approach, report identity 11 HNE-modified proteins significantly elevated HNE levels MCI patients compared controls span brain regions: Neuropolypeptide h3, carbonyl reductase (NADPH), alpha-enolase, lactate dehydrogenase B, phosphoglycerate kinase, heat shock protein 70, ATP synthase alpha chain, pyruvate kinase, actin, elongation factor Tu, translation initiation factor alpha. enzyme activities lactate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, pyruvate kinase decreased MCI subjects compared controls, suggesting direct correlation oxidative damage impaired enzyme activity. suggest impairment target proteins production HNE adducts leads protein dysfunction eventually neuronal death, thus contributing biological events may lead MCI patients progress AD.
