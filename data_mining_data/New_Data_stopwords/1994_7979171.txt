 Early alterations cellular energy metabolism, reductive biosynthesis enzymes related cell proliferation studied 40 Wistar albino rats exposed acute level deoxycholate (DOC), fed different diets. animals divided four equal groups fed ad libitum either normal diet (ND), high-carbohydrate high-fibre (HCF) diet, high-protein high-fat (HPF) diet. Three times weekly intrarectal injection 40 mg/0.2 ml DOC given three groups rats 9 weeks. specific activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase significantly (p < 0.05) increased DOC-treated animals compared physiological saline-treated control. Reductive biosynthetic enzyme activities (malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase-NADP(+)-dependent, ATP-citrate lyase) reduced DOC-treated animals compared control. Feeding rats HCF diet significantly (p < 0.05) lowered specific activities enzymes glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative) hyaluronidase proteinase compared HPF-fed rats. results show altered enzymic profile rats fed HCF HPF diet compared rats fed ND suggests protective role HCF diet development colon cancer.
