 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency due mutations PKLR gene common cause hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Thus far, 55 different mutations described patients PK-deficient hemolytic anemia. Polymorphisms within PKLR gene tightly linked glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene suggest PK deficiency may represent balanced polymorphism.
