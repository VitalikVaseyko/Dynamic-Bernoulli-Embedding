 Pyruvate kinase isolated Neurospora purified homogeneity shown tetramer molecular weight around 242 000 gel filtration studies 239 000 daltons sedimentation equilibrium measurements. monomer produced treatment guanidine hydrochloride found 51 000-52 000 daltons sedimentation equilibrium studies; molecular weight 62 000 determined monomer generated SDS treatment electrophoresis SDS-polyacrylamide gels. enzyme isoelectric point 6.35-6.41; Substrate saturation kinetics PEP show variable extent cooperativity depending upon buffer ions employed assay. ADP effective phosphoryl group acceptor, GDP IDP poor substitutes. divalent cation, Mg-2+, required activity. low concentrations, Ca-2+ acts activator pyruvate kinase inhibitory high concentrations. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate potent allosteric activator, fructose 6-phosphate next order effectiveness. Valine powerful inhibitor. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan without effect individually, simultaneous presence results considerable activation. Alanine affect enzyme appreciably.
