 study evaluated effects administration vitamin D3 preparation 'Videchol' chronically irradiated rats (1 cGy day(-1)) assessment activities several glycolytic enzymes: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (EC 1.1.1.28), pyruvate kinase (PK) (EC 2.7.1.40) hexokinase (HK) (EC 2.7.1.1), populations erythroid myeloid bone marrow cells. Videchol treatment irradiated rats led normalisation HK LDH activity cumulative doses around 30 cGy granulocyte-monocyte cells normalisation LDH PK activities erythroid cells starting 20 cGy comparison irradiated rats receive Videchol. reaction kinetic parameters LDH erythrocytes changed according redistribution pattern isozymes throughout different stages experiment. administration Videchol irradiated rats led rearrangement LDH isozymes ratio characterised kinetic properties comparable controls. Thus, vitamin D3 appears induce normalisation carbohydrate metabolism rats chronically irradiated low dose-rate ionising radiation.
