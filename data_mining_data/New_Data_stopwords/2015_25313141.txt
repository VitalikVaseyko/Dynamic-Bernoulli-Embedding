 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) common hematological malignancy diagnosed children, blockade abnormally activated PI3Kdelta displayed promising outcomes B cell acute chronic leukemias, mechanisms well understood. report novel PI3Kdelta selective inhibitor X-370, displays distinct binding mode p110delta blocks constitutively active stimulus-induced PI3Kdelta signaling. X-370 significantly inhibited survival human B cell leukemia cells vitro, associated induction G1 phase arrest apoptosis. X-370 abrogated Akt Erk1/2 signaling via blockade PDK1 binding and/or phosphorylation MEK1/2. Forced expression constitutively active MEK1 attenuated antiproliferative activity X-370. X-370 preferentially inhibited survival primary pediatric B-ALL cells displaying PI3Kdelta-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation, combined inhibition PI3Kdelta MEK1/2 displayed enhanced activity. conclude PI3Kdelta inhibition led abrogation Akt Erk1/2 signaling via novel PI3K-PDK1/MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade, contributed efficacy B-ALL. findings support rationale clinical testing PI3Kdelta inhibitors pediatric B-ALL provide insights needed optimize therapeutic strategy.
