 INTRODUCTION: Cancers believed adapt continual changes glucose oxygen availability relying almost exclusively glycolytic metabolism energy (i.e. Warburg effect). process breast cancers sustain growth avascular tissue thought mediated via aberrant hypoxia response ensuing shifts glycolytic metabolism. Given role initiating perpetuating tumors, sought determine whether breast cancer stem progenitor cells play instrumental role adaptive metabolic response. METHODS: Breast cancer stem/progenitor cells isolated invasive ductal carcinomas, benign stem cells (SC) isolated reduction mammoplasty tissues. Relative expression 33 genes involved hypoxia glucose metabolism evaluated flow cytometrically isolated stem progenitor cell populations. Significance cohorts cell populations determined using Student's 2-tailed test. RESULTS: benign stem/progenitor cells exhibited significant inter-group differences expression genes involved hypoxia regulation glucose metabolism, breast cancer stem/progenitor cells demonstrated significant inter-group variability. Breast cancer stem/progenitor cells adapted microenvironments changes stem cell numbers transcription glycolytic genes. One four breast cancer stem/progenitor cells subpopulations exhibited aerobic glycolysis gene expression signature. subpopulation comprises majority tumor therefore best reflects invasive ductal carcinoma tumor biology. Although PI3K/AKT mutations associated increased proliferation breast cancer cells, mutations breast cancer stem/progenitor cells subpopulations correlate changes metabolic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: adaptive capacity breast cancer stem/progenitor cells may enable tumors survive variable conditions encountered progressive stages cancer growth.
