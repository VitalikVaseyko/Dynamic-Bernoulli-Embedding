 Metastasis primary cause death many tumors, novel anti-metastatic therapies necessary. Recently, showed metastatic tumors down-regulate key oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes favor glycolysis, enhancement Warburg effect. Therefore, sought determine restriction glycolysis using 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) would lead increased utilization OXPHOS inhibition metastatic phenotype. Noncytotoxic concentrations 2DG dose-dependently inhibited vitro migration invasion highly metastatic DLM8-luc-M1 osteosarcoma (OS) cell line, well metastatic human, canine, murine cancer cells different histotypes. associated cytoskeletal rearrangement inhibition cathepsin L expression. dose-dependent shift toward OXPHOS confirmed demonstrating increased oxygen utilization decreased lactate production 2DG treated cells. Finally, 2DG treatment significantly delayed metastasis prolonged survival orthotopic postsurgical OS model. conclusion, work suggests forcing cells away glycolysis may inhibit key components metastatic phenotype, providing novel avenue metastasis prevention.
