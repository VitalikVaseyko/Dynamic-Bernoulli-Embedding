 blood patient deficiency hexokinase red cells decreased concentration 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate red cells showed increased affinity oxygen, whereas patient deficiency pyruvate kinase elevated concentration 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate red cells blood decreased affinity oxygen. Defects red cell glycolysis may alter oxygen affinity blood virtue effect 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations red cells.
