 Primary resistance induction therapy unsolved clinical problem acute myeloid leukemia (AML). investigated drug resistance AML level cellular metabolism order identify early predictors therapeutic response. Using extracellular flux analysis, compared metabolic drug responses AML cell lines sensitive resistant cytarabine sorafenib 24h drug treatment small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line exposed etoposide. drug-resistant AML cells maintained oxidative metabolism upon drug exposure SCLC cells displayed overall metabolic shift towards glycolysis, i.e. Warburg effect escape drug toxicity. Moreover, primary AML blasts displayed low glycolytic activity, oxygen consumption readily detectable, indicating essential role oxidative pathways bioenergetics AML blasts. line observations, analysis mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester staining flow cytometry allowed clear discrimination drug sensitive resistant AML cell line clones primary blasts 24h treatment cytarabine sorafenib. data reveal distinct metabolic phenotype resistant AML cells suggest disrupting oxidative metabolism rather glycolysis may enhance cytotoxic effects chemotherapy AML.
