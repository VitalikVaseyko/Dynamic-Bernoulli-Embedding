 1. Pigeon erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) purified 22,000 fold successive column chromatography Sephadex DEAE A-50 Red Agarose. resulting enzyme preparation specific activity 815.3 U/mg protein overall yield 18.5%. 2. molecular weight, determined gel filtration Sephadex G-200 152,000. 3. Isoelectric focusing pH range 3-10 showed pigeon erythrocyte contained least 3 PK isozymes isoelectric points 5, 5.7 6. 4. variation activity PK various ADP phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentrations studied. Km values ADP PEP 0.40 0.46 mM respectively. 5. enzyme activated FDP, inhibited ATP, highly phosphorylated inositol derivatives 2,3-DPG: 6. activated K+ Mg2+ ions. 7. Phosphorylated hexoses Pi stimulated activity PK. 8. regulatory role PK pigeon erythrocytes, lack typical 2,3-DPG bypass, discussed.
