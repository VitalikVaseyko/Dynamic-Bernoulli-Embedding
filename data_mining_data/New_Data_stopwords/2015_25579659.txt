 study investigated effects grafting carbohydrate status enzymes carbohydrate metabolism self-grafted grafted cucumber seedlings using salt-tolerant pumpkin rootstock 'Qingzhen 1' (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata) 80 mM Ca(NO3)2 stress 6 d. growth self-grafted seedlings significantly inhibited treatment Ca(NO3)2 stress, whereas inhibition growth alleviated pumpkin rootstock-grafted seedlings. Ca(NO3)2 stress increased contents total soluble sugar, sucrose fructose, decreased starch content rootstock-grafted leaves. However, compared self-grafted plants, rootstock-grafted seedlings observed higher content sucrose total soluble sugar (TSS) salt stress. Rootstock-grafted seedlings exhibited higher activities acid invertase (AI), neutral invertase (NI) phosphate sucrose synthase (SPS) sucrose metabolism leaves self-grafted seedlings salinity. Moreover, activities fructokinase (FK), hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK) glycolysis maintained higher level leaves rootstock-grafted seedlings Ca(NO3)2 stress. Additionally, rootstock-grafting decrease high percentage enhancement key enzymes gene expression glycolysis scion leaves cucumber seedlings induced salt stress. results suggest rootstock-grafting improved salt tolerance, might play role elevated sucrose metabolism glycolytic pathway regulated pumpkin rootstock.
