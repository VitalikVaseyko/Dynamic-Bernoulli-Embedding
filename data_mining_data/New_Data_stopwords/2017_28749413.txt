 proliferation metastasis, tumor cells prefer glycolysis (Warburg effect), exact mechanism remains largely unknown. study, demonstrated phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) important enzyme pathway metabolic glycolysis. observed significant overexpression PGK1 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, correlation PGK1 expression poor survival hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Also, depletion PGK1 dramatically reduced cancer cell proliferation metastasis, indicating oncogenic role PGK1 liver cancer progression. experiments showed PGK1 played important role MYC-induced metabolic reprogramming, led enhanced Warburg effect. results revealed new effect PGK1, provide new treatment strategy hepatocellular carcinoma, PGK1 used indicate prognosis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
