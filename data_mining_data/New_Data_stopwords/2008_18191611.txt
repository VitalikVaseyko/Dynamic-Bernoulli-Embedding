 Oct-4 gene encodes transcription factor plays important role maintaining pluripotent state embryonic stem cells may prevent expression genes activated differentiation. Although role maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency well established, still little known binding partners regulate function. identify proteins control Oct-4 function, used affinity chromatography immobilized Oct-4 (POU) together MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight) MS (mass spectrometry) isolated novel Oct-4-interacting protein, pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2 M2-PK). PKM2 isozyme pyruvate kinase specifically expressed proliferating cells, embryonic stem cells, embryonic carcinoma cells, well cancer cells. Oct-4 PKM2 co-affinity precipitated cell extracts, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed POU DNA binding domain Oct-4 required interaction PKM2. addition, C-terminal domain PKM2 (amino acids 307-531) involved binding Oct-4. Moreover, ectopic expression PKM2 enhanced Oct-4-mediated transcription. observations indicate transactivation potential Oct-4 transcription factor positively modulated PKM2.
