 Two children nonspherocytic anaemia pyruvate kinase deficiency diagnosis delayed due normal initial estimations enzyme activity. Repeated analyses involving glycolytic enzymes documented increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity function high reticulocyte counts. pyruvate kinase activity showed subnormal values. simple comparison enzyme activities true pyruvate kinase activity 50% estimated thus rendering diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency highly probable. Analyses one glycolytic enzyme performed young children otherwise unexplained haemolysis associated high reticulocyte counts.
