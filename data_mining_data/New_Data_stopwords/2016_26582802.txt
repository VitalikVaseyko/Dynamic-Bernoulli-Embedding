 environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) elicits dose-dependent hepatotoxicity includes fat accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis may progress hepatocellular carcinoma. investigate effects, RNA-Seq data integrated computationally identified putative dioxin response elements, complementary targeted metabolomic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ChIP-Seq data female C57BL/6 mice gavaged TCDD every 4 days 28 days. Data integration using CytoKEGG manual curation identified dose-dependent alterations central carbon amino acid metabolism. specifically, TCDD increased pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) gene protein expression. PKM2 lower catalytic activity resulting decreased glycolytic flux accumulation upstream intermediates redirected pentose phosphate pathway serine/folate biosynthesis, 2 important NADPH producing pathways stemming glycolysis. addition, GAC:KGA glutaminase (GLS1) protein isoform ratio increased, consistent increases glutaminolysis serves anaplerotic role TCA cycle compensates reduced glycolytic flux. Collectively, gene expression, protein, metabolite changes indicative increases NADPH production support cytochrome P450 activity ROS defenses. AhR-mediated metabolic reprogramming similar Warburg effect represents novel advantageous defense mechanism increase anti-oxidant capacity normal differentiated hepatocytes.
