 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salacia oblonga root (SOR) traditionally herbal medicine obesity diabetes, closely associated fatty liver. investigate molecular mechanisms SOR treatment dietary-induced fatty liver. MATERIALS METHODS: Male rats co-administered fructose drinking water vehicle aqueous-ethanolic extract SOR (by gavage, daily) 10 weeks. Biochemical variables determined enzymatically ELISA. Gene expression analyzed Real-Time PCR and/or Western blot. RESULTS: SOR treatment (20mg/kg) diminished fructose-induced fatty liver indicated decreases excess triglyceride accumulation increased vacuolization Oil Red staining area livers rats. Importantly, Hepatic gene expression profile revealed SOR suppressed fructose-stimulated overexpression sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1/1c mRNA nuclear protein. accord, overexpression SREBP-1c-responsive genes, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, also downregulated. contrast, overexpressed nuclear protein carbohydrate response element binding protein mRNA target gene liver pyruvate kinase altered. Additionally, SOR also affect expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma- -alpha, well target genes, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a, acyl-CoA oxidase CD36. CONCLUSIONS: results suggest modulation hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c-mediated gene expression contributes SOR-elicited improvement fructose-induced fatty liver rats. findings provide better understanding SOR treatment obesity diabetes.
