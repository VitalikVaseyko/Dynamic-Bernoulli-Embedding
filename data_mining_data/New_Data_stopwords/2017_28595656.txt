 BACKGROUND: melanoma patients BRAF(V600E) positive tumors respond well combination BRAF kinase MEK inhibitors. However, patients intrinsically resistant majority patients eventually develop drug resistance treatment. patients insufficiently responding BRAF MEK inhibitors, ongoing need new treatment targets. Cellular metabolism promising new target line: mutant BRAF(V600E) shown affect metabolism. METHODS: Time course experiments series western blots performed panel BRAF(V600E) BRAF(WT)/NRAS(mut) human melanoma cells, incubated BRAF MEK1 kinase inhibitors. siRNA approaches used investigate metabolic players involved. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) measured confocal microscopy AZD7545, inhibitor targeting PDKs (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) tested. RESULTS: show inhibition RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway induces phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase PDH-E1alpha subunit BRAF(V600E) BRAF(WT)/NRAS(mut) harboring cells. Inhibition BRAF, MEK1 siRNA knock-down ERK1/2 mediated phosphorylation PDH. siRNA-mediated knock-down PDKs use DCA (a pan-PDK inhibitor) abolished PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation. BRAF inhibitor treatment also induced upregulation ROS, concomitantly induction PDH phosphorylation. Suppression ROS MitoQ suppressed PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation, strongly suggesting ROS mediate activation PDKs. Interestingly, inhibition PDK1 AZD7545 specifically suppressed growth BRAF-mutant BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF(V600E) BRAF(WT)/NRAS(mut) melanoma cells, increased production ROS upon inhibition RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, responsible activating PDKs, turn phosphorylate inactivate PDH. part possible salvage pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle inhibited leading reduced oxidative metabolism reduced ROS levels. show inhibition PDKs AZD7545 leads growth suppression BRAF-mutated -inhibitor resistant melanoma cells. Thus small molecule PDK inhibitors AZD7545, might promising drugs combination treatment melanoma patients activating RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway mutations (50% BRAF, 25% NRAS(mut), 11.9% NF1(mut)).
