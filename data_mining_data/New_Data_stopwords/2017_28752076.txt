 Introduction: Cancer intricate disorder/dysfunction cells defined genetic heterogeneity human disease. Therefore, characterized several adaptive complex hallmarks. Among them, pH dysregulation appears symbol aberrant functions within tumor microenvironment (TME). comparison normal tissues, solid tumors, face irregular acidification alkalinization extracellular intracellular fluids. Methods: study, comprehensively discussed recent reports hallmarks solid tumors provide deep insights upon molecular machineries involved pH dysregulation solid tumors impacts initiation progression cancer. Results: dysregulation pH solid tumors fundamentally related Warburg effect hypoxia, leading expression number molecular machineries, including: NHE1, H+ pump V-ATPase, CA-9, CA-12, MCT-1, GLUT-1. Activation proton exchangers transporters (PETs) gives rise formation TME. condition favors cancer cells evade anoikis apoptosis, granting aggressive metastasis phenotype, well resistance chemotherapy radiation therapy. review aimed discuss key molecular changes tumor cells terms bio-energetics cancer metabolism relation pH dysregulation. phenomenon, intra- extracellular metabolites altered and/or disrupted. molecular alterations provide molecular hallmarks direct targeting PETs potent relevant inhibitors combination conventional cancer therapies ultimate therapy solid tumors. Conclusion: Taken all, along treatment strategies, targeting key molecular machineries related intra- extracellular metabolisms within TME proposed novel strategy inhibit block PETs involved pH dysregulation solid tumors.
