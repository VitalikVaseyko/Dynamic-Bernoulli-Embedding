 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonists, including glitazone class drugs, insulin sensitizers reduce glucose lipid levels patients type 2 diabetes mellitus. fully understand molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic actions, characterized effects potent, tyrosine-based PPAR gamma ligand GW1929 serum glucose lipid parameters gene expression Zucker diabetic fatty rats. time-course studies, GW1929 treatment decreased circulating FFA levels reducing glucose triglyceride levels. used comprehensive unbiased messenger RNA profiling technique identify genes regulated either directly indirectly PPAR gamma epididymal white adipose tissue, interscapular brown adipose tissue, liver, soleus skeletal muscle. PPAR gamma activation stimulated expression large number genes involved lipogenesis fatty acid metabolism white adipose tissue brown adipose tissue. muscle, PPAR gamma agonist treatment decreased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, represses oxidative glucose metabolism, also decreased expression genes involved fatty acid transport oxidation. changes suggest molecular basis PPAR gamma-mediated increases glucose utilization muscle. liver, PPAR gamma activation coordinately decreased expression genes involved gluconeogenesis. conclude studies antidiabetic actions PPAR gamma agonists probably consequence 1) effects FFA levels, 2), coordinate effects gene expression multiple insulin-sensitive tissues.
