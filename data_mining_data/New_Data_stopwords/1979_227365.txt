 1. Pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inactivated phosphorylation (MgATP2-) alpha-chain decarboxylase component. Three serine residues may phosphorylated, one (site 1) major inactivating site. 2. relative rates phosphorylation site 1 greater 2 greater site 3. 3. kinetics inactivating phosphorylation investigated measuring inactivation complex MgATP2-. apparent Km Mg complex ATP 25.5 microM; ADP competitive inhibitor (Ki 69.8 microM) sodium pyruvate uncompetitive inhibitor (Ki 2.8 microM). Inactivation accelerated increasing concentration ratios NADH/NAD+ acetyl-CoA/CoA. 4. kinetics additional phosphorylations (predominantly site 2 conditions) investigated measurement 32P incorporation non-radioactive pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate containing 3-6% active complex, assumed parrallel experiments 32P labelling contain 91% protein-bound phosphate site 1 9% site 2. 5. apparent Km Mg complex ATP 10.1 microM; ADP competitive inhibitor (Ki 31.5 microM) sodium pyruvate uncompetitive inhibitor (Ki 1.1 mM). 6. Incorporation accelerated increasing concentration ratios NADH/NAD+ acetyl-CoA/CoA, although less marked highest ratios.
