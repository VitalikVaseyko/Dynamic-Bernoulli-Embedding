 BACKGROUND: Mechanisms addition diastolic calcium overload may contribute diastolic dysfunction hypertrophied hearts. study, tested hypothesis failure maintain low ADP concentration hypertrophied hearts contributes diastolic dysfunction inhibiting rate cross-bridge cycling. METHODS RESULTS: perfusing isolated rat hearts pyruvate 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), able perturb [ADP] minimal changes [ATP] [inorganic phosphate] contribution glycolytic ATP ATP synthesis. effects 2DG compared aortic-banded (LVH, n=5) sham-operated (control, n=5) rat hearts. 31P NMR spectroscopy used measure concentrations phosphorus-containing compounds. found threefold increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) LVH 2DG perfusion, increase concomitant threefold increase intracellular free [ADP]. [ADP] control hearts maintained <40 micromol/L, change LVEDP observed. linear relationship increases [ADP] LVEDP found (r2=.66, P=.001). Furthermore, capacity creatine kinase reaction, major mechanism maintaining low [ADP], decreased LVH (P=.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased [ADP] contributes diastolic dysfunction LVH, possibly due slowed cross-bridge cycling. Decreased capacity creatine kinase reaction rephosphorylate ADP likely contributing mechanism failure maintain low [ADP] LVH.
