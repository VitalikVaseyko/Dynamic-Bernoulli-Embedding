 authors describe assay measure generation adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) resulting phosphorylation substrate kinase. ADP accumulation detected conversion fluorescent signal via coupled enzyme system. technology potential applications assessment inhibitor potency mode action well kinetic analysis enzyme activity. assay wide dynamic range (0.25-75 microM) validated several kinases including highly active cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKAalpha), casein kinase 1 (CK1), weakly active kinase Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (Jnk2alpha2). Kinase activity measured either end point continuous mode. Assay performance end point mode compared adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) depletion assay continuous mode pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay. ability characterize kinase kinetics demonstrated deriving ATP/substrate affinity (Michaelis-Menten constant; K(m)) values PKAalpha, CK1, Jnk2alpha2. assay readily measured activity kinase reactions using protein substrates, indicating suitability use large macromolecules. wide range inhibitor activities could determined even presence high ATP concentrations, making assay highly suitable characterize mode action inhibitor question. Collectively, assay provides homogenous, generic method number applications kinase drug discovery.
