 Using relatively primitive tools 1920s, Otto Warburg demonstrated tumor cells show increased dependence glycolysis meet energy needs, regardless whether well-oxygenated not. High rates glucose uptake, fueling glycolysis, used clinically identify cancer cells. However, Warburg effect account metabolic diversity observed amongst cancer cells influences might direct diversity. Modern tools shown oncogenes, variable hypoxia levels, utilization different carbon sources affect tumor evolution. influences may produce metabolic symbiosis, lactate hypoxic, glycolytic tumor cell population fuels ATP production oxygenated region tumor. Lactate, considered waste product glycolysis, important metabolite oxidative phosphorylation many tissues. much known muscle brain use lactate oxidative phosphorylation, contribution lactate tumor bioenergetics less defined. refocused perspective cancer metabolism recognizes metabolic diversity within tumor offers novel therapeutic targets cancer cells may starved fuel sources, thereby become sensitive traditional cancer treatments.
