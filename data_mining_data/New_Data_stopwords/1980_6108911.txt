 Inhibition IMP dehydrogenase AS-30D hepatoma cells suspension culture resulted pronounced selective reduction guanine nucleotide pools. Total acid-soluble guanine nucleotides decreased 40% content GTP GDP dropped 20% control within 4 h mycophenolate ribavirin used inhibitors. Induction GTP deficiency associated 50% rise UTP uracil nucleotides. Guanosine rapidly reversed reduction guanine nucleotide pools elevation cellular UTP contents. Enzymatic nucleotide analyses cell tissue extracts treatment ribavirin indicated ribavirin 5'-triphosphate effective substrate yeast hexokinase, yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, nucleosidediphosphate kinase yeast bovine liver. results confirmed detail use synthetic ribavirin 5'-triphosphate 5'-diphosphate. latter nucleotide analog also substrate pyruvate kinase muscle. Mycophenolate-induced GTP deficiency associated arrest hepatoma cell growth suspension culture. Ribavirin, equimolar concentration, much less effective respect. None two inhibitors detectable effect, however, vivo guanine uracil nucleotides assayed liver. indicated inhibition de novo guanylate synthesis vivo compensated salvage pathway synthesis.
