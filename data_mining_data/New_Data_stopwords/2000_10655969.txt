 effects diet composition ration size activities key enzymes involved intermediary metabolism studied liver gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). High-carbohydrate, low-protein diets stimulated 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) enzyme activities, decreased alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2) activity. high degree correlation found food ration size activity enzymes 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (positive correlations) fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) (negative correlation). correlations matched well high correlation also found ration size growth rate starved fish refed 22 d. Limited feeding (5 g/kg body weight) 22 decreased activities key enzymes glycolysis lipogenesis, alanine aminotransferase activity. findings presented indicate high level metabolic adaptation diet type ration size. particular, adaptation enzyme activities consumption diet high carbohydrate level suggests carnivorous fish like Sparus aurata tolerate partial replacement protein carbohydrate commercial diets supplied culture. relationship enzyme activities, ration size fish growth indicates enzymes quickly respond dietary manipulations cultured fish.
