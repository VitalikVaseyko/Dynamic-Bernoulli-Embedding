 study, effects bitter yam sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin intestinal disaccharidases renal enzymes diabetic rats investigated. Diabetic male Wistar rats fed diets supplemented 1% sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin 3 weeks. Plasma glucose, intestinal disaccharidases activities transaminases, acid phosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, ATP citrate lyase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase assessed level metabolic changes kidney diabetic rats. Sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin supplementation resulted significant decrease lactase maltase activities three regions intestine compared diabetic control group. However, test diets significantly reduced intestinal sucrase activity proximal mid regions. Test diets supplementation resulted significant decrease activities transaminases compared normal diabetic control groups. activity glucose-6-phosphatase significantly increased activities ATP citrate lyase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase significantly reduced kidney diabetic control rats compared normal group. Test diets supplementation significantly alter glucose-6-phosphatase, ATP citrate lyase pyruvate kinase activities compared diabetic control. However, significant increase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity toward normal group. conclusion, consumption bitter yam sapogenin extract commercial diosgenin demonstrated hypoglycemic properties, beneficial diabetes reducing intestinal disaccharidases activities; however, bitter yam sapogenin extract may adversely affect integrity kidney membrane.
