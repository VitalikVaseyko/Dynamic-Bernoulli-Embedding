 over-whelming evidence protein phosphorylations regulate cardiac function remodeling. wide variety protein kinases, e.g., phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, GSK-3, TGFbeta, PKA, MAPKs, PKC, Erks, Jaks, well phosphatases, e.g., phosphatase (PP1) calcineurin, control cardiomyocyte growth contractility. present work, used global phosphoprotein profiling identify phosphorylated proteins associated pressure overload (PO) cardiac hypertrophy heart failure. Phosphoproteins hypertrophic systolic failing hearts male hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats, trans-aortic banded (TAC), spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats analyzed. Profiling performed 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) phospho-enriched proteins. total 25 common phosphoproteins differences abundance (1) 3 hypertrophic and/or (2) 2 systolic failure heart models identified (CI>99%) matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) Mascot analysis. Among (1) myofilament proteins, including alpha-tropomyosin myosin regulatory light chain 2, cap Z interacting protein (cap ZIP), tubulin beta5; (2) mitochondrial proteins, including pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha, branch chain ketoacid dehydrogenase E1, mitochondrial creatine kinase; (3) phosphatases, including protein phosphatase 2A protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit; (4) proteins including proteosome subunits alpha type 3 beta type 7, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (eIF1A). results include previously described novel phosphoproteins cardiac hypertrophy systolic failure.
