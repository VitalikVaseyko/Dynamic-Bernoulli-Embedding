 1. Kinetic immunological studies well electrophoretic behaviour indicated pyruvate kinase Reuber H35 hepatoma cells M2-type. 2. Addition 0.1 microM insulin 2 mM fructose incubation medium 72 hr increased activity M2-type pyruvate kinase Reuber H35 hepatoma cells 103 25% respectively. 3. Incorporation studies [3H]leucine followed immunoprecipitation showed apparent rate synthesis M2-type pyruvate kinase increased insulin fructose. 4. Degradation studies indicated addition insulin fructose incubation medium increased half-life M2-type pyruvate kinase 4.8 8.6 6.8 hr respectively.
