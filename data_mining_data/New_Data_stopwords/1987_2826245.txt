 Fru 2,6-P2 present isolated foetal hepatocytes concentration 1.6 nmol per g cells. foetal hepatocytes exposed glucagon changes observed either concentration Fru 2,6-P2 lactate release activities 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pyruvate kinase. Incubation purified 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase catalytic subunit protein kinase change enzyme activity. inhibition sn-glycerol 3-phosphate much lower foetal adult enzyme. results suggest isoenzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase foetal hepatocytes different adult hepatocytes may present.
