 Two common characteristics active site structures intermediate complexes formed kinase reactions observed magnetic resonance techniques. First, creatine, arginine, adenylate pyruvate kinases (EC2.73.2, 2.7.3.3, 2.7.4.3 2.7.1.40, respectively) water progressively excluded structure active site progressively immobilized reactant successively added enzyme, monitored electron spin resonance (e.s.r) enhancement proton relaxation rate water (PRR) due paramagnetic manganese(II) probe. Significant, often wide-spread, changes protein conformation accompanying successive additions reaction components shown 1H n.m.r. studies pyruvate kinase. second characteristic that, ternary enzyme-Mn-nucleotide complexes, two parameters, e.s.r. spectrum PRR enhancement values, fall within range 10% enzymes investigated, exception bovine brain creatine kinase. similarities suggest homology teriary structure active sites enzymes. unsuspected aspect substrate cofactor specificity revealed e.s.r. spectroscopy manganese(II) complexes transition-state analogue creatine kinase (E-MnADP-formate-creatine) ternary phosphoenolpyruvate complex. former case, replacement ADP, normal substrate, substrate analogues IDP 2acute-deoxyadenosine diphosphate produced two interconvertible species transition-state analogue complexes, observed e.s.r. spectra isotropic species highly anisotropic species. normal substrate, anisotropic species observed. Similarly, case complex pyruvate kinase-Mn-phosphoenolpyruvate, normal monovalent activator K+ replaced inert tetramethylammonium ion, two interconvertible species rather normal one species observed e.s.r. spectroscopy. implications phenomena relation specificity catalytic efficiency discussed.
