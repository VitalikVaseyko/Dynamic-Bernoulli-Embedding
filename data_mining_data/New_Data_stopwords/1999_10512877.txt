 Coiled bodies discrete nuclear organelles often identified marker protein p80-coilin. coilin detected cytoplasm immunofluorescence Western blotting, considered exclusively nuclear protein. Xenopus germinal vesicle (GV), coilin actually resides nucleoplasm, although highly concentrated 50-100 coiled bodies. affinity-purified anti-coilin antibodies injected cytoplasm oocytes, could detected coiled bodies within 2-3 h. Coiled bodies intensely labeled 18 h, whereas nuclear organelles remained negative. nuclear envelope allow passive diffusion immunoglobulins, observation suggests anti-coilin antibodies imported nucleus antigen-antibody complex coilin. Newly synthesized coilin required, cycloheximide effect nuclear import subsequent targeting antibodies. Additional experiments myc-tagged coilin myc-tagged pyruvate kinase confirmed coilin shuttling protein. shuttling Nopp140, NO38/B23, nucleolin easily demonstrated targeting respective antibodies nucleoli, whereas anti-SC35 enter germinal vesicle. suggest coilin, perhaps association Nopp140, may function part transport system cytoplasm coiled bodies.
