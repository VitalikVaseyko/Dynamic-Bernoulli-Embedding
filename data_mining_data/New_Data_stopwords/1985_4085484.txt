 studies carried male Wistar rats subjected running within electric rotating drum. animals divided four experimental groups, differing one another duration training. training session lasted 30 days. first group daily run lasted 3 min, second group 5 min; third group, 1 min run first day, one min longer successive day; fourth group 2 min run first day two min longer successive day. determinations made prior training included peripheral blood erythrocyte (Er) reticulocyte (Ret.) count, hemoglobin concentration (Hb) packed cell volume (PCV) and, determined spectrophotometric methods, activity pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) glutathione reductase (GR). Training induced improvement enzymatic activities. heavier physical exertion, intensive enzymatic activity red blood cells, due intensification bone marrow erythropoetic activity physical exertion appearance young red cells peripheral blood. experimental groups revealed drop erythrocyte count (Er), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit values (PCV), well increase reticulocytes count (Ret) activity enzymes investigated. fourth group anemia detected: prolonged endurance training decreased RBC 24.2%, Hb 31.1%, PCV 26.2% increased reticulocyte count 881.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
