 use energy restriction mimetic agents (ERMAs) selectively target cancer cells addicted glycolysis could promising therapeutic approach. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) synthetic agonists nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma developed treat type II diabetes. compounds also display anticancer effects appear mainly independent PPARgamma agonist activity molecular mechanisms involved anticancer action yet well understood. Results obtained ciglitazone derivatives, mainly prostate cancer cell models, suggest compounds could act ERMAs. present paper, introduce compounds like 2-deoxyglucose target Warburg effect discuss possibility PPARgamma-independent effects various TZD could result action ERMAs.
