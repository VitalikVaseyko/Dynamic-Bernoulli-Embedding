 Recently, identified alginate-assimilating gene cluster genome Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01, member Bacteroidetes. Alginate lyase genes 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH) reductase gene cluster already characterized; however, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate (KDG) kinase 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase genes, i.e., flkin flald, still remained uncharacterized. amino acid sequences deduced flkin flald showed low identities corresponding enzymes Saccharophagus degradans 2-40(T), member Proteobacteria (Kim et al., Process Biochem., 2016). led us consider DEH-assimilating enzymes Bacteroidetes species somewhat deviated Proteobacteria species. Thus, present study, first assessed characteristics primary structures KDG kinase KDG aldolase strain UMI-01, investigated enzymatic properties recombinant enzymes, recFlKin recFlAld, expressed Escherichia coli expression system. Multiple-sequence alignment among KDG kinases KDG aldolases several Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes species indicated strain UMI-01 enzymes showed considerably low sequence identities (15%-25%) Proteobacteria enzymes, showed relatively high identities (47%-68%) Bacteroidetes enzymes. Phylogenetic analyses enzymes indicated distant relationship Proteobacteria enzymes Bacteroidetes enzymes, i.e., formed distinct clusters phylogenetic tree. recFlKin recFlAld produced genes flkin flald, respectively, confirmed show KDG kinase KDPG aldolase activities. Namely, recFlKin produced 1.7 mM KDPG reaction mixture containing 2.5 mM KDG 2.5 mM ATP 90-min reaction, recFlAld produced 1.2 mM pyruvate reaction mixture containing 5 mM KDPG equilibrium state. vitro alginate-metabolizing system constructed recFlKin, recFlAld, previously reported alginate lyases DEH reductase strain UMI-01 could convert alginate pyruvate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate efficiency 38%.
