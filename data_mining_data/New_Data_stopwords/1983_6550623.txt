 Synaptic membranes rat brain contain several calcium-requiring protein kinase (PK) activities different substrate specificities: (a) activity (CaH-PK) effective high concentrations Ca2+ ion absence Mg2+ (active class F substrates); (b) (Ca + Mg)-PK activity mediated Ca2+ ion presence Mg2+ (active class B substrates); (c) (Ca-CaM)-PK activities exhibit simultaneous requirements Ca2+ ion CaM (for class C substrates). Also described three activities (d-f) require Ca2+ ion: (d) Mg-PK activity presence Ca2+ causes inhibition phosphorylation (active class substrates); (e) activity affecting diverse group substrates (class E substrates), phosphorylation occurs presence Mg2+ ion alone (Mg-PK activity) unaffected addition Ca2+ ion CaM, substrates show different responses several types inhibitors; and, finally, (f) previously well characterized cAMP-dependent PK activities. Several substrates kinases identified fairly unambiguous manner: among P43 (class A), alpha subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase; P54 (class B), presynaptic protein B50; doublet P75-P80, proteins IA IB Ueda Greengard. interesting activity requiring Ca2+ CaM. half-maximal stimulation (K0.5) Ca2+ presence CaM found 1.0 microM Ca2+F untreated membranes. little change value prior EGTA extraction membranes, removes bulk Ca2+ reduces residual CaM greater equal 50%. apparent K0.5 CaM presence excess Ca2+ ion found equal 0.4 microgram per reaction mixture (8 micrograms/ml) 1.35 micrograms per reaction mixture (27 micrograms/ml), untreated EGTA-treated membranes, respectively.
