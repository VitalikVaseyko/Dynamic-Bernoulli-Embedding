 Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play important role development progression atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), cytokine secreted VSMCs macrophages atherosclerotic lesions, regulates variety cellular functions inflammatory cells VSMCs promoting cell growth motility, critical initiation progression vascularlesions. Alpha lipoic acid (ALA), well known antioxidant, acts pyruvate dehydrogenase cofactor mitochondrial metabolism. Recently, reported ALA many beneficial effects vascular cells atherosclerosis. aim current study examine VSMCs, treated 24 hours TNFalpha (10 ng/mL) presence absence ALA (2 mM), differential protein genes expression using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) DNA microarray analysis, respectively. Using 2-DE, identified proteins whose expression changed least 2.5-fold TNFalpha stimulation. Proteins up-regulated TNFalpha subsequently down-regulated presence ALA identified matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight mass spectrometry plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, fetal liver LKB-interacting protein, osteoblast-specific factor 2, glucosidase II, cyclin-dependent kinase 3, endoplasmin precursor glutathione synthetase. TNFalpha down-regulated proteins up-regulated presence ALA keratin 19, eukaryotic translation elongation factor Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarray tools confirmed up-regulation down-regulation some, all, proteins observed ALA challenged, TNFalpha-treated cells. data provide valuable information underlying mechanisms atherosclerosis.
