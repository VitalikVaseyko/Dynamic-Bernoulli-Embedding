 Transgenic mice hemizygously carrying human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene, Tg-rasH2 show sensitive facilitated carcinogenicity various carcinogens. study, activities certain enzymes related drug metabolism energy metabolism measured microsome cytosol fractions livers Tg-rasH2 mice wild type littermates sexes treated 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) phenobarbital (PB). Aminopyrine N-demethylase activities increased significantly livers mice treated PB. MC PB treatments induced significant increases activities UDP-glucuronosyltransferase S-adenosyl homocysteinase compared non-treated groups microsome fractions mice. cytosol fractions livers mice, glutathione S-transferase activity significantly induced PB treated groups. significant differences activities lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphatase related energy metabolism livers kidneys among mice. Tg-rasH2 mice showed stable activities enzymes related drug detoxication energy metabolism similar non-transgenic mice. results suggest human c-Ha-ras transgene may affect drug metabolism-related enzymes, facilitated carcinogenic response Tg-rasH2 mouse due enzymatic disorders.
