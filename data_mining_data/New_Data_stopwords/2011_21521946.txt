 Breast cancer progression metastasis driven complex reciprocal interactions, epithelial cancer cells surrounding stromal microenvironment. previously shown loss stromal Cav-1 expression associated increased risk early tumor recurrence, metastasis decreased overall survival. identify characterize signaling pathways activated Cav-1 negative tumor stroma, performed gene expression profiling using laser microdissected breast cancer-associated stroma. Tumor stroma laser capture microdissected 4 cases showing high stromal Cav-1 expression 7 cases loss stromal Cav-1. Briefly, identified 238 gene transcripts upregulated 232 gene transcripts downregulated stroma tumors showing loss Cav-1 expression (p </= 0.01 fold-change >/= 1.5). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed "stemness," inflammation, DNA damage, aging, oxidative stress, hypoxia, autophagy mitochondrial dysfunction tumor stroma patients lacking stromal Cav-1. findings consistent recently proposed "Reverse Warburg Effect" "Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model Cancer Metabolism." two complementary models, cancer cells induce oxidative stress adjacent stromal cells, forces stromal fibroblasts undergo autophagy/mitophagy aerobic glycolysis. This, turn, produces recycled nutrients (lactate, ketones glutamine) feed anabolic cancer cells, undergoing oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. results also consistent previous biomarker studies showing increased expression known autophagy markers (such ATG16L cathepsins) tumor stroma specifically associated metastatic tumor progression and/or poor clinical outcome.
