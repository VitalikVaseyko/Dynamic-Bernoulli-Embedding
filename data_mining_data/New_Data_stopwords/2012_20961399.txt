 INTRODUCTION: commonly used cardiac glycoside, digoxin (DIG), narrow therapeutic window. Although investigations made counteract toxic effects, alternate phytochemical available till date potent safer DIG. AIMS: main aim isolate novel cardenolide seeds Trigonella foenum graceium evaluate relative potential comparison DIG. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: one experiment effects isolated compound 2.5, 5.0, 10 mg/kg (p.o.) evaluated isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiovascular problems rats. test drug (TDR) reversed ISO-induced changes, subjected phytochemical analyses identified digoxigenin-3-O-rutin. another experiment effects DIG rutin (Rtn) compared TDR DIG alone. hydroxyl radical scavenging activity also measured electron spin resonance (EPR). RESULTS: digoxigenin-3-O-rutin 10 mg/kg markedly reduced ISO-induced increase cardiac lipid peroxidation levels serum creatinine phosphokinase-MB, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine. also reversed ISO-induced changes cardiac histomorphology. Interestingly TDR appeared effective DIG alone DIG Rtn combination. CONCLUSION: newly isolated digoxigenin-3-O-rutin appears potent safe digoxin. higher efficacy could due structural specificity might mediated better free radical scavenging action.
