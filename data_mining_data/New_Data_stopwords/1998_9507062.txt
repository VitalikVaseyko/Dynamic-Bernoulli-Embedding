 parasite Entamoeba histolytica organism whose main energetic source comes glycolysis. singularity several glycolytic enzymes use pyrophosphate alternative phosphate donor. Thus, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent enzyme, substitutes pyruvate kinase present humans. previously cloned sequenced gene codifies PPDK E. histolytica. report expression bacterial system purification 98% homogeneity. determined K(m) phosphoenolpyruvate, AMP PPi (21, < 5 100 microM, respectively). Unlike PPDK maize bacteria pyruvate kinase cells, EhPPDk dependent divalent cations require monovalent cations activity. enzyme optimum pH 6.0, labile low temperatures tetrameric structure. Since EhPPDK PPi-dependent enzyme, also tested effect pyrophosphate analogs inhibitors activity. Studies function structure enzyme may important therapeutic research several parasitic diseases, since counterpart humans.
