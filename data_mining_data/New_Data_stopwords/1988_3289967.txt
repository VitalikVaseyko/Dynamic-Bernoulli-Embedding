 Pyruvate kinase anaplastic medullary thyroid carcinomas contains predominantly K-type subunits, whereas pyruvate kinase differentiated medullary thyroid carcinomas consist M- K-type subunits equal proportion. order analyse incorporation phosphate respective isozymes endogenous phosphorylation cytosolic extracts [32P]ATP, homotetrameric isozymes well heterotetrameric hybrids differentiated tumors resolved affinity chromatography Blue-Sepharose CL-6B and, necessary, purified immunoprecipitation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis purified isozymes subsequent autoradiography showed incorporation phosphate K4-type isozymes, isozymes. phosphorylation appeared cAMP-independent occurred serine residue.
