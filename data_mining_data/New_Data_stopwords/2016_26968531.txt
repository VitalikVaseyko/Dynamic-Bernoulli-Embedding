 Neuronal activity high-energy demanding process recruiting neural cells adapt metabolism sustain energy redox balance neurons. neurotransmission, synaptic cleft glutamate activates receptors neurons astrocytes, taken astrocytes energy costly transporters. astrocytes, energy requirement glutamate influx likely met glycolysis. enable this, astrocytes constitutively glycolytic, robustly expressing 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3), enzyme negligibly present neurons continuous degradation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC)-Cdh1. Additional factors contributing glycolytic frame astrocytes may include 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), pyruvate kinase muscle isoform-2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4), lactate dehydrogenase-B, monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4). Neurotransmission-associated messengers, nitric oxide ammonium, stimulate lactate release astrocytes. Astrocyte-derived glycolytic lactate thus sustains energy needs neurons, contrast astrocytes mainly rely oxidative phosphorylation. Neuronal activity unavoidably triggers reactive oxygen species, antioxidant defense neurons weak; hence, use glucose oxidation pentose-phosphate pathway preserve redox status. Furthermore, neural activity coupled erythroid-derived erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) mediated transcriptional activation antioxidant genes astrocytes, boost de novo glutathione biosynthesis neighbor neurons. Thus, bioenergetics redox programs astrocytes adapted sustain neuronal activity survival. Developing therapeutic strategies interfere pathways may useful combat neurological diseases. current knowledge brain's management bioenergetics redox requirements associated neural activity herein revisited. astrocyte-neuronal lactate shuttle (ANLS) explains energy needs neurotransmission. Furthermore, neurotransmission unavoidably triggers increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species neurons. coupling glutamatergic activity transcriptional activation antioxidant genes, astrocytes provide neurons neuroprotective glutathione astrocyte-neuronal glutathione shuttle (ANGS). article part 60th Anniversary special issue.
