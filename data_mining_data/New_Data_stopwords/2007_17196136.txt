 OBJECTIVE: previous investigation demonstrated angiotensin II could induce proliferation differentiation hepatic stellate cells, also could up-regulate extracellular matrix synthesis. objective study determine effects 10(-5) mol/L angiotensin II gene expression hepatic stellate cells. METHODS: incubation 10(-5) mol/L angiotensin II 48 hours, cultured hepatic stellate cells collected. mRNA total protein obtained cell lysate suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), 2D-gel electrophoresis MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry used identify cDNAs proteins. RESULTS: total 36 clones subtracted cDNA library sequenced compared sequences GenBank using BLAST. 36 differentially expressed gene fragments subtracted library, 13 differentially expressed gene fragments showed significant homology known proteins, ribosomal protein, beta-actin FE-3, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, CD147, pyruvate kinase, peroxiredoxin 1, BAT3, 2 gene fragments encoding protein BC097361 BC057380 functions disclosed. 1110 1008 protein spots detected employing ImageMaster 2D Platinum 4.9 proteome image analysis system angiotensin-treated hepatic stellate cells control cells separately. Among spots 108 proteins up-regulated 153 proteins down-regulated. Several up-regulated proteins chosen excised in-gel digest MALDI-TOF-MS Database analysis showed among high expression proteins, prohibitin, RBL-NDP kinase 1.8x10(4) subunit, electron transfer flavoprotein alpha-subunit, guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 15, heat shock 7.0x10(4) protein 5. CONCLUSION: results suggest up-regulation hepatic stellate cell mRNA influences proliferation, differentiation apoptosis cells. proteins signal transduction, metabolizing regulation, apoptosis suppression, fibrogenesis regulation hepatic stellate cells up-regulated.
