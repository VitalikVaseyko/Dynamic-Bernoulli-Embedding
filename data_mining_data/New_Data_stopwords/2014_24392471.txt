 Epidemiological clinical studies established health benefits Mediterranean diet, important component olives olive oil derived olive tree (Olea Europea). well-established major fatty acid constituents, also minor phenolic components, olives olive oil important health benefits. Emerging research past decade highlighted beneficial effects range phenolic compounds olives olive oil, particularly cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome inflammatory conditions. Mechanisms action include potent antioxidant anti-inflammatory effects. Further, accumulating evidence indicates potential polyphenols potent antioxidants, hydroxytyrosol oleuropein oncology. Numerous studies, vitro vivo, demonstrated anticancer effects hydroxytyrosol include chemopreventive cell-specific cytotoxic apoptotic effects. Indeed, precise molecular mechanisms accounting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory anticancer properties becoming clear is, least part, due high through-put gene transcription profiling. Initially, constructed phylogenetic trees visualize evolutionary relationship members Oleaceae family secondly, plants producing hydroxytyrosol make inferences potential similarities differences medicinal properties identify novel plant candidates treatment prevention disease. Furthermore, given recent interest hydroxytyrosol potential anticancer agent chemopreventative utilized transcriptome analysis erythroleukemic cell line K562, investigate effects hydroxytyrosol three gene pathways: complement system, Warburg effect chromatin remodeling ascertain relevant gene candidates prevention cancer.
