 Two isoenzymes pyruvate kinase--PK-1 PK-2 obtained cortical layer rabbit kidney method chromatography DEAE-cellulose. Starvation rabbits 10--16 days alloxan diabetes produced significant changes specific activity PK soluble fraction obtained cortical layer rabbit kidney. However, significant shifts isoenzymatic spectrum PK kidneys rabbits alloxan diabetes: activity PK-1 increased considerably significantly, isoenzyme PK-2 disappeared almost completely.
