 Incidences leukopenia caused bacteremia increased significantly associated prolonged hospital stay increased cost. Immunoproteomic promising method identify pathogenicity factors different diseases. present study, used immunoproteomic analysis pathogenicity factors leukopenia caused Klebsiella Pneumonia bacteremia. Approximately 40 protein spots localized 4 7 pI range detected two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, 6 differentially expressed protein spots 10 170 kDa identified. Pathogenicity factors including S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, glutathione synthetase, UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, acetate kinase elongation factor tu (EF-Tu). validation pathogenicity factor, used western blotting show Klebsiella pneumonia higher (EF-Tu) expression accompanied leukopenia rather leukocytosis. Thus, report 6 pathogenicity factors leukopenia caused Klebsiella pneumonia bacteremia, including 5 housekeeping enzymes EF-Tu. suggest EF-Tu could potential pathogenicity factor leukopenia caused Klebsiella pneumonia.
