 obligatory role carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) mediating mitochondrial lipid transport well established, process attenuated malonyl-CoA (M-CoA). However, necessity reducing M-CoA concentrations promote lipid oxidation recently challenged, suggesting external regulation CPT-I. Since previous work hepatocytes suggests involvement intermediate filament fraction cytoskeleton regulating CPT-I, investigated skeletal muscle CPT-I sensitivity M-CoA inhibition could regulated intermediate filaments, whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could involved process. Chemical disruption (3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, IDPN) intermediate filaments alter mitochondrial respiration sensitivity numerous substrates (palmitoyl-CoA, ADP, palmitoyl carnitine pyruvate). contrast, IDPN reduced CPT-I sensitivity M-CoA inhibition permeabilized muscle fibers, identifying M-CoA kinetics specific target intermediate filament regulation. Importantly, exercise mimicked effect IDPN M-CoA sensitivity, suggesting intermediate filament disruption vivo physiologically important CPT-I regulation. ascertain potential mechanism, since AMPK activated exercise, AMPK beta1beta2-KO mice utilized attempt ablate observed exercise response. Unexpectedly, mice displayed drastic attenuation resting M-CoA sensitivity, exercise IDPN could alter M-CoA sensitivity. data suggest AMPK required regulation intermediate filament interaction CPT-I. Altogether, data highlight M-CoA sensitivity important regulating mitochondrial lipid transport. Moreover, M-CoA sensitivity appears regulated intermediate filament interaction CPT-I, process important metabolic homeostasis challenged.
