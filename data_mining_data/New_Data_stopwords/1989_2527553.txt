 separation red blood cells reticulocytes young old erythrocytes enables investigations fractions different contents reticulocytes. Activities hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase showed linear relationship reticulocyte counts. dependence enzyme activities age red blood cells exhibited strong decline reticulocyte young erythrocyte stage followed little loss activity, thus leading biphasic decay enzyme activities. linear regression analysis enzyme activities erythrocytes (AE) reticulocytes (AR) could evaluated. activity given enzyme reticulocyte exceeded erythrocyte; quotient AR/AE represents decline enzyme activity reticulocyte erythrocyte stage. value AR/AE 16.7 pyruvate kinase 9.4 hexokinase thus considerably higher enzymes investigated (glucose phosphate isomerase: 2.9, phosphofructokinase: 4.3, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 4.5). patients suffering erythrocyte enzymopathies, AR/AE pyruvate kinase 16.2 thus almost identical normal enzyme. Calibration curves enzyme activity plotted versus fraction reticulocytes enable determination normal activity given erythrocyte enzyme depending content reticulocytes red blood cell suspensions. Thus unambiguous diagnosis enzyme defects irrespective reticulocyte counts becomes possible.
