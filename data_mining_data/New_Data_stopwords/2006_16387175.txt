 BACKGROUND: Canine models bone marrow renal transplantation provided important preclinical data relevant developing novel therapeutic protocols hematopoietic solid organ transplantation human beings. Nonmyeloablative transplantation shown induce stable mixed hematopoietic chimerism normal dogs correct phenotype canine pyruvate kinase deficiency Glanzman's thrombasthenia. study, investigated potential inducing renal allograft tolerance using nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation strategy induces mixed chimerism DLA-identical dogs. METHODS: Reciprocal renal allografts performed 4 DLA-identical 4 DLA-haploidentical dogs nonmyeloablative conditioning (200 cGy total body irradiation [TBI]) transient immunosuppression cyclosporine (CSP) mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without simultaneous bone marrow transplantation. Two DLA-identical control dogs received reciprocal renal allografts without TBI immunosuppression CSP MMF. Serum creatinine (Cr) concentration monitored assess renal allograft function. RESULTS: renal allografts acutely rejected 2 DLA-identical dogs without TBI immunosuppression. long-term (>1 year) renal allograft survival evidenced normal (<2.0 mg/dL) serum Cr concentration DLA-identical DLA-haploidentical dogs underwent 200 cGy TBI transient immunosuppression CSP MMF either without simultaneous bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmyeloablative conditioning (200 cGy TBI) transient immunosuppression CSP MMF induce renal allograft tolerance DLA-identical DLA-haploidentical dogs without donor/host mixed hematopoietic chimerism. findings suggest may possible induce tolerance solid organ transplants without need chronic immunosuppressive therapy stable hematopoietic chimerism setting DLA-matched haploidentical transplants.
