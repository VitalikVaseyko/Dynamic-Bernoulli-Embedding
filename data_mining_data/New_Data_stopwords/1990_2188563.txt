 Liver disease, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis, associated number interesting chemical changes result structural metabolic abnormalities erythrocyte membrane leading microscopically observable cell shape changes hemolytic anemia varying mild potentially lethal. Increase unesterified serum cholesterol owing lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) deficiency cirrhosis leads expansion lipid bilayer macrocytosis without megaloblastic changes precursors. Substitutions phosphatidyl choline (PC) moieties erythrocyte lipid bilayer lead echinocytes (disaturated PC) stomatocytes (diunsaturated PC). patients, high density lipoprotein (HDL) abnormalities lead erythrocyte surface changes causing rapid formation echinocytes. rapidity reversibility changes suggest blockade metabolic transport channels critical maintenance erythrocyte membrane shape. Metabolic changes involving vitamin E deficiency leading lipid peroxidation pyruvate kinase instability leading adenosine triphosphate (ATP) reduction also invoked explain hemolysis associated acute liver damage. severe hemolysis liver disease associated acanthocytes (spur cells) marked imbalance cholesterol-phospholipid ratio. patients usually hypersplenism, well rigid erythrocyte membrane transformations irreversible. erythrocyte membrane shape changes described appear reversible liver disease abates, may become irreversible bits projecting membrane repeatedly removed macrophages enlarged spleen.
