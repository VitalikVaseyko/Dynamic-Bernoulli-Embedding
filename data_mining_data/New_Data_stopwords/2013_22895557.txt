 Colorectal cancer represents one challenging diseases. Increasing evidence indicates aberrant expression microRNAs (miRNAs) related pathogenesis colorectal cancer. Cancer cells reprogram metabolic pathways sustain higher proliferation rates. Whether mechanisms underlying role miRNA colorectal cancer involved metabolic reprogramming mechanisms miRNAs alter cancer metabolism yet unknown. Herein, show miR-124, miR-137 miR-340 associated poor prognosis colorectal cancer. Expression miRNAs inhibits growth colorectal cancer cells. PKM (pyruvate kinase isozyme) alternative splicing proteins (PTB1/hnRNAPA1/hnRNAPA2), control inclusion exon 9 (PKM1) exon 10 (PKM2), targeted miR-124, miR-137 miR-340. Consequently, miR-124, miR-137 miR-340 switch PKM gene expression PKM2 PKM1. High ratios PKM1/PKM2 inhibit glycolysis rate, elevate glucose flux oxidative phosphorylation. results demonstrate miRNAs (miR-124, miR-137 miR-340) impair colorectal cancer growth counteracting Warburg effect due regulating alternative splicing PKM gene.
