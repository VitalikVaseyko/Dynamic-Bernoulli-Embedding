 Bioinformatics research Plasmodium falciparum revealed two isoforms pyruvate kinase: type-I type-II enzymes. type-I enzyme shows typical glycolytic properties, type-II enzyme involved fatty acid type-II biosynthesis predicted localize apicoplast targeting signal N-terminus. type-I type-II isoforms evolutionary origin Toxoplasma gondii isozymes, TgPyKI TgPyKII, respectively; however, TgPyKII localizes mitochondrion apicoplast. Accordingly, made recombinant full length P. falciparum pyruvate kinase type-II protein using wheat germ cell-free expression system obtained specific antibody type-II protein. Fluorescent microscopic analysis revealed P. falciparum type-II enzyme localized apicoplast, mitochondrion. data suggest differences localization metabolic pathways P. falciparum T. gondii pyruvate kinase isoforms.
