 effects strenuous exercise serum electrolytes, blood metabolites, serum enzymes studied group 13 horses participating 50-mile endurance ride. Blood samples collected before, during, end ride, well 1 hour 16 hours completion ride. significant changes values preride values compared samples taken different sample-collection periods. Significant (P less 0.001) decreases observed serum concentrations chloride, potassium, calcium. significant increase serum concentration phosphorous also observed. mean concentrations chloride calcium remained significantly reduced 16-hour postride sample. small, significant (P less 0.05), increase sodium decrease glucose concentrations observed midride sample. Although midride samples reflect significant change blood pyruvate concentration, significant (P less 0.05) increase observed end ride. Changes hematocrit total protein concentration statistically significant levels P less 0.001 P less 0.01, respectively. horses showed highly significant increases concentrations free fatty acids, serum enzymes (P less 0.001), lactate (P less 0.005) ride. elevated values creatine kinase lactic dehydrogenase decreased, aspartate aminotransferase values remained increased long completion ride. lactate free fatty acids, rose significantly ride, decreased approximately preride values 16 hours ride completed. conclude changes serum electrolytes, enzymes, blood metabolites reflect sweating, muscle damage, increased dependency anaerobic glycolysis lipid mobilization horses experienced competitive endurance ride.
