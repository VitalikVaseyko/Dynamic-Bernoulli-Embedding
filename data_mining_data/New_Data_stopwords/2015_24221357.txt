 Skeletal muscle regulates substrate choice according demand availability pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) central regulation. Circulating interleukin (IL)-6 increases exercise IL-6 suggested increase whole body fat oxidation. Furthermore, IL-6 reported increase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation AMPK suggested regulate PDHa activity. Together, suggests IL-6 may involved regulating PDH. aim study investigate effect single injection IL-6 PDH regulation skeletal muscle fed fasted mice. Fed 16-18 h fasted mice injected either 3 ng . g(-1) recombinant mouse IL-6 PBS control. Fasting markedly reduced plasma glucose, muscle glycogen, muscle PDHa activity, well increased PDK4 mRNA protein content skeletal muscle. IL-6 injection affect plasma glucose muscle glycogen, increased AMPK ACC phosphorylation tended decrease p38 protein content skeletal muscle fasted mice. addition IL-6 injection reduced PDHa activity fed mice increased PDHa activity fasted mice without significant changes PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation PDP1 PDK4 mRNA protein content. present findings suggest IL-6 contributes regulating PDHa activity hence carbohydrate oxidation, metabolic state muscle seems determine outcome regulation. addition, AMPK p38 may contribute IL-6-mediated PDH regulation fasted state.
