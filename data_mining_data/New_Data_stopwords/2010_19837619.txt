 Malaria occurred Cabo Verde archipelago epidemic characteristics since colonization. Nowadays, occurs Santiago Island alone though prophylaxis recommended World Health Organization, studies highlight prospect malaria becoming serious public health problem result presence antimalarial drug resistance associated mutations parasite populations underscore need tighter surveillance. Despite presumptive weak immune status population, severe symptoms malaria observed many people present subclinical course disease. data prevalence sickle-cell trait red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (two classical genetic factors associated resistance severe malaria) available Cabo Verde archipelago and, therefore, studied low morbidity malaria relation particular genetic characteristics human host population. also included analysis pyruvate kinase deficiency associated gene, reported putatively associated resistance disease. Allelic frequencies polymorphisms examined closer European African populations malaria selection signatures found. association found analyzed human factors infection one result high interest: linkage disequilibrium test revealed association distant loci PKLR gene adjacent regions, non-infected individuals. could mean conserved gene region selected association protection infection and/or disease.
