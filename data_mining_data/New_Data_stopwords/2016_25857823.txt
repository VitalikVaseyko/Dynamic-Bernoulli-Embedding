 CONTEXT: Diabetes mellitus (DM) probably single important metabolic disease widely recognized one leading causes death disability. Cissus quadrangularis Linn. (Vitaceae) medicinal food reported possess hypoglycemic activity. OBJECTIVE: present study evaluates effect ethyl acetate fraction C. quadrangularis stem (CQSF) carbohydrate metabolism hepatic tissues experimental diabetic rats. phytochemical compounds present CQSF extract identified gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. MATERIALS METHODS: Diabetic animals treated CQSF (50, 100, 200 mg/kg body weight) 45 d. Several indices blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, liver function tests, hepatic glycogen content, activities carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes assayed 45 extract treatment. RESULTS: pronounced effect observed extract doses 100 200 mg/kg body weight. CQSF dose 100 mg/kg body weight significantly decreased altered levels blood glucose 56%. CQSF also modulated activities carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes significantly increasing activity hexokinase (1.9-fold) pyruvate kinase (2.2-fold) significantly reducing activity glucose-6-phosphatase (41.23%), fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (29.43%), glycogen phosphorylase (35.07%). GC-MS analysis revealed presence 10 chemical constituents, N-methyl-1-adamantane acetamide found prevailing compound extract. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: current study suggests antidiabetic potential CQSF, mediated regulation carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities.
