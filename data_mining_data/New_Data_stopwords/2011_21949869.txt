 response deregulated oncogene activation, mammalian cells activate disposal programs programmed cell death. investigate mechanisms behind oncogenic stress response used Bcr-Abl over-expressing cells cultivated presence imatinib. Imatinib deprivation led rapid induction Bcr-Abl activity over-stimulation PI3K/Akt-, Ras/MAPK-, JAK/STAT pathways. resulted delayed necrosis-like cell death starting 48 hours imatinib withdrawal. Cell death preceded enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, amino acid metabolism leading elevated ATP protein levels. enhanced metabolism could linked induction cell death inhibition glycolysis glutaminolysis sufficient sustain cell viability. Therefore, data provide first evidence metabolic changes induced Bcr-Abl hyper-activation important mediators oncogenic stress-induced cell death.During first 30 hours imatinib deprivation, Bcr-Abl hyper-activation affect proliferation resulted cellular swelling, vacuolization, induction eIF2alpha phosphorylation, CHOP expression, well alternative splicing XPB, indicating endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Cell death dependent p38 RIP1 signaling, whereas classical death effectors ER stress, namely CHOP-BIM antagonized concomitant up-regulation Bcl-xL.Screening 1,120 compounds potential effects oncogenic stress-induced cell death uncovered corticosteroids antagonize cell death upon Bcr-Abl hyper-activation normalizing cellular metabolism. protective effect demonstrated finding corticosteroids rendered lymphocytes permissive transforming activity Bcr-Abl. corticosteroids used together imatinib treatment Bcr-Abl positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia data could important implications design combination therapy protocols.In conclusion, excessive induction Warburg type metabolic alterations cause cell death. data indicate metabolic changes major mediators oncogenic stress induced Bcr-Abl.
