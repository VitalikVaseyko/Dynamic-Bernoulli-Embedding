 SCOPE: study addresses effects branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) global gene expression liver skeletal muscle molecular mechanisms underlying improvement liver cirrhosis using DNA microarray analysis combined RNase protection assay. METHODS RESULTS: Male Wistar rats administered carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4) ) repeatedly 19 weeks decompensated cirrhosis model thereafter given BCAA-enriched diet (AL) normal diet (LC) 5 weeks. control-diet rats without CCl(4) administration used normal control group. Gene expression AL reversed twofold greater LC microarray selected elucidate improvements nutritional metabolic disorders. Downregulation fatty acid translocase (FAT)/Cd36, glutamine synthetase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 believed promote lower uptake fatty acids, lower ammonia incorporation, higher uptake glucose, thus provide energy source without using BCAA. Ultimately, catabolism BCAA skeletal muscle protein would slowed, maintaining BCAA concentrations blood. CONCLUSION: established, first time, regulatory gene pathways processes involved hepatic fibrosis energy metabolism (hypoalbuminemia, hyperammonemia, carbohydrate catabolism, relationships) BCAA supplementation.
