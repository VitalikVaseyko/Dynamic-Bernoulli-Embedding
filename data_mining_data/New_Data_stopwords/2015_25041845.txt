 metabolic activity cancer cells primarily rely aerobic glycolysis. Besides glycolysis, tumor cells also exhibit excessive addition glutamine, constitutes advantage tumor growth. M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) plays pivotal role sustaining aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway serine synthesis pathway. However, participation PKM2 glutaminolysis little known. demonstrated PKM2 depletion could provoke glutamine metabolism enhancing beta-catenin signaling pathway consequently promoting downstream c-Myc-mediated glutamine metabolism colon cancer cells. Treatment 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), glycolytic inhibitor, got consistent results above. addition, dimeric form PKM2, lacks pyruvate kinase activities, plays critical role regulating beta-catenin. Moreover, found overexpression PKM2 negatively regulated beta-catenin miR-200a. insights supply evidence glutaminolysis plays compensatory role cell survival upon glucose metabolism impaired.
