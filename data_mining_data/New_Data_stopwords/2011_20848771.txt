 OBJECTIVE: prepare identify monoclonal antibody (mAb) pyruvate kinase N terminal (PK-N). METHODS: BALB/C mice immunized immunogen PK-N-GST-tag. spleen cells isolated fused SP2/0 cells. several rounds detecting cloning, hybridoma cell strains secreting anti-PK-N mAb obtained. specificity evaluated ELISA Western blot, titer, immunoglobulin subtype affinity mAb measured. RESULTS: Two cell strains hybridoma, 2B2E4G 2C6F5, obtained. hybridoma cell strains secreting anti-PK-N mAb belonged IgG2b subtype, mAb titer ascetic fluid 1 : 409600 1 : 102400, respectively. affinity reached 3.54 x 10(8) L/mol 2.72 x 10(8) L/mol, respectively, determined ELISA. Western blot demonstrated mAb could specifically recognize immunogen natural cell lysis protein. cell immunohistochemistry proved antibody could recognize human L type pyruvate kinase expressed plasma HL-7702 cell strain paraffin slice hepatoma. CONCLUSION: success anti-PK-N mAb preparation provides foundation studies glycolysis normal condition metabolic diseases.
