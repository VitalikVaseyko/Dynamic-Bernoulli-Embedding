 Several enzymes amino acid carbohydrate metabolism studied primary cultures fetal rat hepatocytes. One day plating, activity esterase gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase decreased half freshly isolated hepatocytes, remained constant. Acid phosphatase revealed lower activity plating recovered levels isolated cells day-8. Leucine aminopeptidase glutathione S-transferase showed peak activity respectively day-6 day-8. hand, activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase increased linearly Day-1, pyruvate kinase reached plateau Day-2. results suggest different patterns enzyme activities culture might reflection, release homeostatis adaptation new environment.
