 L Pyruvate kinase (LPK) considered major form liver. Two isozymes, LPK MPK, localized isolated rat hepatocyte vitro immunocytometric method. MPK induced insulin, also creates slight stimulation LPK (at physiological doses) fed fasted animals. Glucagon inhibits LPK fed animals (the fasting rat already situation gluconeogenesis hormone ineffective). MPK insensitive glucagon, regardless nutritional state animals. PK isozyme thus controlled predominantly one two hormones, corresponding sophisticated regulation hepatic glycolysis gluconeogenesis.
