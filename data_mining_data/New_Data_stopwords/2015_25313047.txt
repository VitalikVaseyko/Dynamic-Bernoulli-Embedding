 Symbiotic relationships neurons glia must adapt structures, functions, metabolic roles tissues in. show Muller glia retinas specific enzyme deficiencies enhance ability synthesize Gln. metabolic cost deficiencies impair Muller cell's ability metabolize Glc. show cells compensate deficiency using metabolites produced neurons. Muller glia deficient pyruvate kinase (PK) aspartate/glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), key component malate-aspartate shuttle. contrast, photoreceptor neurons express AGC1 M2 isoform pyruvate kinase, commonly associated aerobic glycolysis tumors, proliferating cells, cell types. findings reveal previously unidentified type metabolic relationship neurons glia. Muller glia compensate unique metabolic adaptations using lactate aspartate neurons surrogates missing PK AGC1.
