 true breeding strain made wild-caught mouse low erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.40) activity. variation showed additive inheritance segregated allele single locus (Pk-1b). Mice homozygous reduced blood pyruvate kinase activity cosegregated reduced liver activity. tissues variant enzyme lowered heat stability reduced Km values ADP. increased stimulation FDP also detected liver pyruvate kinase. difference isoelectric point variant enzyme either erythrocyte liver observed compared enzyme C57BL mice (Pk-1a/Pk-1a). concluded Pk-1 structural gene erythrocyte major liver pyruvate kinase. tissue pyruvate kinase showed altered characteristics.
