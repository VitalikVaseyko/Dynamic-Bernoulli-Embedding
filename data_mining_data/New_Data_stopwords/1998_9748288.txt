 transcription rates glycolytic enzyme genes coordinately induced cells exposed low oxygen tension. effect described many cell types restricted species phyla. mammalian cells, 11 distinct glycolytic enzymes, least 9 induced hypoxia. Recent reports described role hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) transcriptional activation lactate dehydrogenase A, aldolase-A, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase-1 genes. known whether HIF-1 factor acts exclusively regulate genes hypoxia, genes pathway regulated. paper, describe analyses muscle-specific pyruvate kinase-M beta-enolase promoters implicate additional mechanisms regulation glycolytic enzyme gene transcription hypoxia. Transient transcription reporter gene directed either promoter activated transfected muscle cells exposed hypoxia. Neither promoters contain HIF-1 binding sites. Instead, hypoxia response localized conserved GC-rich element positioned immediately upstream GATAA site proximal promoter regions genes. GC element essential basal hypoxia-induced expression bound transcription factors Sp1 Sp3. Hypoxia caused progressive depletion Sp3 determined DNA binding studies Western analyses, whereas Sp1 protein levels remained unchanged. Overexpression Sp3 repressed expression beta-enolase promoters. concluded hypoxia activates glycolytic enzyme gene promoters down-regulating Sp3, thereby removing associated transcriptional repression.
