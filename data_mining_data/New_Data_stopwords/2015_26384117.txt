 INTRODUCTION: inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) diarrhea caused exacerbation and/or infectious agents. Fecal calprotectin (FC) well-established biomarker intestinal inflammation IBD. However, usefulness depiction IBD exacerbation infectious diarrhea limited. value fecal pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type 2 (M2-PK) application remains unknown. AIM: compare performance M2-PK FC discriminating diarrhea caused IBD infectious agents. MATERIALS METHODS: One hundred three patients enrolled study, including 32 ulcerative colitis (UC), 21 Crohn's disease (CD), 29 acute diarrhea caused rotavirus (AD-RV), 21 acute diarrhea caused Salmonella enteritidis (AD-SE). M2-PK FC measured using ELISA. Areas receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities specificities tests distinguishing patient subgroups moderate severe UC CD AD-RV AD-SE calculated. RESULTS: Differences AUCs M2-PK FC distinguishing UC [CD] AD-RV -0.06 (p < 0.028) [-0.10 (p < 0.0018)] differentiating UC [CD] AD-SE 0.03 (NS) [-0.19(p < 0.0011)].M2-PK sensitivities specificities distinguishing UC [CD] AD-RV 75.0%[71.4%] 89.7% [89.7%] differentiation UC [CD] AD-SE 56.3% [71.4%] 95.2[57.1%]. CONCLUSIONS: performance M2-PK distinguishing children moderate-to-severe IBD patients infectious gastroenteritis inferior FC. Neither test sensitivity ands pecificity sufficient everyday clinical application.
