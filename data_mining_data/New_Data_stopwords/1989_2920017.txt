 effect protein-free diet decrease liver activity branched-chain (-2-oxoacid) dehydrogenase (BCD) complex (active form) increase BCD kinase activity unaffected preparation hepatocytes, partially reversed 25 h culture hepatocytes medium 199. Activation BCD complex preceded loss BCD kinase. effect culture BCD complex completely prevented omission branched-chain amino acids partially prevented 1 mM-alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate 0.2 mM-pyruvate/2 mM-lactate. Protein-free diet decreased plasma branched-chain amino oxo ('keto') acids increased plasma pyruvate lactate. concluded: (1) branched-chain amino acids involved directly regulation activities BCD complex BCD kinase; (2) mitochondrial uptake branched-chain oxo acids necessary regulation BCD complex activity; (3) stable increase BCD kinase may function hysteresis mechanism.
