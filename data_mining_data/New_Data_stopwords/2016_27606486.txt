 CD43 one abundant co-stimulatory molecules T-cell surface; transduces activation signals cytoplasmic domain, contributing modulation outcome T-cell responses. aim study uncover new signalling pathways regulated sialomucin. Analysis changes protein abundance allowed us identify pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), enzyme glycolytic pathway, element potentially participating signalling cascade resulting engagement CD43 T-cell receptor (TCR). found glycolytic activity enzyme significantly increased response TCR+CD43 co-stimulation, PKM2 tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting performing moonlight functions. report phosphorylation Y(105) PKM2 Y(705) signal transducer activator transcription 3 induced response TCR+CD43 co-stimulation, resulting activation mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (MEK5/ERK5) pathway. ERK5 cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activated, c-Myc nuclear factor-kappaB (p65) nuclear localization, well Bad phosphorylation, augmented. Consistent this, expression human CD43 murine T-cell hybridoma favoured cell survival. Altogether, data highlight novel signalling pathways CD43 molecule lymphocytes, underscore role CD43 promoting cell survival non-glycolytic functions metabolic enzymes.
