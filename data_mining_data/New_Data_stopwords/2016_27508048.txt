 MiR-338-3p down-regulated cancer, inhibits cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, increases chemosensitivity, functions ovarian cancer remains unknown. present study aims identify miR-338-3p targeted genes investigate associated regulatory mechanisms ovarian cancer cell proliferation metabolism. results demonstrated miR-338-3p expression down-regulated ovarian cancer tissues cell lines. Restoration miR-338-3p expression ovarian cancer cells could inhibit cell proliferation, lactate production lactate production ovarian cancer cells. PKM2 verified target gene miR-338-3p luciferase assay. study indicated miR-338-3p controlled ovarian cancer cell metabolism inhibiting PKM2 expression. summarized regulatory role miR-338-3p PKM2 expression ovarian cancer may play important roles cell metabolism.
