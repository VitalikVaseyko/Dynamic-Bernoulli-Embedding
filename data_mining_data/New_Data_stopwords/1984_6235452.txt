 Hexokinase (ATP: hexose 6-phosphotransferase, E.C.2.7.1.1) phosphofructokinase (ATP:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, E.C.2.7.1.11), two key regulatory enzymes glycolytic pathway vertebrate cells, isolated partially purified Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi epimastigotes. enzymes associated particles sedimentable 105 000 X gav 1 h high degree latency; solubilized sonication. Hexokinase catalyses phosphorylation series monosaccharides following relative rates: D-glucose (100) congruent D-fructose (97) greater 2-deoxy-D-glucose (72) congruent mannose (69) greater 2-amino-D-glucose (63) greater 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (21). little phosphorylating activity found D-galactose, N-acetyl-2-amino-D-glucose 1-alpha-methyl-D-glucose. D-Glucose phosphorylation fixed ATP concentration follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics Km = 40 microM Vmax = 440 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein. D-Mannose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose N-acetyl-2-amino-D-glucose act competitive inhibitors glucose phosphorylation, suggesting single kinase. Mg2+-ATP preferred phosphoryl donor, ITP GTP much less effective. T. cruzi hexokinase inhibited D-glucose 6-phosphate, following compounds (2 mM):D-fructose 6-phosphate, D-fructose 1,6-diphosphate, D-glucose 1,6-diphosphate, phosphoenol pyruvate, L-malate citrate. Phosphofructokinase displays simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics evidence sigmoidicity respect D-fructose 6-phosphate ATP concentrations tested, giving Km 1.31 mM Vmax = 400 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein optimal ATP levels. respect ATP, enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics low concentration (less 1 mM) substrate (Km = 40 microM 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). moderate inhibition observed high ATP levels (70% maximal activity 2 mM). GTP substitute ATP phosphoryl donor (Km = 79 microM conditions), produces small inhibitory effects high concentrations. 5'-AMP activates enzyme decreasing Km respect D-fructose 6-phosphate without affecting Vm. well-known regulators activity enzyme procaryote vertebrate systems citrate, phosphoenol pyruvate, ammonium phosphate ions effect T. cruzi.
