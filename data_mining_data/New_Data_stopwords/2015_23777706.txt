 Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) plays central role pathophysiology Alzheimer's disease (AD) induction oxidative stress. peptide produced proteolytic cleavage amyloid precursor protein (APP) action beta- gamma-secretases. Previous studies demonstrated reduction Abeta, using antisense oligonucleotide (AO) directed Abeta region APP, reduced oxidative stress-mediated damage prevented reverted cognitive deficits senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8), useful animal model investigating events related Abeta pathology possibly early phase AD. current study, aged SAMP8 treated AO directed PS-1, component gamma-secretase complex, tested learning memory T-maze foot shock avoidance novel object recognition. Brain tissue collected identify decrease oxidative stress evaluate proteins differently expressed oxidized reduction free radical levels induced Abeta. used expression proteomics redox proteomics approaches. brain AO-treated mice decrease oxidative stress markers found, proteins identified proteomics expressed differently nitrated involved processes known impaired AD. results suggest treatment AO directed PS-1 old SAMP8 mice reverses learning memory deficits reduces Abeta-mediated oxidative stress restoration normal condition identifies possible pharmacological targets combat devastating dementing disease.
