 weak acid sorbic acid transiently inhibited growth Saccharomyces cerevisiae media low pH. lag period, length depended severity weak-acid stress, yeast cells appeared adapt stress, eventually recovering growing normally. adaptation weak-acid stress due metabolism removal sorbic acid. pma1-205 mutant, half normal membrane H+-ATPase activity, shown sensitive sorbic acid parent. Sorbic acid appeared stimulate plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity PMA1 pma1-205. Consistent this, cellular ATP levels showed drastic reductions, extent depended severity weak-acid stress. weak acid appear affect synthesis ATP CO2 production O2 consumption affected significantly PMA1 pma1-205 cells. However, glycolytic mutant, one-third normal pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase activity hence reduced capacity generate ATP, sensitive sorbic acid isogenic parent. data consistent idea adaptation yeast cells sorbic acid dependent (i) restoration internal pH via export protons membrane H+-ATPase energy-demanding process (ii) generation sufficient ATP drive process still allow growth.
