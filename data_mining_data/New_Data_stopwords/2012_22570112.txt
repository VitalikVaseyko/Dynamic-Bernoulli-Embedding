 Salvador promotes cell cycle exit apoptosis modulation cyclin E Drosophila inhibitor apoptosis protein Drosophila. However, cellular function human Salvador (hSav1) rarely reported. screen novel binding proteins interact hSav1, cDNA hSav1 cloned bait protein plasmid, positive clones screened human fetal liver cDNA library yeast two-hybrid system. hSav1 mRNA expressed yeast self-activation toxicity yeast strain AH109. Twenty proteins found interact hSav1, including HS1 (haematopoietic cell specific protein1)-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1); neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9, pyruvate kinase, liver RBC, cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb, enoyl coenzyme hydratase short chain 1, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex, demonstrating yeast two-hybrid system efficient method investigating protein interactions. Among identified proteins, many mitochondrial proteins, indicating hSav1 may play role mitochondrial function. also confirmed interaction HAX-1 hSav1 mammalian cells. investigation provides functional clues exploration potential apoptosis-related proteins disease biotherapy.
