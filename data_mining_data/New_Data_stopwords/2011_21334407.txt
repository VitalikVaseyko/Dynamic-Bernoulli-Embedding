 BACKGROUND & AIMS: study investigated relationship tumor proliferative activity grade tumor glucose metabolism angiogenesis hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: study performed retrospective analysis 63 patients HCC underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) preoperative examination prior liver resection. Tumor proliferative activity evaluated Ki-67 labeling index (LI). grade tumor glucose metabolism evaluated measuring protein expression level glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, expression level pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) mRNA, FDG uptake. grade tumor angiogenesis evaluated protein expression level vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tumor microvessel density. RESULTS: patients divided tertiles according Ki-67 LI: low LI group (n = 21), intermediate LI group (n = 21), high LI group (n = 21). high LI group showed tendency advanced tumor stage, lower disease-free survival overall survival rates low LI intermediate LI groups. expression grade GLUT-1, PKM2 mRNA, FDG uptake gradually increased Ki-67 LI. hand, protein expression grade VEGF microvessel density paradoxically decreased Ki-67 LI. CONCLUSIONS: data suggest (1) proliferative activity resected specimen predicted prognosis patients HCC; (2) proliferative activity closely correlated glucose metabolism, angiogenesis.
