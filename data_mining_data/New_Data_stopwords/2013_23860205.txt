 OBJECTIVES: Phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK) plays central role cellular metabolic sensing energy balance homeostasis, interacts various pathways [e.g., TP53, mTOR, NUAK2 (sucrose nonfermenting-like kinase), MAPK3/1 (ERK) PDK]. Therefore, present study analyzed expression pAMPK, NUAK2, MAPK3/1 PDK-1 effect survival patients resected gastric cancer. METHODS: total 621 patients gastric adenocarcinoma surgically resected curative intent enrolled study. Immunohistochemical staining pAMPK, NUAK2, MAPK3/1 PDK-1 performed using tissue microarrays surgical specimens gastric cancer tissue. RESULTS: Positive pAMPK, NUAK2, MAPK3/1 PDK-1 expression observed 379 (61.0%), 257 (41.4%), 327 (52.7%) 67 (10.8%) cases, respectively. Multivariate survival analysis showed significantly better survival patients positive pAMPK MAPK3/1 expression patients negative expression [pAMPK: disease-free survival (DFS), hazard ratio (HR) = 0.750, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.568-0.970, p = 0.030; MAPK3/1: DFS, HR = 0.692, 95% CI = 0.720-0.974, p = 0.021), NUAK2 PDK-1 expression effect survival. CONCLUSION: pAMPK MAPK3/1 expression found independent prognostic marker patients resected gastric cancer.
