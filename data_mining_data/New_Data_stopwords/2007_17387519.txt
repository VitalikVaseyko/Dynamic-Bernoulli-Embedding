 work, fundamental regulatory role formate thuringiensin production resting cell Bacillus thuringiensis YBT-032 investigated. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) production formate dehydrogenase activity increased formate addition 0.5 2.0 g/L, respectively. However, formate addition 1.5 g/L, activities pyruvate kinase glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reached peak increased 316 150% relative control, respectively. addition, intracellular production pyruvate, aspartate, citrate adenine significantly enhanced 75, 66, 32 78% well. improvement (90%) thuringiensin production also successfully obtained. Interestingly point out, thuringiensin yield closely correlative adenine production, linear relationship also observed. results suggest appropriate formate addition act modulator facilitate carbon flux glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway synthesize adenine thuringiensin via intracellular NADH availability.
