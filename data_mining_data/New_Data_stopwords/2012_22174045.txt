 report results phosphoproteomic analysis mouse thymoma cells treated tributyltin oxide (TBTO), immunotoxic compound. cell lysis, phosphoproteins isolated using Phosphoprotein Purification Kit, separated SDS-PAGE subsequently digested trypsin. Phosphopeptides enriched employing titanium dioxide, obtained fractions analyzed nano-LC-MS/MS. total 160 phosphoproteins 328 phosphorylation sites identified thymoma cells. Among differentially phosphorylated proteins identified TBTO-treated cells key enzymes, catalyze rate-limiting steps pathways sensitive cellular energy status. proteins included acetyl-CoA carboxylase isoform 1, catalyzes rate-limiting step fatty acid synthesis. Another enzyme glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, GFAT1, first rate-limiting enzyme hexoamine synthesis pathway. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), multicomplex enzyme catalyzes rate-limiting step aerobic oxidation fuel carbohydrates, identified TBTO-treated control cells; however, phosphorylation residue S293, known inhibit PDH activity, identified control cells. lower expression level ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, downstream kinase mammalian target rapamycin signaling pathway implicated protein synthesis phosphorylation 40 ribosomal S6, observed treated cells. Giant kinases like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAR1A), known mediate phosphorylation enzymes, identified TBTO-treated cells. Downregulation proteins, MAPK, matrin-3 ribonucleotide reductase, subunit RRM2, implicated cell proliferation, also observed TBTO-treated cells. Together, results show TBTO affects proliferation energy sensor pathways.
