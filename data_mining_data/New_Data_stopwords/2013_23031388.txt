 effect feed restriction gene expression regulatory enzymes intermediary metabolism studied two sheep breeds (Australian Merino Dorper) subjected two nutritional treatments: feed restriction (85% daily maintenance requirements) control (ad libitum feeding), 42 days. experimental animals (ram lambs) divided four groups, n = 5 (Australian Merino control (MC), Australian Merino Restriction (MR), Dorper control (DC) Dorper Restriction (DR)). trial, animals sacrificed samples taken liver tissue quantify glucose levels gene expression relevant intermediary metabolism enzymes (phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen synthase (GS), fatty acid synthase (FAS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPS)) real-time PCR. experimental period, MR animals lost 12.6% BW compared 5.3% lost Dorper lambs. MC DC rams gained, respectively, 8.8% 14% period. Within Dorper breed, restricted feed animals revealed significant decrease controls transcription PFK (1.95-fold) PK (2.26-fold), glycolytic enzymes. gluconeogenesis showed change feed restricted animals breeds. DR feed group presented significant decrease homologous Merino sheep group GS. experimental breeds, FAS mRNA expression decreased restricted feed groups. GDH expression decreased DR animals (1.84-fold) indicating reduced catabolism amino acids animals. Finally, CPS significantly (P < 0.05) higher Dorper sheep, indicating facilitated urea synthesis breed. results indicate better adaptation metabolic intermediate regulatory enzymes hepatic glucose production Dorper sheep feed restriction concurring BW results experimental groups.
