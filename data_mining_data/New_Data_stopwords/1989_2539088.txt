 activities pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase PDH kinase activator protein (KAP) increased 2-2.4-fold 25 h culture hepatocytes fed rats glucagon plus n-octanoate. PDH kinase activity hepatocytes starved rats (initially 2.2 x fed control) fell 25 h culture medium 199 (to 1.5 x fed control), maintained glucagon plus octanoate. Dibutyryl 8-bromo cyclic AMP increased PDH kinase activity 2-2.2-fold hepatocytes fed rats, phenylephrine isoproterenol (isoprenaline) without effect. Insulin blocked action glucagon increase PDH kinase activity decreased effect octanoate octanoate plus glucagon. suggested effects starvation increase activities PDH kinase KAP liver mediated alterations circulating concentrations glucagon, fatty acids insulin hepatic cyclic AMP.
