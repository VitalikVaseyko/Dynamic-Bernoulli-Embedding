 present study mechanism action M2-type pyruvate kinase human meningioma simultaneous presence fructose 1,6 diphosphate L-alanine investigated. Purified pyruvate kinase human meningioma allosterically inhibited L-alanine respect substrates phosphoenolpyruvate ADP. inhibitory effects L-alanine partially removed fructose 1,6 diphosphate. purified enzyme slightly susceptible ATP inhibition.
