 delta antigen (HDAg) protein encoded hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA genome. HDAg contains RNA binding domain, dimerization domain, nuclear localization signal (NLS). nuclear import HDV RNPs thought one first tasks HDAg HDV replication cycle. Using c-myc-PK fusions several regions HDAg transfection assays Huh7 cells, found HDAg NLS consists single stretch 10 amino acids, EGAPPAKRAR, located positions 66-75. Deletion mutation analysis region showed acidic glutamic acid residue position 66 basic arginine residue position 75 essential promoting nuclear import.
