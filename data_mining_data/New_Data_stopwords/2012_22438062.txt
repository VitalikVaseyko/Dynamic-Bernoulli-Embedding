 Iron (Fe) essential mineral nutrient plants, often available sufficient quantities sustain optimal growth. gain insights adaptive processes low Fe availability posttranslational level, conducted quantitative analysis Fe deficiency-induced changes phosphoproteome profile Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Isobaric tags relative absolute quantitation-labeled phosphopeptides analyzed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LTQ-Orbitrap collision-induced dissociation high-energy collision dissociation capabilities. Using combination titanium dioxide immobilized metal affinity chromatography enrich phosphopeptides, extracted 849 uniquely identified phosphopeptides corresponding 425 proteins identified several previously described phosphorylation motifs. subset 45 phosphoproteins defined significantly changed abundance upon Fe deficiency. Kinase motifs Fe-responsive proteins matched protein kinase A/calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase II, casein kinase II, proline-directed kinase, indicating possible critical function kinase classes Fe homeostasis. validate analysis, conducted site-directed mutagenesis IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT4 (IAR4), protein putatively functioning auxin homeostasis. iar4 mutants showed compromised root hair formation developed shorter primary roots. Changing serine-296 IAR4 alanine resulted phenotype intermediate mutant wild type, whereas acidic substitution aspartate mimic phosphorylation either lethal caused extreme dwarf phenotype, supporting critical importance residue Fe homeostasis. analyses disclose substantial changes abundance phosphoproteins involved primary carbohydrate metabolism upon Fe deficiency, complementing picture derived previous proteomic transcriptomic profiling studies.
