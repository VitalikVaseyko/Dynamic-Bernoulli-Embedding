 Peroxisome proliferators, function peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonists, induce peroxisomal, microsomal, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes, conjunction peroxisome proliferation, liver cells. Sustained activation PPARalpha leads development liver tumors rats mice. assertion synthetic PPARalpha ligands pose negligible carcinogenic risk humans attributable, part, failure observe peroxisome proliferation human hepatocytes. explore mechanism(s) species-specific differences response PPARalpha ligands, determined functional competency human PPARalpha vivo compared potency mouse PPARalpha. Recombinant adenovirus expresses human mouse PPARalpha produced administered intravenously PPARalpha-deficient mice. Human well mouse PPARalpha fully restored development peroxisome proliferator-induced immediate pleiotropic responses, including peroxisome proliferation enhanced expression genes involved lipid metabolism well nonperoxisomal genes, CD36, Ly-6D, Rbp7, monoglyceride lipase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4, C3f, identified recently up-regulated livers peroxisome proliferation. studies establish human PPARalpha functionally competent equally dose-sensitive mouse PPARalpha inducing peroxisome proliferation within context mouse liver environment heterodimerize mouse retinoid X receptor, human PPARalpha-mouse retinoid X receptor chimeric heterodimer transcriptionally activates mouse PPARalpha target genes manner qualitatively similar mouse PPARalpha.
