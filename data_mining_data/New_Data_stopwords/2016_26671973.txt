 OBJECTIVE: Androgen excess women frequently associated muscle insulin resistance, especially obese women polycystic ovary syndrome. However, whether primary event result indirect mechanisms currently debated. DESIGN: observational study. METHODS: obtained skeletal muscle biopsies bariatric surgery severely obese men (n=6) women (n=5) without (n=5) androgen excess. used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry identify muscle proteins showing differences abundance groups obese subjects. RESULTS: Women hyperandrogenism presented lowest abundances glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, beta-enolase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase M-type, desmin, whereas abundances molecules similar control women men. CONCLUSION: According nontargeted proteomic approach, women hyperandrogenism show specific alteration skeletal muscle proteome could contribute insulin resistance. men show similar results, alteration appear direct effect muscle androgen excess, rather consequence indirect mechanisms merit studies.
