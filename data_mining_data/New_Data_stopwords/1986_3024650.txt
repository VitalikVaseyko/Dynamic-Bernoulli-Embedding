 Nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDK) human platelets purified chromatography Blue Sepharose CL-6B gel (purification factor 950) shown free adenylate kinase, ATPase adenylate cyclase. molecular weight 70,000 subunits 17,000. pH optimum 8.0 Km values ATP dTDP determined two ways using pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase coupled enzyme assay. Values 0.38 0.20 mM obtained ATP 0.29 0.21 mM dTDP. Km values ADP (0.024 mM) GTP (0.12 mM) determined hexokinase-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled enzyme assay. values agreement reported NDK sources. Theophylline, inhibits NDK activity intact platelets platelet membrane preparations inhibits ADP-induced shape change platelets, shown competitive inhibitor free phosphorylated forms NDK competitive inhibition constants (Kic) 9.3 9.6 mM respectively. Papaverine, another cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, also inhibits ADP-induced shape change platelets, inhibitory effect platelet NDK. concluded inhibitory effect theophylline activity purified enzyme due structural similarity methylxanthine adenine moiety ADP.
