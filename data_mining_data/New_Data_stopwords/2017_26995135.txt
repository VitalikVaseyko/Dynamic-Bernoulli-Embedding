 Algal carcass low-value byproduct algae conversion biodiesel. Dried algal carcass rich protein, carbohydrate, multiple amino acids, typically well suited growth acid production lactic acid bacteria. study, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 used ferment different algal carcass media (ACM), including 2% ACM, 2% ACM 1.9% glucose (ACM-G), 2% ACM 1.9% glucose 2g/L amino acid mixture (ACM-GA). Concentrations organic acids (lactic acid acetic acid), acetyl-CoA, ATP analyzed HPLC, activities lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), acetokinase (ACK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) determined using chemical approach. growth L. bulgaricus cells ACM-GA close control medium (de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe). Lactic acid acetic acid contents greatly reduced L. bulgaricus cells grown ACM compared control medium. Acetyl-CoA content varied organic acid content increased cells grown different ACM compared control medium. ATP content L. bulgaricus cells ACM reduced compared cells grown control medium. Activities PFK ACK L. bulgaricus cells grown ACM higher PK LDH lower compared control. Thus, ACM rich nutrients may serve excellent substrate growth lactic acid bacteria, addition appropriate amounts glucose amino acids improve growth acid production.
