 Studies respiration glucose procyclic Trypanosoma congolense presence rotenone, antimycin, cyanide, salicylhydroxamic acid malonate indicated presence NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1, cytochrome aa3, trypanosome alternate oxidase NADH fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase pathway contributes electrons coenzyme Q respiratory chain. rotenone sensitive NADH dehydrogenase, trypanosome alternate oxidase, cytochrome aa3 accounted 24.5 +/- 6.5, 36.2 +/- 4.2 54.1 +/- 5.5% respectively total respiration. Activities lactate dehydrogenase, NAD(+)-linked malic enzyme pyruvate kinase less 6 nanomoles/min/mg protein suggesting play minor role energy metabolism parasite. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, NADP(+)-linked malic enzyme, NADH fumarate reductase, malate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase glycerol kinase hand specific activities greater 60 nanomoles/min/mg protein. enzyme activities could account production pyruvate, acetate, succinate glycerol. results show amount glycerol produced 35-48% combined total pyruvate, acetate succinate produced. apparent glycerol 3-phosphate produced glycolysis presence salicylhydroxamic acid dephosphorylated form glycerol rest oxidised via cytochrome aa3 form acetate, succinate pyruvate.
