 Cerebral ischemia causes functional alteration blood-brain barrier, formed brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). Changes protein expression activity selected differentially expressed enzymes investigated BCEC subjected hypoxia (24 h) alone followed 24-h reoxygenation. BCEC proteins isolated, separated 2-DE, identified MALDI-MS. Computer-based 2-D gel analysis identified 21 up-regulated proteins 4 down-regulated proteins hypoxia alone 9 proteins up-regulated posthypoxic reoxygenation. expression majority hypoxia-induced proteins reduced toward control levels reoxygenation. prominent changes identified glycolytic enzymes (e.g., phosphoglycerate kinase), proteins ER (e.g., calreticulin), cytoskeletal (e.g., vimentin) proteins. results indicate BCEC respond hypoxia/reoxygenation adaptive up-regulation proteins involved glycolysis, protein synthesis, stress response.
