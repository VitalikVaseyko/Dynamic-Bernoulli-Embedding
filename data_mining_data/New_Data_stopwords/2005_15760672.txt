 Catecholamines regulate glucose metabolism affect hepatic glucose production mainly beta2-adrenergic receptors. hypothesis tested gene expression numbers hepatic beta-adrenergic receptors calves influenced age. Examined developmental stages included pre-term (P0) full-term (F0) calves immediately birth, full-term calves day 5 life (F5), veal calves (VC) age 159 days. Expression beta1-, beta2-, beta3-adrenergic receptor mRNA measured real-time PCR. Receptor binding quantified saturation binding assays using (3H)-CGP-12177 ligand. Abundance mRNA differed among beta-adrenergic subtypes (beta2 > beta1 > beta3; P < 0.01). Beta3-adrenergic receptor mRNA undetectable VC. mRNA abundance beta2-adrenergic receptors higher (P < 0.05) VC P0 beta3-adrenergic receptors higher (P < 0.001) F5 P0. Binding studies revealed binding (3H)-CGP-12177 beta2-adrenergic receptors, highest VC (P < 0.001) higher (P < 0.05) F5 P0. Binding sites correlated positively mRNA levels beta2-adrenergic receptors (r = 0.67; P < 0.001), hepatic activities phosphoenolpyruvate kinase (r = 0.73; P < 0.001) pyruvate kinase (r = 0.4; P < 0.05), plasma glucose concentrations (r = 0.5; P < 0.01). conclusion, mRNA three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes found liver, beta2-adrenergic receptors dominant subtype. Numbers beta2-adrenergic receptors increased age mainly regulated transcriptional level. Numbers beta-adrenergic receptors positively associated hepatic activities gluconeogenetic enzymes plasma glucose levels, suggesting functional importance.
