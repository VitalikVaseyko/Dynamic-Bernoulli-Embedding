 Parenchymal cells adult rat liver, isolated collagenase perfusion technique, maintained primary culture detailed study carbohydrate metabolism carried initial 48-hour culture period. glucose concentration medium exerts major influence glycogen accumulation cells. Insulin, particularly high glucose concentrations, stimulates glycogen biosynthesis, whereas glucagon prevents glycogen accumulation. Dexamethasone without effect glycogen metabolism. Glucose appears stimulate glycogen accumulation activation glycogen synthetase enzyme. However, gradual loss synthetase activity throughout culture period. Similar decreases activity noted pyruvate kinase, aldolase hexokinase. Glucose, insulin dexamethasone unable prevent decreases enzyme activity. Foetal bovine serum contains fructose hexose appears factor serum responsible activation glycogen accumulation presence physiological glucose concentrations. lactic acid content serum may also stimulate glycogen accumulation. general, gradual loss pattern carbohydrate metabolism typical differentiated hepatocytes culture period.
