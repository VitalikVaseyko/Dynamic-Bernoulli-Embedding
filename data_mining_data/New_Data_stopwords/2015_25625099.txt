 BACKGROUND: Low molecular weight aldehydes carbonyl compounds derived glucose metabolism prevalent diabetic plasma. compounds react amino groups Lys Arg lead formation advanced glycation end products (AGEs). modification changes function proteins. present study aimed survey effect diabetes rat liver pyruvate kinase activity show inhibitory effect aminoguanidine (AG). MATERIALS METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 18, 6 8 weeks old) divided randomly three groups: first group control; second third groups induced diabetes using streptozocin. Third group received AG orally 8 weeks diabetes induction. Liver cell homogenate prepared studied groups L-type pyruvate kinase separated homogenate. Pyruvate kinase activity determined liver cell homogenate extracted L-type PK. PK activity compared samples groups. RESULTS: PK activity isolated form liver cell homogenate lower diabetic rats compared control group. AG-treated group showed higher PK activity compared untreated diabetic group; however, difference significant. Non-significant difference PK activity AG-treated diabetic non-diabetic (control) group indicated inhibitory effect AG glycation PK. CONCLUSION: obtained results showed PK activity decreased diabetic rats AG partially prevent reduction PK activity.
