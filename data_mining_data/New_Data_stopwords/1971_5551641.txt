 Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) Azotobacter vinelandii responds sharply adenylate energy charge, decrease activity high values charge, expected enzyme adenosine triphosphate-regenerating sequence. Glycolytic intermediates, especially glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, strongly stimulate reaction overcome inhibition caused high values energy charge. Thus, properties enzyme depend interaction energy charge concentrations hexose phosphates. properties pyruvate kinase, together phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, aspartokinase, citrate synthase, seem adapted provide appropriate partitioning phosphoenolpyruvate competing pathways response metabolic need.
