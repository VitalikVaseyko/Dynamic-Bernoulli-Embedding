 last decade witnessed reawakening cancer metabolism therapeutic target. particular, inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) holds remarkable promise. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), currently undergoing clinical trials, unique PDK inhibitor binds allosteric pyruvate site enzyme. However, safety DCA drug compromised neurotoxicity, whereas usefulness investigative tool limited high concentrations required exert observable effects cell culture. Herein, report identification - making use saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy, enzymatic assays computational methods - furoate thenoate derivatives allosteric pyruvate-site-binding PDK2 inhibitors. work substantiates pyruvate regulatory pocket druggable target.
