 perivenous periportal zones liver acinus differ enzyme complements capacities gluconeogenesis, glycolysis metabolic processes. biochemical factors governing metabolic zonation still poorly understood. Glucagon-mediated protein phosphorylation important factor regulation hepatic metabolism. show, comparing 32P-labelling pattern isolated periportal perivenous hepatocytes, glucagon promotes phosphorylation zone-specific peptides well three common peptides (glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen synthase pyruvate kinase) two cell types. propose zone-specific phosphorylation peptides important factor governing shortterm zonation metabolic processes liver.
