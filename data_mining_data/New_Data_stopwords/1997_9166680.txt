 part ongoing search susceptibility loci NIDDM, tested 19 genes whose products implicated insulin secretion action linkage NIDDM. Loci included G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels expressed beta-cells (KCNJ3 KCNJ7), glucagon (GCG), glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR), glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP1R), LIM/homeodomain islet-1 (ISL1), caudal-type homeodomain 3 (CDX3), proprotein convertase 2 (PCSK2), cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR), hexokinase 1 (HK1), hexokinase 2 (HK2), mitochondrial FAD-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD2), liver muscle forms pyruvate kinase (PKL, PKM), fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), hepatic phosphofructokinase (PFKL), protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1 beta (PPP1CB), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Additionally, tested histidine-rich calcium locus (HRC) chromosome 19q. regions tested linkage microsatellite markers 751 individuals 172 families least two patients overt NIDDM (according World Health Organization criteria) sibship, using nonparametric methods. 172 families comprise 352 possible affected sib pairs overt NIDDM 621 possible affected sib pairs defined fasting plasma glucose value >6.1 mmol/l glucose value >7.8 mmol/l 2 h oral glucose load. evidence linkage found 19 candidate genes NIDDM population nonparametric methods, suggesting genes major contributors pathogenesis NIDDM. However, evidence suggestive linkage found severe form NIDDM, defined overt NIDDM diagnosed 45 years age, CCKBR locus (11p15.4; P = 0.004). Analyses six additional markers spanning 27 cM chromosome 11p confirmed suggestive linkage region. Whether NIDDM susceptibility gene lies chromosome 11p population must determined analyses.
