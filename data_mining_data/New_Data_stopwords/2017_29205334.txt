 Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is) comprise new class antidiabetic agents inhibit glucose reabsorption renal proximal tubules. Although recent report demonstrated potential ability SGLT2-Is attenuate cancer growth SGLT2-expressing cancer cells, little known effects SGLT2-Is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, investigate anti-cancer properties SGLT2-I, canagliflozin, human liver cancer cells. SGTL2 mRNA protein expression detected Huh7 HepG2 cells, although HLE well primary human hepatocytes hepatic stellate cells. Canagliflozin exerted antiproliferative effects SGLT2-expressing Huh7 HepG2 cells dose-dependent manner inhibiting glycolytic metabolism including glucose uptake, lactate intracellular ATP production. agent also induced G2/M arrest apoptosis inhibited phosphorylation ERK, p38 AKT cleavage caspase3. Xenograft tumor growth assay showed oral administration canagliflozin (10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced subcutaneous tumor burdens glycemic status-independent manner, attenuated intratumor vascularization Huh7- HepG2-derived xenograft tumors BALB/c nude mice. vitro, canagliflozin suppressed increased human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation tubular formation observed Huh7 HepG2 co-cultures. contrast, canagliflozin effect tumor growth intratumor angiogenesis SGLT2-null HLE-derived xenograft models. results indicate SGLT2-I therapy potential new strategy treatment HCC.
