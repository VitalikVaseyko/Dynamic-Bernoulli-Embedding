 proliferating cells, transition aerobic anaerobic metabolism known Warburg effect, whose reversal inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Studying regulator pyruvate kinase (PYK) yeast, discovered central metabolism self-adapting synchronize redox metabolism respiration activated. Low PYK activity activated yeast respiration. However, levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, cells gained resistance oxidants. adaptation attributable accumulation PYK substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). PEP acted feedback inhibitor glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). TPI inhibition stimulated pentose phosphate pathway, increased antioxidative metabolism, prevented ROS accumulation. Thus, metabolic feedback loop, initiated PYK, mediated substrate acting TPI, stimulates redox metabolism respiring cells. Originating single catalytic step, autonomous reconfiguration central carbon metabolism prevents oxidative stress upon shifts fermentation respiration.
