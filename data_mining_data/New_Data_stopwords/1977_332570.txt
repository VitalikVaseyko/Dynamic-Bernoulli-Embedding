 content phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) measured isolated rat islets Langerhans incubated vitro. Islet PEP higher islets incubated 16.7 mmol/1 glucose islets incubated zero 2.8 mmol/1 glucose. Islet PEP content also increased islet incubated 5 mmol/1 D-glyceraldehyde. Mannoheptulose abolished glucose-induced rise PEP content elicited D-glyceraldehyde. results consistent role PEP intracellular mediator glucose- glyceraldehyde-induced insulin release. kinetics pyruvate kinase extracts rat islets studied. maximal extractable activity considerably higher known rates glycolytic flux. Km values found 0.16 mmol/1 PEP 0.5 mmol/1 ADP. control islet PEP content possible role PEP insulin release discussed.
