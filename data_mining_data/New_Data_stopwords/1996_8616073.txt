 survey PK-deficient patients molecular biology techniques performed France 26 unrelated families, least one mutation characterized. patients, European North African origin, exhibited approximatively 10% PK activity. Among PK-R mutants described, mutation G1529-->A (Arg-509-->Gln) frequent. strategy followed description PK mutants France firstly involves determination mutation PCR amplification restriction enzyme digestion and, secondly, sequencing gene negative samples. Study mutation residue 509 26 unrelated families indicated 10/52 defective alleles possessed mutation. study described seven different mutations; five yet documented. Two frameshift mutations found: deletion one G base repetition four Gs position 1231-1234 (PK Mondor), del C-1527 (PK Rouen), three missense mutations: G382-->C (Ala-114-->Pro) (PK Val-de-Marne), C398-->T (Ser-119-->Phe) (PK Beaujon), A1217-->G (Asn-392-->Ser) (PK Paris). Two mutations detected reported previously: C760-->T (Glu-240-->End) G1529-->A (Arg-509-->Gln.
