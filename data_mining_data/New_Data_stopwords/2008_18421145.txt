 considerable interest recently known ;fragment-based lead discovery'. novel feature approach begin small low-affinity compounds. main advantage larger potential chemical diversity sampled fewer compounds, particularly important new target classes. approach relies careful design fragment library, method detect binding fragment protein target, determination structure fragment bound target, conventional use structural information guide compound optimization. article methods reviewed, experiences fragment-based discovery lead series compounds kinases PDK1 ATPases Hsp90 discussed. examples illustrate key benefits issues approach also provide anecdotal examples patterns seen selectivity binding mode fragments across different protein targets.
