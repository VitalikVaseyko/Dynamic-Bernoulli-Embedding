 Changes activities pyruvate kinase, tyrosine aminotransferase adenylate cyclase well number alpha-1-adrenergic receptors hepatocytes maintained primary culture investigated. culture presence insulin dexamethasone activity tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) increased. increase suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). basic activity adenylate cyclase increased; however, weaker stimulation enzyme glucagon found. loss stimulation pyruvate kinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphate may result phosphorylation enzyme. number alpha-1-adrenergic receptors decreased culture, event influenced TPA.
