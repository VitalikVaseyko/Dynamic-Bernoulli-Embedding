 Warburg effect, reflects cancer cells' preference aerobic glycolysis glucose oxidation, contributes tumor growth, progression therapy resistance. restraint pyruvate flux mitochondrial oxidative metabolism cancer cells part attributed inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. Src prominent oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinase promotes cancer cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis resistance conventional targeted therapies. However, potential role Src tumor metabolism remained unclear. report activation Src attenuated PDH activity generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conversely, Src inhibitors activated PDH increased cellular ROS levels. Src inactivated PDH direct phosphorylation tyrosine-289 PDH E1alpha subunit (PDHA1). Indeed, Src main kinase responsible PDHA1 tyrosine phosphorylation cancer cells. Expression tyrosine-289 non-phosphorable PDHA1 mutant Src-hyperactivated cancer cells restored PDH activity, increased mitochondrial respiration oxidative stress, decreased experimental metastasis, sensitized cancer cells pro-oxidant treatment. results suggest Src contributes Warburg phenotype inactivating PDH tyrosine phosphorylation, metabolic effect Src essential Src-driven malignancy therapy resistance. Combination therapies consisting Src inhibitors pro-oxidants may improve anticancer efficacy.
