 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) regulates expression fatty acid (FA) oxidation genes liver heart. Although PPARalpha ligands increased FA oxidation cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiac effects chronic PPARalpha ligand administration vivo studied. Diabetic db/db mouse hearts exhibit characteristics diabetic cardiomyopathy, altered metabolism reduced contractile function. testable hypothesis chronic administration PPARalpha agonist db/db mice normalize cardiac metabolism improve contractile function. Therefore, PPARalpha ligand (BM 17.0744) administered orally control type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice (37.9 +/- 2.5 mg/(kg.d) 8 weeks), effects cardiac metabolism contractile function assessed. BM 17.0744 reduced plasma glucose db/db mice, change observed control mice. FA oxidation significantly reduced BM 17.0744 treated db/db hearts corresponding increase glycolysis glucose oxidation; glucose FA oxidation control hearts unchanged BM 17.0744. PPARalpha treatment alter expression PPARalpha target genes either control diabetic hearts. Therefore, metabolic alterations hearts PPARalpha-treated diabetic mice likely reflect indirect mechanisms related improvement diabetic status vivo. Despite normalization cardiac metabolism, PPARalpha treatment improve cardiac function diabetic hearts.
