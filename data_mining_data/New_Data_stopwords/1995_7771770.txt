 Oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.3) isolated Corynebacterium glutamicum. five steps enzyme purified 300-fold apparent homogeneity. molecular mass estimated gel filtration 118 +/- 6 kDa. SDS-PAGE showed single subunit 31.7 KDa, indicating alpha 4 subunit structure native enzyme. enzyme catalyzed decarboxylation OAA pyruvate CO2, alpha-ketoacids used substrate. cation Mn2+ required full activity, could substituted Mg2+, CO2+, Ni2+ Ca2+. Monovalent ions like Na+, K+ NH4+ required activity. enzyme inhibited Cu2+, Zn2+, ADP, coenzyme succinate. Avidin inhibit enzyme activity, indicating biotin involved decarboxylation OAA. Analysis kinetic properties revealed Km OAA 2.1 mM Km 1.2 mM Mn2+. Vmax 158 mumol OAA converted per min per mg protein, corresponds apparent kcat 311 s-1.
