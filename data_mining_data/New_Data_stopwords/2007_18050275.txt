 Sarcopenia drastic loss skeletal muscle mass strength ageing. order better understand molecular pathogenesis age-related muscle wasting, performed DIGE analysis young adult versus old rat skeletal muscle. Proteomic profiling revealed 2493 separated 2-D spots, 69 proteins exhibited drastically changed expression. Age-dependent alterations protein abundance indicated dramatic changes metabolism, contractile activity, myofibrillar remodelling stress response. contrast decreased levels pyruvate kinase (PK), enolase phosphofructokinase, mitochondrial ATP synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase adenylate kinase (AK) increased senescent fibres. Higher expression levels myoglobin fatty acid binding-protein indicated shift aerobic-oxidative metabolism slower-twitching aged fibre population. drastic increase alphaB-crystallin myotilin demonstrated substantial filament remodelling ageing. immunoblotting survey selected muscle proteins confirmed pathobiochemical transition process aged muscle metabolism. proteomic analysis aged muscle identified large cohort new biomarkers sarcopenia including opposite changes PK AK, might useful design improved diagnostic procedures and/or therapeutic strategies counteract ageing-induced muscle degeneration.
