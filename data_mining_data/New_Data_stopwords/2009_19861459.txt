 Although cancers altered glucose metabolism, termed Warburg effect, describes increased uptake conversion glucose lactate cancer cells adequate oxygen tension, changes metabolism glutamine fatty acid also documented. MYC oncogene, contributes genesis many human cancers, encodes transcription factor c-Myc, links altered cellular metabolism tumorigenesis. c-Myc regulates genes involved biogenesis ribosomes mitochondria, regulation glucose glutamine metabolism. E2F1, c-Myc induces genes involved nucleotide metabolism DNA replication, microRNAs homeostatically attenuate E2F1 expression. hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF-1, ectopic c-Myc cooperatively induces transcriptional program hypoxic adaptation. Myc regulates gene expression either directly, glycolytic genes including lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), indirectly, repression microRNAs miR-23a/b increase glutaminase (GLS) protein expression glutamine metabolism. Ectopic MYC expression cancers, therefore, could concurrently drive aerobic glycolysis and/or oxidative phosphorylation provide sufficient energy anabolic substrates cell growth proliferation context tumor microenvironment. Collectively, studies indicate Myc-mediated altered cancer cell energy metabolism could translated development new anticancer therapies.
