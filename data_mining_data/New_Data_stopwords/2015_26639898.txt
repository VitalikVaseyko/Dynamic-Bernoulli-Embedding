 Changes gene expression tumorigenesis often considered consequence de novo mutations occurring tumour. alternative possibility transcriptional response oncogenic transcription factors evolves tumorigenesis. show aberrant E2f activity, following inactivation Rb gene family mouse model liver cancer, initially activates robust gene expression programme associated cell cycle. Slowly accumulating E2f1 progressively recruits Pontin/Reptin complex open chromatin conformation E2f target genes amplifies E2f transcriptional response. mechanism enhances E2f-mediated transactivation cell cycle genes initiates activation low binding affinity E2f target genes regulate non-cell-cycle functions, Warburg effect. data indicate physiological oncogenic activities E2f result distinct transcriptional responses, could exploited target E2f oncogenic activity therapy.
