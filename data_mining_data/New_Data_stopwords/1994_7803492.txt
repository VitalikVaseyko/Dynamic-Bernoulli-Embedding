 time courses activities aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase pyruvate kinase determined stimulated rat thymocytes 24 h intervals period 72 h culture. parallel mRNA levels enzymes analysed Northern blotting specific probes. enzyme activities corresponding mRNA levels reached maxima 48 h stimulation coinciding S-phase cell cycle. isozyme types aldolase hexokinase resting mitogen-stimulated rat thymocytes identified Northern blot hybridisation using isozyme-specific probes. cells aldolase expressed, whereas type B C could detected. transcription aldolase gene regulated two different promoters. Depending alternative usage promoters aldolase A-specific mRNA either contains non-translated exons M1 AH1. rat thymocytes promoter proximal exon AH1 used expression mRNA I, type characteristic muscle tissue, observed. contrast aldolase two isozyme types hexokinase detected. Hexokinase well hexokinase II present thymocytes whereas hexokinase III detectable. shift isozyme pattern observed cell cycle progression.
