 Isolated hepatocytes incubated presence donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) displayed time- dose-dependent inhibition glucose synthesis lactate plus pyruvate substrate correlated production, nitrite production. Neither parent compound SNAP, N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (NAP), nitrite nitrate significant effect glucose output, indicating inhibition due generation within incubation medium. concentrations required effect (< 800 nM) within range reported occur intact tissues vivo. magnitude inhibitory effect SNAP (approximately 50%) comparable endotoxin treatment rat lactate plus pyruvate substrate. effect SNAP glucose synthesis lactate plus pyruvate synthesis number different substrates examined, showed pattern comparable observed endotoxin treatment rat, suggesting may inhibitory mediator effects bacterial endotoxin hepatic gluconeogenesis. donor effect flux 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, supporting concept primary site inhibition gluconeogenesis endotoxin resides level phosphoenolpyruvate formation.
