 formation adequate masses endocrine exocrine pancreatic tissues embryogenesis essential ensure proper nutrition glucose homeostasis postnatal stages. generated mice pancreas-specific ablation 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) investigate signaling downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) pathway controls pancreas development. Pdk1-conditional knock-out mice born conspicuous pancreas hypoplasia, within weeks, developed severe hyperglycemia. detailed characterization mutant embryonic pancreas also revealed distinct temporal, cell type-specific requirements Pdk1 activity control cell proliferation, cell survival, cell size pancreas development. results thus uncover Pdk1 novel, crucial regulator pancreatic growth embryogenesis. addition, provide evidence Pdk1 activity required differently mature pancreatic cell types, since compensatory proliferation possible mTORC2 activation occurred exocrine cells beta cells Pdk1-deficient postnatal pancreas.
