 PURPOSE: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) master transcription factor hypoxia-induced gene expression. Anesthetics perioperative drugs reported affect HIF-1 activity. However, effect propofol HIF-1 activity well documented. study, investigated effect propofol HIF-1 activation using macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells. METHODS: Cells exposed lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 20 1% O(2) conditions without propofol treatment. cell lysate subjected Western blot analysis using anti-HIF-1alpha HIF-1beta antibodies. HIF-1-dependent gene expression investigated quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis luciferase assay. amount cellular lactate ATP assayed. RESULTS: Propofol suppressed HIF-1alpha protein accumulation induced LPS, hypoxia THP-1 cells dose-dependent manner inhibiting neo-synthesis HIF-1alpha protein. Induction HIF-1 downstream gene expression including glucose transporter 1, enolase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 vascular endothelial growth factor inhibited propofol. Propofol suppressed LPS-induced lactate accumulation ATP content THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: experimental results indicate propofol inhibits HIF-1 activation downstream gene expression induced LPS suppressed HIF-1-dependent glucose metabolic reprogramming. HIF-1 suppression propofol macrophages may explain molecular mechanisms behind inhibitory effect propofol cellular inflammatory responses.
