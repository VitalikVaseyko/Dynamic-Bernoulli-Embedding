 transport pyruvate mitochondria requires specific carrier, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). MPC represents central node carbon metabolism, activity likely play key role bioenergetics. now, investigation MPC activity limited. However, recent molecular identification components carrier allowed us engineer genetically encoded biosensor monitor activity MPC real time cell population single cell. report MPC activity low cancer cells, mainly rely glycolysis generate ATP, characteristic known Warburg effect. show low activity reversed increasing concentration cytosolic pyruvate, thus increasing oxidative phosphorylation. biosensor represents unique tool investigate carbon metabolism bioenergetics various cell types.
