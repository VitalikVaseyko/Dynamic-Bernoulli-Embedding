 macrocytic hypochromic anemia marked reticulocytosis observed 10 examinations 4 month period male Beagle dog 11 months old first examined. owner noticed pale mucous membranes time dog purchased 7 weeks age. Based clinical history negative LE, ANA Coombs tests, intrinsic erythrocyte defect suspected. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility hemoglobin electrophoresis normal. Autohemolysis incubated erythrocytes marked. Hemolysis uncorrected glucose partially corrected ATP. exception pyruvate kinase (PK), erythrocyte enzymes measured greater activities control Beagle erythrocytes. comparison moderately reticulocyte-rich controls. PK activity low affected Beagle. Erythrocyte phosphoenolpyruvate content increased significantly expected PK deficiency. kinetic constant (Km) phosphoenolpyruvate lower normal control dogs, finding agreement studies PK deficient Basenjis. bases diagnosis PK deficiency made.
