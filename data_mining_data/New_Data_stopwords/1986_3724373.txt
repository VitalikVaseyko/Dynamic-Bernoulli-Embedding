 tumor-promoting agent 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (TPA) shown potent stimulator fatty acid synthesis isolated rat hepatocytes. maximal effect TPA seen 10(-6) M, concentration half-maximal effect ca. 10(-8) M. Stimulation fatty acid synthesis TPA shown require presence extracellular Ca++. TPA produces significant increase lactate pyruvate accumulation. possible involvement protein kinase C short-term regulation fatty acid synthesis liver discussed.
