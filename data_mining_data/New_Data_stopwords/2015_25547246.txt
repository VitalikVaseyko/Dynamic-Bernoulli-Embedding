 BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle experience pronounced metabolic adaptations response extrinsic stimuli, expresses leptin receptor (OB-Rb). aimed understanding leptin effects muscle cells, studying expression key energy metabolism genes C2C12 myotubes. METHODS: performed dose-time-dependent study physiological concentrations leptin: 5, 10 50 ng/ml, 0, 30', 3h, 6h, 12h 24h, also monitoring time-course changes non-treated cells. mRNA levels analyzed RT-qPCR peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) protein levels western blot. RESULTS: significant effects observed 50 ng/ml leptin. short-term (30' and/or 3h), leptin significantly induced expression PGC1alpha, muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (mCPT1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), OB-Rb, Insulin receptor (InsR) interleukins 6 15 (IL6, IL15). decrease mRNA levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mCPT1 long-term (24h). PGC1alpha protein levels increased (24h). CONCLUSION: Leptin rapidly induces expression genes important response control metabolic fuels, rapid responses genes encoding master regulator PGC1alpha, mCPT1, UCP3, PDK4 signaling secretory molecule IL6 particularly interesting.
