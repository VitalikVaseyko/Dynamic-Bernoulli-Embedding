 Alloxan diabetes, starvation rabbits within one day administration hydrocortisone 5 days cause distinct alterations total activity pyruvate kinase kidney cortex. time pronounced alterations isozyme spectra observed: L-type activity pyruvate kinase decreased M2-type activity increased. total activity isozyme content pyruvate kinase slightly altered starvation rabbits 3 10-16 days administration protamine-Zn-insulin 3 days. Hydrocortisone caused variable effects pyruvate kinase isozymes kidney cortex, depending periods administration.
