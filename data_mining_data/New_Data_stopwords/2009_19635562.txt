 Pyruvate, key intermediate glucose metabolism, explored potential treatment models experimental stroke inflammation. Pyruvate administered rodents onset middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Since extent inflammation often proportional size infarct, also studied group animals given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cause brain inflammation without cell death. Following MCAO, pyruvate affect physiological parameters significantly reduced infarct volume, improved behavioral tests reduced numbers neutrophils, microglial NFkappaB activation. Animals given LPS showed increased microglial NFkappaB activation almost completely abolished pyruvate. Lactate, major metabolite pyruvate, increased pyruvate administration. However, administration lactate anti-inflammatory effects. Pyruvate protects ischemia possibly blocking inflammation, lactate appear explain pyruvate's anti-inflammatory properties.
