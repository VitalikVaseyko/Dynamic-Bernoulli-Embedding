 common preference cancers lactic acid-generating metabolic energy pathways led proposals reprogrammed metabolism confers growth advantages decreased susceptibility hypoxic stress. Recent observations, however, suggest generates novel way cancer survival. increasing evidence cancers escape immune destruction suppressing anti-cancer immune response maintaining relatively low pH micro-environment. Tumours achieve regulating lactic acid secretion via modification glucose/glutamine metabolisms. propose maintenance cancers relatively low pH micro-environment, via regulation lactic acid secretion selective modification energy metabolism, another major mechanism cancers suppress anti-cancer immune response. Cancer-generated lactic acid could thus viewed critical, immunosuppressive metabolite tumour micro-environment rather 'waste product'. paradigm shift major impact therapeutic strategy development.
