 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates metabolic adaptations skeletal muscle. aim study investigate whether AMPK modulates expression skeletal muscle genes implicated lipid glucose metabolism fed fasting conditions. METHODS: Two genetically modified animal models used: AMPK gamma3 subunit knockout mice (Prkag3(-/-)) skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice (Tg-Prkag3(225Q)) express mutant (R225Q) gamma3 subunit. Levels mRNA transcripts genes involved lipid glucose metabolism white gastrocnemius muscles mice (under fed 16-h fasting conditions) assessed quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Wild-type mice displayed coordinated increase transcription skeletal muscle genes encoding proteins involved lipid/oxidative metabolism (lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid transporter, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 citrate synthase) glucose metabolism (glycogen synthase lactate dehydrogenase) response fasting. contrast, fasting-induced responses impaired Prkag3(-/-) mice. transcription genes involved lipid oxidative metabolism increased skeletal muscle Tg-Prkag3(225Q) mice compared wild-type mice. Moreover, expression genes encoding hexokinase II 6-phosphofrucktokinase decreased Tg-Prkag3(225Q) mice fasting. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: AMPK involved coordinated transcription genes critical lipid glucose metabolism white glycolytic skeletal muscle.
