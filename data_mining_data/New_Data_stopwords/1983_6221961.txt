 1. mutant Neurospora crassa isolated whose pyruvate kinase twice active wild type enzyme. 2. purified mutant wild type enzymes exhibit similar immunological properties, pI values (6.4) Arrhenius activation energy (11.2 kcal/mol). 3. enzymes show hyperbolic saturation kinetics ADP sigmoidal kinetics PEP. 4. mutant enzyme displays higher affinity PEP greater extent cooperativity binding wild type. 5. Conformational alterations mutant enzyme inferred basis electrophoretic analyses denaturation urea, SDS heat.
