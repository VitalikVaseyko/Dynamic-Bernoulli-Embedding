 Unopposed PI3-kinase activity 3'-phosphoinositide production Jurkat cells, due mutation PTEN tumour suppressor protein, results deregulation PH domain-containing proteins including serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt. Jurkat cells, PKB/Akt constitutively active phosphorylated activation-loop residue (Thr308). 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), enzyme also contains PH domain, thought catalyse Thr308 phosphorylation PKB/Akt addition kinase families PKC isoforms. unknown however loss PTEN Jurkat cells also results unregulated PDK-1 activity whether loss impacts activation-loop phosphorylation putative PDK-1 substrates PKC. study addressed loss PTEN Jurkat cells affects PDK-1 catalytic activity intracellular localisation. demonstrate reducing level 3'-phosphoinositides Jurkat cells pharmacological inhibitors PI3-kinase expression PTEN affect PDK-1 activity, Ser241 phosphorylation intracellular localisation. support finding, show levels PKC activation-loop phosphorylation unaffected reductions levels 3'-phosphoinositides. Instead, dephosphorylation occurs PKB/Akt Thr308 following reductions 3'-phosphoinositides dependent PP2A-like phosphatase activity. finding PDK-1 functions independently 3'-phosphoinositides cells also confirmed studies HuT-78 cells, PTEN-expressing cell line undetectable levels 3'-phosphoinositides. conclude therefore loss PTEN expression Jurkat cells impact PDK-1/PKC pathway subset kinases, PKB/Akt, perturbed consequence PTEN loss.
