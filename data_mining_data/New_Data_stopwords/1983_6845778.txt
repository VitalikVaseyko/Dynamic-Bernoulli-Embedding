 simplest methods diagnosis thalassaemias morphology erythrocytes, Hb-F-elution test Hb H Heinz bodies test. order prove sickle cell anomaly sickle cell preparation Hb-S-precipitation test performed every laboratory. means isopropanol precipitation test Heinz bodies test searched instable haemoglobins without laboratory expenditure. hand, haemoglobins increased oxygen affinity demand measurement oxygen affinity erythrocytes. However, simple fluorescence dye-stuff methods disposal important erythrocytic enzymopenias.
