 Recent data suggested mitochondria play supportive role maintaining tumorigenic phenotype. Indeed, antimitochondrial agents hypothesized potential chemosensitizers human malignancy. assessed utility approach characterizing antimitochondrial activity 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzylidene-malononitrile (AG17), combination 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) two human glioblastoma cell lines. AG17 (NSC 242557) tyrphostin thought antimitochondrial activity, limited tyrosine kinase antagonism, used noncytotoxic nongrowth-inhibitory concentrations (0.25 microM). Glioblastoma cells incubated AG17, changes mitochondrial activity determined. Tumor cells became auxotrophically dependent uridine pyruvate, indicating lack functioning respiratory chain. Despite this, cells continued exhibit growth-inhibitory effects. Exposure AG17 associated significant depolarization mitochondrial membrane potential decreases mitochondrial mass glioblastoma cell lines, correlating finding auxotrophic dependence. contrast, normal human astrocytes treated dose AG17 show changes growth, mitochondrial membrane potential, mass. Indeed, auxotrophic dependence uridine pyruvate could established cells. Glioblastoma cells became significantly responsive BCNU chemotherapy AG17 pretreatment; linear relationship noted correlated number well percentage polarized mitochondria glioblastoma cell survival highest dose BCNU used (144 microg/ml). Normal human astrocytes change regard dose response BCNU previous incubation AG17. difference found type cellular death (apoptosis) either glioblastoma cell lines, BCNU treatment alone, combination AG17 BCNU, despite decrease polarized mitochondria mitochondrial mass. AG17 antimitochondrial properties used low dose human glioblastoma, relatively specific tumor cells compared normal astrocytes. use AG17 chemosensitizer, drugs BCNU, offers new possibly effective approach developed patients glial tumors.
