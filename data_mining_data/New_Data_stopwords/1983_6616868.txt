 Plasma pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK) measured healthy subjects engaging (a) mild exercise, 30 min exercise cycle maintaining pulse rate 150/min, (b) moderate exercise, squeezing ball exhaustion sphygmomanometer cuff inflated systolic pressure around arm (max. 2 min) (c) severe exercise, completing marathon race. Mild exercise resulted change enzyme levels 24 h. Moderate exercise produced small increase PK change CK. PK activity rose 35.3 +/- 10 U/l pre-exercise 41.3 +/- 13 U/l 15 min post-exercise (n = 8, p less 0.025). Severe exercise (completing marathon race) resulted 3-fold increase PK 26 (4-87) U/l pre-race 69 (21-156) U/l immediately post-race, also, expected, increase CK 60 (15-164) U/l 257 (72-1535) U/l (results means ranges, n = 69, p less 0.001 enzymes). Runners showed parallel increases PK CK (p less 0.05 Spearman rank correlation). mean post-race activity CK-MB less 5% total CK 18 runners values greater 6% (mean 4.8, range 1-18). conclude PK, like CK, increased following exercise due liberation muscle enzyme. However, severe exercise likely lead substantial increase plasma PK activity therefore prejudice clinical usefulness diagnostic test.
