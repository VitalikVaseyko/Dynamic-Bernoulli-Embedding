 Melatonin plays neuroprotective role brain injury activation Akt inhibition apoptotic cell death. study investigated whether melatonin modulates anti-apoptotic signal activation Akt downstream targets, FKHR, AFX, 14-3-3. Adult male rats treated melatonin (5 mg/kg) prior middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) brain tissues collected 24 hr MCAO. study confirmed melatonin significantly reduces infarct volume decreases number TUNEL-positive cells cerebral cortex. Potential activation measured phosphorylation PDK1 Ser(241), Akt Ser(473), FKHR Ser(256), AFX Ser(193) using Western blot analysis. Melatonin prevented injury-induced reduction pPDK1, pAkt, pFKHR, pAFX. However, melatonin affect level 14-3-3, acts anti-apoptotic factor interaction pFKHR. Further, presence melatonin, interaction pFKHR 14-3-3 increased, compared control animals. study suggests melatonin plays potent protective role brain injury Akt activation FKHR phosphorylation melatonin mediated protective effects.
