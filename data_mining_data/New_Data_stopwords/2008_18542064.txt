 describe expression function HIF-1-regulated protein pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1) head neck squamous cancer (HNSCC). Using RNAi downregulate hypoxia-inducible PDK-1, found lactate pyruvate excretion 16-48 h hypoxia suppressed normoxic levels. indicates PDK-1 plays important role maintaining glycolysis. Knockdown effect proliferation survival hypoxia. immunohistochemical expression PDK-1 assessed 140 cases HNSCC. PDK-1 expression expressed normal tissues upregulated HNSCC found predominantly cytoplasmic occasional strong focal nuclear expression. strongly related poor outcome (P=0.005 split median). results indicate HIF regulation PDK-1 key role maintaining lactate production human cancer investigation PDK-1 inhibitors investigated antitumour effects.
