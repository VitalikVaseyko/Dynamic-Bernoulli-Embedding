 BACKGROUND: potential biodiesel plant castor bean (Ricinus communis) limelight bioenergy research due availability genome raises bar genome-wide studies claiming advances impact "genome-phenome challenge". report application phytohormone ABA exogenous factor improvement storage reserve accumulation focus complex interaction pathways associated seed filling. RESULTS: application exogenous ABA treatments, measured increased ABA levels developing seeds cultured vitro using ELISA technique quantified content major biomolecules (including total lipids, sugars protein) treated seeds. Exogenous ABA (10 muM) enhanced accumulation soluble sugar content (6.3%) followed deposition total lipid content (4.9 %). elucidate possible ABA signal transduction pathways towards overall seed filling, studied differential gene expression analysis using Illumina RNA-Sequencing technology, resulting 2568 (1507-up/1061-down regulated) differentially expressed genes identified. genes involved sugar metabolism (such glucose-6-phosphate, fructose 1,6 bis-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate, pyruvate kinase), lipid biosynthesis (such ACS, ACBP, GPAT2, GPAT3, FAD2, FAD3, SAD1 DGAT1), storage proteins synthesis (such SGP1, zinc finger protein, RING H2 protein, nodulin 55 cytochrome P450), ABA biosynthesis (such NCED1, NCED3 beta carotene). Further, confirmed validation RNA-Sequencing data Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, metabolite measurements supported genes pathway expression results indicated study provide new insights understand ABA signaling mechanism towards seed storage filling also contribute useful information facilitating oilseed crop functional genomics aim utilizing castor bean agricultural bioenergy use.
