 Acute deficiency pancreatic peptides (insulin, somatostatin-25, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide) invoked 9-12 hr coho, Oncorhynchus kisutch, chinook, O. tshawytscha, salmon administration specific antisera raised purified salmon hormones. Insulin-deficient fish hyperglycemic, diminished glycogen content liver (Plisetskaya et al., '88a, elevated liver triacylglycerol lipase activity, higher concentration plasma triiodothyronine (T3) compared control group fish injected nonspecific rabbit serum. immunoneutralization somatostatin-25, fish remained normoglycemic, higher liver glycogen content, decreased lipase activity, elevated plasma levels insulin, levels T3 declined. induced deficiency glucagon family peptides led comparatively smaller changes: liver glycogen content increased anti-glucagon-like peptide (aGLP) injection transient hyperglycemia apparent following anti-glucagon (aGLU) administration. Circulating levels insulin remained unaffected least 9 hr following aGLU aGLP treatments. velocity pyruvate kinase 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (V2.5) depressed, especially combined administration aGLU + aGLP. effectiveness immunoneutralization experiments greatly dependent particular stage fish life cycle. Antisera fish pancreatic peptides proved suitable tool studies hormonal regulation fish metabolism.
