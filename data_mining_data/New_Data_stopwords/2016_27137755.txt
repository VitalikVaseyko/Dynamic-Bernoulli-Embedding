 aggressiveness triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacks estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), represents major challenge breast cancer. Migratory self-renewal capabilities integral components invasion, metastasis recurrence TNBC. Elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression associated aggressiveness cancer. Nonetheless, HIF-1alpha expression regulated HIF-1alpha induces aggressive phenotype completely understood TNBC. cytotoxic effects farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) studied cancer leukemia cells. contrast, effect FTIs HIF-1alpha expression yet studied. Here, show clinically relevant low-dose FTI, tipifarnib (300 nM), decreased HIF-1alpha expression, migration tumorsphere formation human MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells normoxic condition. contrast, low-dose FTIs inhibit cell growth activity Ras pathway MDA-MB 231 cells. Tipifarnib-induced decrease HIF-1alpha expression associated amelioration Warburg effect, hypermetabolic state, increases Snail expression ATP release, suppressed E-cadherin expression, major contributors invasion, metastasis recurrence TBNC. data suggest FTIs may capable ameliorating aggressive phenotype TNBC suppressing HIF-1alpha-Snail pathway.
