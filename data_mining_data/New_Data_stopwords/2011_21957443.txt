 Cancer cells adopt glycolysis major source metabolic energy production fast cell growth. HIF-1-induced PFKFB3 plays key role adaptation elevating concentration Fru-2,6-BP, potent glycolysis stimulator. metabolic conversion suggested hallmark cancer, PFKFB3 emerged novel target cancer chemotherapy. Here, report small molecular inhibitor, N4A, identified initial lead compound PFKFB3 inhibitor therapeutic potential. attempt improve potency, determined crystal structure PFKFB3*N4A complex 2.4 resolution and, exploiting resulting molecular information, attained potent YN1. tested cultured cancer cells, N4A YN1 inhibited PFKFB3, suppressing Fru-2,6-BP level, turn suppressed glycolysis and, ultimately, led cell death. study validates PFKFB3 target new cancer therapies provides framework future development efforts.
