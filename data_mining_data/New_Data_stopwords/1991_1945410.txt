 product proto-oncogene fos nuclear phosphoprotein. investigated nuclear location Fos protein mediated nuclear targeting sequence. show cytoplasmic chicken pyruvate kinase protein translocates nucleus fused 22 amino acid Fos basic region (amino acids 139-161). However, nuclear localization Fos protein affected basic region deleted. propose Fos protein contains multiple nuclear targeting sequences may act independently concert one another.
