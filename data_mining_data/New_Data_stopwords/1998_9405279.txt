 administration low-carbohydrate/high-saturated-fat (LC/HF) diet 28 days starvation 48 h increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) activity extracts rat hepatic mitochondria, approx. 2.1-fold 3.5-fold respectively. ELISAs extracts hepatic mitochondria, conducted range pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities, revealed mitochondrial immunoreactive PDHKII (the major PDHK isoform rat liver) significantly increased approx. 1.4-fold 28 days LC/HF feeding approx. 2-fold 48 h starvation. effect LC/HF feeding increase hepatic PDHK activity retained hepatocyte preparation, decreased 21 h culture insulin (100 micro-i.u./ml). sustained (24 h) 2-4-fold elevation plasma insulin concentration vivo (achieved insulin infusion via osmotic pump) suppressed effect LC/HF feeding hepatic PDHK activities differ significantly (insulin-infused) control rats. increase hepatic PDHK activity evoked 28 days LC/HF feeding prevented reversed (within 24 h) replacement 7% dietary lipid long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. Analysis hepatic membrane lipid revealed 1.9-fold increase ratio total polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids total mono-unsaturated fatty acids. results indicate increased hepatic PDHK activities observed livers LC/HF-fed 48 h-starved rats associated long-term actions increase hepatic PDHKII concentrations. long-term regulation hepatic PDHK LC/HF feeding might achieved impaired action insulin suppress PDHK activity. addition, fatty acid composition diet, rather fat content, key influence.
