 kinetic regulatory properties cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PKc) isolated endosperm germinating castor oil seeds (Ricinus communis L.) studied. Optimal efficiency substrate utilization (in terms Vmax/Km phosphoenolpyruvate ADP) occurred pH 6.7 7.4. Enzyme activity absolutely dependent presence bivalent univalent metal cation, Mg2+ K+ fulfilling requirement. Mg2+ binding showed positive negative co-operativity pH 6.5 (h = 1.6) pH 7.2 (h = 0.69) respectively. Hyperbolic saturation kinetics observed phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) K+, whereas ADP acted mixed-type inhibitor 1 mM. Glycerol (10%, v/v) increased S0.5(ADP) 2.3-fold altered pattern nucleotide binding hyperbolic (h = 1.0) sigmoidal (h = 1.79) without modifying PEP saturation kinetics. activators identified. ATP, AMP, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, malate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, glycerol 3-phosphate phosphoglycolate effective inhibitors. metabolites yielded additive inhibition tested pairs. ATP 3-phosphoglycerate mixed-type inhibitors respect PEP, whereas competitive inhibition observed inhibitors. Inhibition malate, 2-oxoglutarate, phosphorylated triose sugars phosphoglycolate far pronounced pH 7.2 pH 6.5. Although 32P-labelling studies revealed extensive phosphorylation vivo soluble endosperm proteins occurred days 3 5 seed germination, alteration 32P-labelling pattern 5-day-germinated endosperm observed 30 min anaerobiosis. Moreover, evidence obtained PKc phosphoprotein aerobic anoxic endosperms. proposed endosperm PKc activity germinating castor seeds enhanced anaerobiosis concerted decreases ATP levels, cytosolic pH concentrations several key inhibitors.
