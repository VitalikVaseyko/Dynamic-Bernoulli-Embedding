 Catecholamines carnitine blood levels closely implicated training. aim study investigate effect sympathetic nervous system stimulation carnitine fraction levels training. Blood obtained 14 soccer players pregame, intermission, postgame. Catecholamines measured high-performance liquid chromatography methods; muscle enzymes creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase well lactate, pyruvate, total antioxidant status commercial kits; carnitine fraction levels tandem mass spectrometry. Total antioxidant status (2.97 +/- 0.13 vs 0.96 +/- 0.10 mmol/L, P < .01) well free carnitine levels (20.47 +/- 4.0 vs 12.30 +/- 2.8 micromol/L, P < .001) remarkably decreased especially postgame. Total acylcarnitines (5.20 +/- 1.8 vs 9.42 +/- 3.0 micromol/L, P < .001) especially total long-chain acylcarnitines (0.80 +/- 0.01 vs 1.85 +/- 0.03 micromol/L, P < .001) well catecholamine levels (adrenaline: 230 +/- 31 vs 890 +/- 110 pmol/L, P < .01; noradrenaline: 1.53 +/- 0.41 vs 3.7 +/- 0.6 nmol/L, P < .01) significantly increased players postgame. statistically significant inverse correlation found adrenaline free carnitine (r = -0.51, P < .01); positive correlation found adrenaline, total acylcarnitines (r = 0.58, P < .01), total long-chain acylcarnitine (r = 0.49, P < .01). significant positive correlation adrenaline levels total acylcarnitine total long-chain acylcarnitine blood levels athletes well inverse correlation free carnitine levels may indicate participation stimulated sympathetic nervous system regulation carnitine fraction levels exercise.
