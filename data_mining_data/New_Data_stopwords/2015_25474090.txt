 previous phylogenetic study family pyruvate kinase, found one cluster Glu117 another Lys117. sequences Glu117 Thr113 K+-dependent, whereas Lys117 Leu113 K+-independent. carbonyl oxygen Thr113 one residues coordinate K+ active site. Even though side chain Thr113 participate binding K+, strict co-evolution position 117 113 suggests T113 may result evolutionary pressure maintain selectivity pyruvate kinase activity K+. Thus, explored replacement Thr113 Leu alters characteristics K+ binding site. found polarity residue 113 central partition K+ site substitution Thr Leu changes ion selectivity monovalent cation minor changes binding substrates. Therefore, Thr113 instrumental selectivity pyruvate kinase K+.
