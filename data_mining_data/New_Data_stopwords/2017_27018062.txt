 Theileria obligatory intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite causes economic losses cattle, sheep goats industry. However, little information available genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes ovine parasites, Theileria luwenshuni Theileria uilenbergi. Differences protein expression species investigated better understand biology. Parasites digested trypsin, resulting peptides labeled isobaric tags relative absolute quantification, followed LC-MS/MS. 670 proteins, classified categories primarily related cellular process (29.78%), metabolic process (28.80%), localization (5.22%) biological regulation (5.00%), identified. Seventy-one proteins differentially expressed; T. luwenshuni 39 proteins highly expressed T. uilenbergi, whereas T. uilenbergi 32 highly expressed. Several proteins related parasite virulence invasion (cysteine proteinase, histone deacetylase, pyruvate kinase, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) differentially expressed. Real-time quantitative PCR validated protein expression changes transcript level. first report protein expression two economically important Theileria species China, findings may provide novel opportunities ovine caprine theileriosis control.
