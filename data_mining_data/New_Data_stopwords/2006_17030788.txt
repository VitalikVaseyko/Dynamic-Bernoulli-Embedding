 Previous investigations show intracerebroventricular administration potent inhibitor fatty acid synthase, C75, increases level substrate, malonyl-CoA, hypothalamus. "malonyl-CoA signal" rapidly transmitted skeletal muscle sympathetic nervous system, increasing fatty acid oxidation, uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) expression, thus, energy expenditure. Here, show intracerebroventricular intraperitoneal administration C75 increases number mitochondria white red (soleus) skeletal muscle. Consistent signal transmission hypothalamus sympathetic nervous system, centrally administered C75 rapidly (< =2 h) up-regulated expression (in skeletal muscle) beta-adrenergic signaling molecules, i.e., norepinephrine, beta3-adrenergic receptor, cAMP; transcriptional regulators peroxisomal proliferator activator regulator gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) estrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha); expression key oxidative mitochondrial enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, medium-chain length fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, ubiquinone-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase, well ATP synthase UCP3. role PGC-1alpha mediating responses muscle assessed C2C12 myocytes cell culture. Consistent vivo response, adenovirus-directed expression PGC-1alpha C2C12 muscle cells provoked phosphorylation/inactivation reduced expression acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, causing reduction malonyl-CoA concentration. effects, coupled increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b, led increased fatty acid oxidation. PGC-1alpha also increased expression ERRalpha, PPARalpha, enzymes support mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, thermogenesis, apparently mediated increased expression UCP3.
