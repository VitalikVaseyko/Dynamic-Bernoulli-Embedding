 incubation isolated rat hepatocytes vanadate increased concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate without modifying 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity. Vanadate also reverted prevented decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, "active" form 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase pyruvate kinase activity ratio produced glucagon, probably counteracting increase cyclic AMP concentration.
