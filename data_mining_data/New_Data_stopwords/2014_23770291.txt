 Recent studies indicated regulation innate immunity energy metabolism connected together antagonistic crosstalk NF-kappaB SIRT1 signaling pathways. NF-kappaB signaling major role innate immunity defense SIRT1 regulates oxidative respiration cellular survival. However, NF-kappaB signaling stimulate glycolytic energy flux acute inflammation, whereas SIRT1 activation inhibits NF-kappaB signaling enhances oxidative metabolism resolution inflammation. SIRT1 inhibits NF-kappaB signaling directly deacetylating p65 subunit NF-kappaB complex. SIRT1 stimulates oxidative energy production via activation AMPK, PPARalpha PGC-1alpha simultaneously, factors inhibit NF-kappaB signaling suppress inflammation. hand, NF-kappaB signaling down-regulates SIRT1 activity expression miR-34a, IFNgamma, reactive oxygen species. inhibition SIRT1 disrupts oxidative energy metabolism stimulates NF-kappaB-induced inflammatory responses present many chronic metabolic age-related diseases. examine molecular mechanisms antagonistic signaling NF-kappaB SIRT1 describe crosstalk controls inflammatory process energy metabolism. addition, discuss disturbances signaling crosstalk induce appearance chronic inflammation metabolic diseases.
