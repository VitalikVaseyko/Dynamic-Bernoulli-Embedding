 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) non-invasive antitumor treatment uses combination photosensitizer, tissue oxygen, visible light irradiation produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, predominantly singlet oxygen. Currently, first-generation PDT using porfimer sodium excimer dye laser, second-generation PDT using talaporfin sodium PDT semiconductor laser approved health insurance use Japan. However, cancer cell specificity selectivity treatments inadequate. Cancer cells consume higher levels glucose normal cells phenomenon known Warburg effect. Thus, developed third-generation PDT, based Warburg effect, synthesizing novel photosensitizer, sugar-conjugated chlorin, increased cancer cell-selective accumulation. Glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) PDT showed significantly stronger antitumor effects second-generation talaporfin PDT. also found PDT G-chlorin induced immunogenic cell death characterized secretion, release, surface exposure damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin (CRT) high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein. Mannose-conjugated chlorin (M-chlorin) PDT targets mannose receptors surface cancer cells tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) cancer tissue stroma also showed strong antitumor effects. novel PDTs using glucose M-chlorins stand new candidates effective, next-generation PDTs.
