 Cancer cells consume glucose secrete lactate culture. unknown whether lactate contributes energy metabolism living tumors. previously reported human non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) oxidize glucose tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here, show lactate also TCA cycle carbon source NSCLC. human NSCLC, evidence lactate utilization apparent tumors high (18)fluorodeoxyglucose uptake aggressive oncological behavior. Infusing human NSCLC patients (13)C-lactate revealed extensive labeling TCA cycle metabolites. mice, deleting monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) tumor cells eliminated lactate-dependent metabolite labeling, confirming tumor-cell-autonomous lactate uptake. Strikingly, directly comparing lactate glucose metabolism vivo indicated lactate's contribution TCA cycle predominates. data indicate tumors, including bona fide human NSCLC, use lactate fuel vivo.
