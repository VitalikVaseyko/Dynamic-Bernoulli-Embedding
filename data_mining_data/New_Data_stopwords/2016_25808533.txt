 Although, metformin drug first choice treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus, molecular action fully determined. widely accepted antihyperglycemic effect metformin result decrease hepatic glucose production, several cellular targets drug proposed. reduction gluconeogenesis evoked metformin may result energy deficit evoked inhibition mitochondrial respiratory chain complex and/or increased cytosolic redox state decreased mitochondrial redox state elicited inhibition mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD). Metformin mediated reduction hepatic gluconeogenesis found AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) dependent independent, including inhibition gluconeogenesis gene expression allosteric regulation key gluconeogenesis enzymes. Recently, reported inhibition mGPD metformin decreases level dihydroxyacetone phosphate reduces conversion lactate pyruvate, consequence diminishes utilization glycerol lactate gluconeogenesis. purpose paper discus molecular mechanisms responsible metabolic action metformin.
