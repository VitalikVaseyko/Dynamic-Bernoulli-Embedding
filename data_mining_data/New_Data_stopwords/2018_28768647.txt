 BACKGROUND: Environmental cold-induced hypertension common, treat cold-induced hypertension remains obstacle. Transient receptor potential melastatin subtype 8 (TRPM8) mild cold-sensing nonselective cation channel activated menthol. Little known effect TRPM8 activation menthol mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis vascular function cold-induced hypertension. METHODS RESULTS: Primary vascular smooth muscle cells wild-type Trpm8(-/-) mice cultured. vitro, confirmed sarcoplasmic reticulum-resident TRPM8 participated regulation cellular mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis vascular smooth muscle cells. TRPM8 activation menthol antagonized angiotensin II induced mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction excess reactive oxygen species generation preserving pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, hindered reactive oxygen species-triggered Ca(2+) influx activation RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. vivo, long-term noxious cold stimulation dramatically increased vasoconstriction blood pressure. activation TRPM8 dietary menthol inhibited vascular reactive oxygen species generation, vasoconstriction, lowered blood pressure attenuating excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediated activation RhoA/Rho kinase TRPM8-dependent manner. effects menthol validated angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dietary menthol treatment targeting preserving mitochondrial function may represent nonpharmaceutical measure environmental noxious cold-induced hypertension.
