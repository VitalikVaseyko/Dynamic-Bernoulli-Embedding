 Skeletal muscle biopsies performed 12 healthy sedentary subjects 22 non-dyalized chronic renal failure patients (CRF) free diet overnight fasting. Parathormone, glucagon insulin determined time biopsies. CRF patients showed significantly low ATP creatine phosphate levels. Regarding enzyme activities, high hexokinase Vmax found, pyruvate kinase activity lower control group. tricarboxylic acid cycle, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase activities higher; total NADH cytochrome c reductase activity also high, cytochrome oxidase activity slightly lower. alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase activities considerably high comparison control group. conclusion, study revealed hypermetabolic TCA cycle, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, partly explained reduced ATP concentration. Excessive protein intake hormonal derangements may play role metabolic changes.
