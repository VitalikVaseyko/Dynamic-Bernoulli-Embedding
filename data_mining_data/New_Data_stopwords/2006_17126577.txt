 assessed daily patterns parameters involved energy metabolism plasma brain rainbow trout. daily rhythms found, analyzed potential influence feeding. Immature rainbow trout randomly distributed 3 groups: fish fed 7 days, fish fasted 7 days, fish fasted 7 days refed 4 days. sampling day, fish fed refed groups fed 11.00 h, fish sampled treatment group using following time schedule: 14.00, 18.00, 21.00, 00.00, 04.00, 07.00, 10.00 14.00 h. results obtained metabolic parameters assessed plasma brain grouped three different categories, (i) displaying 24 h changes fed fish plasma lactate, protein acetoacetate levels, well brain amino acid protein levels, lowKm(glucose) hexokinase, aspartate aminotransferase activities, (ii) displaying 24 h changes apparently dependent feeding since disappeared fasted fish case plasma cortisol, glucose triglyceride levels, well brain glycogen, glucose, lactate levels, pyruvate kinase hexokinase IV activities, (iii) parameters displaying 24 h changes apparently dependent feeding plasma amino acids, brain acetoacetate levels well several enzyme activities measured brain glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase-oxidase. general, 24 h changes dependent feeding indicate increased use glucose brain several hours post-feeding whereas changes dependent feeding characterized reduced levels/activity night period suggesting metabolic depression brain darkness.
