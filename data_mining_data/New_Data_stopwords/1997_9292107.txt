 activity important glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, phosphohexoseisomerase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase) glutaminolytic enzymes (phosphate-dependent glutaminase) determined thymus mesenteric lymph nodes Wistar rats submitted protein malnutrition (6% protein diet rather 20%) conception 12 weeks birth. wet weight (g) thymus mesenteric lymph nodes decreased due protein malnutrition 87% (from 0.30 +/- 0.05 0.04 +/- 0.01) 75% (0.40 +/- 0.04 0.10 +/- 0.02), respectively. protein content reduced thymus 102.3 +/- 4.4 (control rats) 72.6 +/- 6.6 (malnourished rats). glycolytic enzymes affected protein malnutrition, glutaminase activity thymus lymph nodes reduced half protein-malnourished rats compared controls. fact may lead decrease cellularity organ thus size, weight protein content.
