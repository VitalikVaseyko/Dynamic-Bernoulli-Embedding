 Pyruvate kinase isozyme type M2(PKM2) first found hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), expression thought correlate prognosis. large number studies demonstrated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial event hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated metastasis, resulting enhanced malignancy HCC. However, roles PKM2 HCC EMT metastasis remain largely unknown. present study aimed determine effects PKM2 EGF-induced HCC EMT elucidate molecular mechanisms vitro. results showed EGF promoted EMT HCC cell lines evidenced altered morphology, expression EMT-associated markers, enhanced invasion capacity. Furthermore, present study also revealed nuclear translocation PKM2, regulated ERK pathway, regulated beta-catenin-TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity associated EMT HCC cell lines. discoveries provide evidence novel roles PKM2 progression HCC potential therapeutic target advanced cases.
