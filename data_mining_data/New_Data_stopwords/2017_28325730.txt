 Myocardial reperfusion decreases glucose oxidation uncouples glucose oxidation glycolysis. Therapies increase glucose oxidation lessen myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, regulation glucose uptake reperfusion remains poorly understood. found glucose uptake remarkably diminished myocardium following reperfusion Sprague-Dawley rats detected (18)F-labeled fluorescent-labeled glucose analogs, even though GLUT1 upregulated threefold GLUT4 translocation remained unchanged compared sham-treated rats. decreased glucose uptake accompanied suppressed glucose oxidation. Interestingly, stimulating glucose oxidation inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), rate-limiting enzyme glucose oxidation, increased glucose uptake alleviated I/R injury. vitro data neonatal myocytes showed PDK4 overexpression decreased glucose uptake, whereas knockdown increased glucose uptake, suggesting PDK4 role regulating glucose uptake. Moreover, inhibition PDK4 increased myocardial glucose uptake concomitant enhancement cardiac insulin sensitivity following myocardial I/R. results showed suppressed glucose oxidation mediated PDK4 contributes reduced glucose uptake myocardium following reperfusion, enhancement glucose uptake exerts cardioprotection. findings suggest stimulating glucose oxidation via PDK4 could efficient approach improve recovery myocardial I/R injury.
