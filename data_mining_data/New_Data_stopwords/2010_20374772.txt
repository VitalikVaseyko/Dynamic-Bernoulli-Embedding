 objective study investigate association PKM2 gene glycolytic potential meat quality traits three groups fatteners - Landrace, Landrace x Yorkshire (Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc. present study conducted 243 fatteners, free RYR1(T) gene, 95 Landrace breed rest following crosses: 66 - Landrace x Yorkshire 82 (Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc. stated, PKM2 gene (independently breed) significantly associated GP, lactate content, R(1) indicator, pH drip loss. presence TT genotype may lead increase GP lactate content results low pH(24) pH(144) bigger drip loss measured 96 144 h slaughter. Except landrace fatteners, association PKM2 gene glycogen content statistically confirmed. Statistically confirmed interaction shows, association PKM2 gene glycolytic potential glycogen content concerns mainly Landrace pigs. Moreover, high (almost 89%) conformability genotype PKM2 gene RN(-) phenotype, serve additional argument favour thesis.
