 new analytical approach applied determination characterization mercury-accessible -SH groups pure native protein samples (ovalbumin, hemoglobin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, lysozyme, cytochrome c). method based selective reduction Hg(II) presence Hg(II)-thiol complexes alkaline sodium tetrahydroborate, give Hg(0) continuous flow reaction system coupled atomic fluorescence spectrometric (AFS) detection. method fast specific allows one work nanomole amounts single protein without preliminary incubation without separation Hg(II) thiol-complexed mercury. meaning results obtained determination accessible -SH groups native proteins using chemical probes discussed.
