 Protein kinases regulate numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, metabolism, cell death. primary sequence three-dimensional structure many kinases highly similar, development selective inhibitors one kinase challenging. Furthermore, many protein kinases pleiotropic, mediating diverse sometimes even opposing functions phosphorylating multiple protein substrates. Here, set develop inhibitor selective protein kinase phosphorylation one substrates. Focusing pleiotropic delta protein kinase C (deltaPKC), used rational approach identify distal docking site deltaPKC substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). reasoned inhibitor PDK's docking selectively inhibit phosphorylation PDK without affecting phosphorylation deltaPKC substrates. approach identified selective inhibitor PDK docking deltaPKC vitro Kd approximately 50 nM reducing cardiac injury IC50 approximately 5 nM. inhibitor, affect phosphorylation deltaPKC substrates even 1 muM, demonstrated PDK phosphorylation alone critical deltaPKC-mediated injury heart attack. approach describe likely applicable identification substrate-specific kinase inhibitors.
