 aim study characterize function mitochondria main energy fluxes human colorectal cancer (HCC) cells. performed quantitative analysis cellular respiration post-operative tissue samples collected 42 cancer patients. Permeabilized tumor tissue combination high resolution respirometry used. results indicate HCC pure glycolytic tumor oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system may main provider ATP tumor cells. apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) ADP maximal respiratory rate (Vm) values calculated characterization affinity mitochondria exogenous ADP: normal colon tissue displayed low affinity (Km = 260 +/- 55 muM) whereas affinity tumor mitochondria significantly higher (Km = 126 +/- 17 muM). concurrently Vm value tumor samples 60-80% higher control tissue. reason change related increased number mitochondria. data suggest HCC normal intestinal cells tubulin beta-II isoform probably play role regulation permeability MOM adenine nucleotides. mitochondrial creatine kinase energy transfer system functional HCC experiments showed adenylate kinase reactions could play important role maintenance energy homeostasis colorectal carcinomas instead creatine kinase. Immunofluorescent studies showed hexokinase 2 (HK-2) associated mitochondria HCC cells, carcinogenesis total activity HK change. Furthermore, minor alterations expression HK-1 HK-2 isoforms observed. Metabolic Control analysis showed distribution control electron transport chain ATP synthasome complexes seemed similar tumor control tissues. High flux control coefficients point possibility mitochondrial respiratory chain reorganized way assembled large supercomplexes tissues.
