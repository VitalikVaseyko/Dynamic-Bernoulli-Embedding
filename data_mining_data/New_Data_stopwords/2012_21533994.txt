 Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) evolutionarily conserved enzymes involved many biological processes metastasis, proliferation, development, differentiation, ciliary functions, vesicle transport apoptosis vertebrates. Biochemical mechanisms processes still largely unknown. Sponges (Porifera) simple metazoans without tissues, closest common ancestor animals. changed little evolution probably provide best insight metazoan ancestors' genomic features. purpose study address structural functional properties group II Nme6 gene/protein ortholog marine sponge Suberites domuncula, Nme6, order elucidate evolutionary history. Sponge Nme6 gene promoter sequenced analysed various bioinformatical tools. Nme6 Nme6Delta31 proteins produced E. coli strain BL21 NDPK activity measured using coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay. Subcellular localization human tumour cells examined confocal scanning microscopy. results show sponge Nme6 compared human Nme6 possess NDPK activity, localize mitochondria least human cells although putative mitochondrial signal sequence, lacks two recent introns comprise miRNAs different transcriptional binding sites promoter region. Therefore, conclude structure Nme6 gene changed metazoan evolution possibly correlation function protein.
