 Ligon lintless-1 (Li1) monogenic dominant mutant Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) phenotype impaired vegetative growth short lint fibers. Despite years research involving genetic mapping gene expression profile analysis Li1 mutant ovule tissues, gene remains uncloned underlying pathway cotton fiber elongation still unclear. study, report whole genome-level deep-sequencing analysis leaf tissues Li1 mutant. Differentially expressed genes leaf tissues mutant versus wild-type (WT) plants identified, underlying pathways potential genes control leaf fiber development inferred. results show transcription factors AS2, YABBY5, KANDI-like significantly differentially expressed mutant tissues compared WT ones. Interestingly, several fiber development-related genes found downregulated gene list mutant leaf transcriptome. genes include heat shock protein family, cytoskeleton arrangement, cell wall synthesis, energy, H2O2 metabolism-related genes, WRKY transcription factors. finding suggests genes involved leaf morphology determination fiber elongation. expression data also compared previously published microarray data Li1 ovule tissues. Comparative analysis ovule transcriptomes Li1 WT reveals number pathways important fiber elongation enriched downregulated gene list different fiber development stages (0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18dpa). Differentially expressed genes identified leaf fiber samples aligned cotton whole genome sequences combined genetic fine mapping results identify list candidate genes Li1.
