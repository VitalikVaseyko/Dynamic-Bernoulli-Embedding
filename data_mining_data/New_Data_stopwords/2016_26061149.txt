 Trypanosoma evansi, causes surra, descended Trypanosoma brucei brucei, causes nagana. Although parasites presumed metabolically similar, insufficient knowledge T. evansi precludes full comparison. Herein, provide first report subcellular localisation glycolytic enzymes T. evansi, alike bloodstream form (BSF) T. b. brucei: (i) fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase (glycolytic enzymes) glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (a glycolysis-auxiliary enzyme) glycosomes, (ii) enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase (glycolytic enzymes) GAPDH isoenzyme cytosol, (iii) malate dehydrogenase cytosol (iv) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glycosomes cytosol. Specific enzymatic activities also suggest T. evansi alike BSF T. b. brucei glycolytic flux, much faster pentose phosphate pathway flux, involvement cytosolic GAPDH NAD+/NADH balance. similarities expected based close phylogenetic relationship parasites.
