 AIMS: Protein S-glutathionylation widely distributed post-translational modification thiol groups glutathione function redox-sensitive switch mediate redox regulation signal transduction. malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exposed intense oxidative stress possesses enzymatic system required regulate protein S-glutathionylation, despite potential importance, protein S-glutathionylation yet studied malaria parasites. work applied method based enzymatic deglutathionylation, affinity purification biotin-maleimide-tagged proteins, proteomic analyses characterize Plasmodium glutathionylome. RESULTS: identified 493 targets protein S-glutathionylation Plasmodium. Functional profiles revealed targets components central metabolic pathways, nitrogen compound metabolism protein metabolism. Fifteen identified proteins important functions metabolic pathways (thioredoxin reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin peroxidase 1, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, plasmoredoxin, mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase 1, glyoxalase II, ornithine delta-aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH], pyruvate kinase [PK], phosphoglycerate mutase) analyzed study ability form mixed disulfides glutathione. demonstrate P. falciparum GAPDH, PK, ornithine delta-aminotransferase reversibly inhibited S-glutathionylation. Further, provide evidence P. falciparum glutaredoxin 1, also thioredoxin 1 plasmoredoxin able efficiently catalyze protein deglutathionylation. INNOVATION: used affinity-purification based proteomic approach characterize Plasmodium glutathionylome. CONCLUSION: results indicate wide regulative use S-glutathionylation malaria parasite contribute understanding redox-regulatory processes pathogen.
