 Fatty acid synthase over-expressed many cancers activity required cancer cell survival, role endogenously synthesized fatty acids cancer unknown. suggested endogenous fatty acid synthesis either needed support growth rapidly dividing cells, maintain elevated glycolysis (the Warburg effect) characteristic cancer cells. Here, investigate hypotheses. First, compared utilization fatty acids synthesized endogenously (14)C-labeled acetate supplied exogenously (14)C-labeled palmitate culture medium human breast cancer (MCF-7 MDA-MB-231) untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). found cancer cells produce fatty acids different derived exogenous palmitate, fatty acids esterified lipid phospholipid classes proportions, distribution within neutral lipids different untransformed cells. results suggest endogenously synthesized fatty acids fulfill specific function cancer cells. Furthermore, observed cancer cells excrete endogenously synthesized fatty acids, suggesting produced excess requirements. next investigated whether lipogenic activity involved maintenance high glycolytic activity culturing cancer non-transformed cells anoxic conditions. Although anoxia increased glycolysis 2-3 fold, observed concomitant increase lipogenesis. results indicate breast cancer cells specific qualitative quantitative requirement endogenously synthesized fatty acids increased de novo lipogenesis required sustain elevations glycolytic activity induced anoxia cells.
