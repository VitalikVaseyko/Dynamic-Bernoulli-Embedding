 fully understand glycolytic behavior cancer cells, important recognize linked pH dynamics. Here, evaluated acute effects mild acidification alkalization cancer cell glucose uptake glycolytic flux investigated role hexokinase (HK). Cancer cells exposed buffers graded pH measured 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, lactate production HK activity. Subcellular localization HK protein assessed western blots confocal microscopy. interior T47D breast cancer cells mildly alkalized pH 7.5 buffer pH 7.8, accompanied rapid increases FDG uptake lactate extrusion. shift toward glycolytic flux led prompt recovery reversed pH gradient. contrast, mild acidification rapidly reduced cellular FDG uptake lactate production. Mild acidification decreased mild alkalization increased mitochondrial HK translocation enzyme activity. Cells transfected specific siRNA HK-1, HK-2 voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)1 displayed significant attenuation pH-induced changes FDG uptake. Confocal microscopy showed increased co-localization HK-1 HK-2 VDAC1 alkaline treatment. isolated mitochondria, acidic pH increased alkaline pH decreased release free HK-1 HK-2 mitochondrial pellet supernatant. Furthermore, experiments using purified proteins showed alkaline pH promoted co-immunoprecipitation HK VDAC protein. findings demonstrate mild alkalization sufficient acutely trigger cancer cell glycolytic flux enhanced activity HK promoting mitochondrial translocation VDAC binding. process might serve mechanism cancer cells trigger Warburg effect maintain dysregulated pH.
