 Enhanced activation phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) hallmark many human tumors promotes cell proliferation survival several mechanisms. One mechanisms phosphorylation serine threonine kinase Akt cytosolic side plasma membrane phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), recruited activated binding phosphoinositides produced PI3K. previously demonstrated increased nuclear accumulation PDK1 cells enhanced PI3K activity. report nuclear PDK1 promoted cell proliferation suppressing FOXO3A-dependent transcription gene encoding p27Kip1 (an inhibitor cell cycle progression), whereas enhanced cell survival inhibiting activation c-Jun amino-terminal kinase. Cells nuclear-localized PDK1 showed anchorage-independent growth, injected mice, cells induced formation solid tumors. human prostate tumors, cytoplasmic localization PDK1 correlated early-stage, low-risk tumors, whereas nuclear PDK1 localization correlated high-risk tumors. Together, findings suggest role nuclear-translocated PDK1 oncogenic cellular transformation tumor progression mice humans.
