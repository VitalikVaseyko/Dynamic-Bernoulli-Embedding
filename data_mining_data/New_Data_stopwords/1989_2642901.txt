 Treatment dihydrolipoyl transacetylase-protein X-kinase subcomplex (E2-X-KcKb) protease Arg C selectively converted protein X inner domain fragment (Mr approximately equal 35,000) outer (lipoyl-bearing) domain fragment (Mr approximately equal 15,500). fragments larger much smaller, respectively, inner domain outer domain fragments derived E2 component, supporting conclusion protein X distinct E2 component. Protease Arg C cleaved Kb subunit slowly protein X. increase kinase activity correlated cleavage Kb subunits. even slower cleavage E2 subunits generated inner domain fragment (Mr approximately equal 31,500) lipoyl-bearing domain fragment (Mr approximately equal 49,000) Mr values least 3,000 10,000 larger, respectively, corresponding E2 fragments generated trypsin treatment subcomplex. Following various extents cleavage protease Arg C trypsin, residual oligomeric subcomplexes isolated characterized. found selective removal lipoyl-bearing domain protein X alter lipoyl-mediated regulation kinase indicating lipoyl residues bound E2 subunits effective, inner domain protein X remained associated inner domain E2 subunits following complete removal outer domains E2 protein X, that, 10% E2 subunits intact, nearly half catalytic (Kc) subunits kinase bound residual subcomplex, removal remaining outer domains E2 subunits released Kc subunits. Thus, protein X unique among subunits complex binding tightly oligomeric inner domain transacetylase, outer domain transacetylase serves bind facilitate regulation catalytic subunit kinase.
