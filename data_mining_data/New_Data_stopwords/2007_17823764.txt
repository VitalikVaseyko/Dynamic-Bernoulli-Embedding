 order clarify effect dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) improvement insulin resistance, examined effects overexpression wild-type protein kinase C-zeta (wt-PKCzeta)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (wt-PDK1) kinase-inactive PKCzeta/PDK1 (DeltaPKCzeta/DeltaPDK1) DHEA-induced [(3)H]2-deoxyglucose (DOG) uptake using electroporation method rat adipocytes. Overexpression wt-PKCzeta wt-PDK1 significantly increased DHEA-induced [(3)H]2-DOG uptake. Wortmannin completely suppressed DHEA-induced [(3)H]2-DOG uptake wt-PKCzeta- wt-PDK1-transfected adipocytes. Overexpression neither DeltaPKCzeta DeltaPDK1 increased DHEA-induced [(3)H]2-DOG uptake. Otsuka Long-Evans fatty rats (OLETF), animal models type 2 diabetes, Long-Evans Tokushima rats (LETO) control, treated 0.4% DHEA 2 weeks. Insulin-induced [(3)H]2-DOG uptakes, activations PI 3-kinase PKCzeta adipocytes significantly increased DHEA-treated OLETF rats. Moreover, plasma glucose levels OLETF rats treatment DHEA 2 weeks significantly lower treatment without DHEA, LETO rats. results indicate DHEA treatment may improve glucose tolerance PI 3-kinase-PKCzeta pathway downregulates adiposity OLETF rats.
