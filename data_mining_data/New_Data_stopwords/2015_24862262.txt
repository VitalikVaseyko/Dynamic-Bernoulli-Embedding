 increased flux glycolysis supports proliferation cancer cells providing additional energy form ATP well glucose-derived metabolic intermediates nucleotide, lipid, protein biosynthesis. Thus, glycolysis metabolic pathways control cell proliferation may represent valuable targets therapeutic interventions diagnostic procedures. context, measurement glucose uptake lactate excretion malignant cells may useful detect shifts glucose catabolism, determining activity rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes provide insights points metabolic regulation. Moreover, metabolomic studies used generate large, integrated datasets track changes carbon flux glycolysis collateral anabolic pathways. discussed here, approaches reveal quantify metabolic alterations underlie malignant cell proliferation.
