 OBJECTIVE: explore difference genes expression profiles focal cerebral ischemia tissue treated Baicalin using cDNA microarray. METHOD: total RNAs isolated rat brains sham-operation, vehicle (focal cerebral ischemia rat brain) baicalin-treated groups. mRNAs reversely transcribed cDNA incorporation fluorescent dUTP (Cy5 Cy3 dUTP) prepare hybridization probes. PCR products 4096 genes spotted chip serial treatment. mixed probes hybridized cDNA microarray. Axon Genepix 4000B GenePixPro 3.0 software used scan analyze fluorescent signals. RESULT: expressions 199 12 genes found up-regulated down-regulated, respectively, vehicle group compared sham-operation one. numbers genes whose expressions up-regulated down-regulated 89 88, respectively, comparing gene expression Baicalin-treated rat brain vehicle group. Moreover, one down-regulated three up-regulated genes vehicle group up-regulated down-regulated Baicalin-treated group, respectively. Expressions three up-regulated genes vehicle group reinforced Baicalin-treatment group. CONCLUSION: Multiple pathways nodes may involved pharmacological effect Baicalin brain ischemia.
