 BACKGROUND: Obtaining sufficient quantities recombinant M.tb proteins using traditional approaches often unsuccessful. Several enzymes glycolytic cycle known multifunctional, however relatively enzymes M.tb H37Rv characterized context enzymatic pleiotropic roles. One primary reasons difficulty obtaining sufficient amounts functionally active protein. RESULTS: current study, using M.tb glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) demonstrate expression E. coli M. smegmatis results insolubility improper subcellular localization. addition, expression conserved multisubunit proteins poses problem heteromerization host homologues. Importantly expression host dramatically affected yield functionality GAPDH terms enzymatic activity moonlighting function (transferrin binding). applicability system confirmed using two additional enzymes i.e. M.tb Pyruvate kinase Enolase. CONCLUSIONS: studies establish attenuated strain M.tb H37Ra suitable host expression highly hydrophobic, conserved, multimeric proteins M.tb H37Rv. Significantly, expression host overcomes limitations E. coli M. smegmatis expression yields recombinant protein qualitatively superior obtained traditional methods. current study highlights fact protein functionality (which essential requirement vitro assays drug development) may altered choice expression host.
