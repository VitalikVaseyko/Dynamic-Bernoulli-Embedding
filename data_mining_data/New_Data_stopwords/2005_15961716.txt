 Cardiac ischemia reperfusion associated loss activity mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Pharmacological stimulation PDH activity improves recovery contractile function reperfusion. Signaling mechanisms control inhibition reactivation PDH reperfusion therefore investigated. Using isolated rat heart model, observed ischemia-induced PDH inhibition partial recovery evident reperfusion. Translocation redox-sensitive delta-isoform protein kinase C (PKC) mitochondria occurred reperfusion. Inhibition process resulted full recovery PDH activity. Infusion deltaPKC activator H2O2 normoxic perfusion, mimic one aspect cardiac reperfusion, resulted loss PDH activity largely attributable translocation deltaPKC mitochondria. Evidence indicates reperfusion-induced translocation deltaPKC associated phosphorylation alphaE1 subunit PDH. potential mechanism provided vitro data demonstrating deltaPKC specifically interacts phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)2. Importantly, results activation PDK2, enzyme capable phosphorylating inhibiting PDH. Thus, translocation deltaPKC mitochondria reperfusion likely results activation PDK2 phosphorylation-dependent inhibition PDH.
