 Hydnocarpus alpina Wt. (Flacourtiaceae) (H. alpina) large tree traditionally used treat leprosy; also posses antidiabetic property. present study undertaken isolate, characterize evaluate antidiabetic effect 2R, 3R taxifolin 3-O-rhamnoside. (rhamnoside) impact carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes control streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes mellitus induced single intraperitoneal injection streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg). Oral administration rhamnoside 21 days significantly reduced food intake, calorie intake, blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin levels, improved plasma insulin levels. Administration rhamnoside showed significant increase body weight, body composition (Lean body weight (LBW) retro body fat), glycolytic hexokinase, glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase levels significant decrease observed levels glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase lactate dehydrogenase diabetic treated rats. Further, administration rhamnoside significantly improved glycogen content, glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase, suggesting antihyperglycemic potential rhamnoside diabetic rats. results obtained compared glibenclamide standard hypoglycaemic drug. Immunohistopathological study pancreas revealed increased number beta-cells insulin granules diabetes-induced rats treatment rhamnoside 21 days. Furthermore, Co-administration rhamnoside (50 mg/kg) nifedipine (13.6 mg/kg), Ca(2+)ion channel blocker, nicorandil (6.8 mg/kg), ATP-sensitive K(+) ion channel opener, reveals insulin secretion property rhamnoside via K(+)-ATP channels dependent pathway diabetic rats. conclusion, rhamnoside normalized blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, key hepatic enzymes glycogen content increasing insulin secretion via K(+)-ATP channels dependent signaling pathway. results suggest rhamnoside H. alpina could used therapeutic agent treat diabetes mellitus.
