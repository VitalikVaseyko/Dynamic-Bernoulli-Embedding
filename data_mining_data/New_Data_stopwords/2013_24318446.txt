 Cancer cells rely aerobic glycolysis maintain cell growth proliferation via Warburg effect. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHDGH) catalyzes first step serine biosynthetic pathway downstream glycolysis, metabolic gatekeeper macromolecular biosynthesis serine-dependent DNA synthesis. Here, report PHDGH overexpressed many ER-negative human breast cancer cell lines. PHGDH knockdown cells leads reduction serine synthesis impairment cancer cell proliferation. However, PHGDH knockdown affect tumor maintenance growth established breast cancer xenograft models, suggesting PHGDH-dependent cancer cell growth may context-dependent. findings suggest mechanisms pathways may bypass exclusive dependence PHGDH established human breast cancer xenografts, indicating PHGDH dispensable growth maintenance tumors vivo.
