 study tests hypothesis catecholamines regulate glucose availability hypoxia rainbow trout activating glycogen phosphorylase (GPase) inhibiting pyruvate kinase (PK) liver. net result would increase liver glycogenolysis reduction glycolysis and/or enhancement gluconeogenesis. used criteria Stalmans & (1975) report much lower resting percent GPase (active) values (20-30%) previously published. Dorsal aortic injections epinephrine norepinephrine increased plasma glucose (16-46%), effect liver muscle glycogen levels, decreased activity PK, increased total percent GPase activities. Pre-treatment beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol eliminated effects. moderate hypoxia, plasma glucose remained unchanged, lactate levels increased fourfold. fish pre-treated propranolol, hypoxia depressed plasma glucose levels (-26%), total percent GPase a, increased PK activity, suggesting hypoxia mediated dephosphorylation enzymes. conclude catecholamines stimulate hepatic beta-adrenoreceptors hypoxia sustain plasma glucose levels nullifying deleterious effects hypoxia metabolic function. specific metabolic consequences catecholamine-mediated effects increase activity active form GPase reduction PK activity, suggests activation glycogenolysis inhibition glycolysis and/or activation gluconeogenesis, respectively.
