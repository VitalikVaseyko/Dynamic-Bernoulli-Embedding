 bifunctional reagent 1,4-dibromobutanedione (DBBD) reacts covalently pyruvate kinase rabbit muscle cause inactivation enzyme rate linearly dependent reagent concentration, giving second order rate constant 444 min-1 M-1. individual substrates phosphoenolpyruvate (with KCl), ADP, ATP presence divalent metal cation provide marked protection inactivation suggesting reaction occurs region active site. limited incorporation DBBD pyruvate kinase measured reduction carbonyl groups enzyme-bound reagent using [3H]NaBH4. pyruvate kinase reacted 120 microM DBBD pH 7.0 50 min absence protectants, 1.8 mol tritium/mol subunit incorporated, whereas presence phosphoenolpyruvate KCl, 1.0 mol tritium incorporated per mole subunit. Modified peptides isolated tryptic digests pyruvate kinase. Reaction enzyme presence substrate (showing activity loss) yielded single peptide, Asn-Ile-X1-Lys, X1 corresponds Cys164 known amino acid sequence muscle pyruvate kinase. absence protectants, reaction 10 min (when enzyme retained substantial activity) yielded Asn-Ile-X1-Lys major labeled peptide, whereas reaction 50 min (when enzyme 88% inactivated) yielded predominantly Asn-Ile-X1-Lys cross-linked X2-Asp-Glu-Asn-Ile-Leu-Trp-Leu-Asp-Tyr-Lys, X2 corresponds Cys151. activity loss correlates appearance cross-linked peptides formation Asn-Ile-X1-Lys, inactivation likely caused reaction leading cross-link Cys151 Cys164. distance alpha-carbons residues crystal structure 15.5 A, whereas 12.0 spanned two side chains linked dioxobutyl group, suggesting either pyruvate kinase undergoes conformational change forming cross-link local rapid fluctuations structure occur solution extent 3.5 region pyruvate kinase.
