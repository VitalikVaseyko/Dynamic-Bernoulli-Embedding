 Four 8 definite heterozygous female carriers determined PCR amplification tandem CAG repeat AR gene, 4 families X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy (X-BSNP) showed extensive high amplitude motor unit potentials examined muscles although subjects neurologically normal. Plasma creatine kinase, myoglobin, myosin light chain, lactate pyruvate normal even carriers showed EMG abnormalities. Muscle biopsy showed type 2 fiber preponderance possible mild type 2 fiber grouping carrier EMG abnormality. results suggest mutant AR gene may express subclinical phenotypic manifestations subpopulation heterozygous females X-BSNP.
