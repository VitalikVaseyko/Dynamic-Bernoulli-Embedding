 Since Otto Warburg reported 'addiction' cancer cells fermentative glycolysis, metabolic pathway provides energy building blocks, thousands studies shed new light molecular mechanisms contributing altered cancer metabolism. Hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), addition oncogenes activation loss tumour suppressors constitute major regulators "Warburg effect" also many metabolic pathways glutaminolysis. Enhanced glucose glutamine catabolism become recognised feature cancer cells, leading accumulation metabolites tumour microenvironment, offers growth advantages tumours. Among metabolites, lactic acid, besides imposing acidic stress, emerging key signalling molecule plays pivotal role cancer cell migration, angiogenesis, immune escape metastasis. Although interest lactate cancer development appeared recently, pharmacological molecules blocking metabolism already phase I/II clinical trials. Here, review metabolic pathways generating lactate, discuss rationale targeting lactic acid transporter complexes development efficient selective anticancer therapies.
