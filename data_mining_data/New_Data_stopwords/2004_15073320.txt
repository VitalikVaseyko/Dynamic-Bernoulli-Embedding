 Lactococcus lactis strain NZ9000(pNZpyk), overproduces pyruvate kinase (PK), constructed. pNZpyk plasmid carries P(nisA)-pyk transcriptional fusion, overexpression pyk gene accomplished using nisin-inducible expression system NZ9000 strain. vivo (13)C- (31)P-NMR spectroscopy used evaluate effect modification metabolism glucose non-growing cells. detailed description kinetics glucose, end products, glycolytic intermediates, NAD(+) NADH obtained. 15-fold increase level PK increase overall glycolytic flux, which, contrary, slightly reduced. Significant differences observed (i) level 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), metabolites associated starvation; (ii) rate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) depletion upon glucose exhaustion; (iii) NAD(+)/NADH ratio glucose catabolism. mutant, rate FBP consumption glucose depletion notably accelerated anaerobic conditions, whereas 3-PGA PEP decreased undetectable levels. Furthermore, level NAD(+) decreased steadily utilization glucose, probably due unanticipated reduction lactate dehydrogenase activity comparison control strain, NZ9000(pNZ8020). results show PK important bottleneck carbon flux glucose becomes limiting; overproducer constriction longer present, evidenced faster FBP consumption lack accumulation 3-PGA PEP anaerobic well aerobic conditions. Despite clear changes, PK-overproducing strain showed typical homolactic metabolism anaerobic conditions, strain harbouring vector plasmid without pyk insert. However, oxygen atmosphere, increased channelling carbon production acetate acetoin, detriment lactate production.
