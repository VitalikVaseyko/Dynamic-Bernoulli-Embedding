 effect peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) capacitation rates cryopreserved bull spermatozoa participation protein kinases capacitation process evaluated. pool spermatozoa five bulls incubated Tyrode's albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) medium presence heparin (10 IU/ml), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 50 nM), nitric oxide donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 1-20 microM), ONOO(-) donor. participation ONOO(-) evaluated 15, 30 45 min confirmed using specific scavenger, uric acid (2-20 mM). Spermatozoa capacitated SIN-1 incubated ovarian follicular fluid cattle evaluate ability undergo acrosome reaction. role ONOO(-) capacitation induced heparin nitric oxide evaluated addition uric acid. participation protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC) protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) capacitation induced ONOO(-) evaluated incubation specific inhibitors (50 microM H-89, 0.1 microM bisindolylmaleimide I, 3 microM genistein, respectively). Capacitation percentages determined fluorescence technique chlortetracycline (CTC) true acrosome reaction determined trypan blue Differential-Interferential Contrast (DIC). SIN-1 concentrations employed effect progressive motility sperm viability. Capacitation values 10 microM SIN-1 treatment (23+/-2%) significantly greater respect control (4.6+/-1.62%). 15 min incubation greatest capacitation observed (P<0.05), reaching plateau 15 45 min. Follicular fluid induced acrosome reaction spermatozoa previously capacitated 10 microM SIN-1 (P<0.05). Uric acid prevented SIN-1-induced capacitation significantly diminished capacitation induced heparin SNP. addition PKA PKC inhibitors failed modify capacitation induced SIN-1 (27.4+/-3.85 24.8+/-4.75, respectively). Genistein, PTK inhibitor, produced significant capacitation decrease (8.6+/-5.5%). results indicate endogenous ONOO(-) may generated heparin- SNP-induced capacitation. Exogenous ONOO(-) acts capacitation inducer involves participation PTK, part intracellular mechanisms lead capacitation cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa.
