 Glucagon caused marked decrease total L-pyruvate kinase activity control hepatocytes maintained monolayer culture (t1/2 = 54 h), addition insulin hepatocytes isolated fasted rat caused four- fivefold increase total enzyme activity. Maintenance L-pyruvate kinase control cultures hepatocytes shown require insulin. However, 1 microM glucagon present medium, total L-pyruvate kinase activity maintained even presence 1 microM insulin, rather total L-pyruvate kinase activity cells steadily declined 12.1 5.7 units/mg DNA 6th day culture. increase total L-pyruvate kinase activity fasted hepatocytes cultured presence insulin shown result increase protein synthesis, since actinomycin cycloheximide blocked insulin-induced increase enzyme activity. addition 1 microM glucagon cultures fasted hepatocytes also blocked insulin-induced increase total L-pyruvate kinase activity. Since glucagon decreased total L-pyruvate kinase activity control hepatocytes blocked increase L-pyruvate kinase activity fasted hepatocytes, suggested that, addition phosphorylation L-pyruvate kinase cAMP-dependent protein kinase, glucagon also acts decrease synthesis L-pyruvate kinase vitro.
