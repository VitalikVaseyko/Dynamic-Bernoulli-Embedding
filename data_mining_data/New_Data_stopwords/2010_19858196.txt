 catabolic pathway branched-chain amino acids includes deamination followed oxidative decarboxylation deaminated product branched-chain alpha-keto acids, catalyzed mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm) branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex (BCKDC). found BCATm binds E1 decarboxylase BCKDC, forming metabolon allows channeling branched-chain alpha-keto acids BCATm E1. protein complex also contains glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH1), 4-nitrophenylphosphatase domain non-neuronal SNAP25-like protein homolog 1, pyruvate carboxylase, BCKDC kinase. GDH1 binds pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) form BCATm (PMP-BCATm) pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-BCATm metabolon proteins. Leucine activates GDH1, oxidative deamination glutamate increased addition PMP-BCATm. Isoleucine valine allosteric activators GDH1, presence 5'-phosphate-BCATm, convert BCATm PMP-BCATm, stimulating GDH1 activity. Sensitivity ADP activation GDH1 unaffected PMP-BCATm; however, addition 3 higher molar ratio PMP-BCATm GDH1 protected GDH1 GTP inhibition 50%. Kinetic results suggest GDH1 facilitates regeneration form BCATm binds E1 decarboxylase BCKDC, promotes metabolon formation, branched-chain amino acid oxidation, cycling nitrogen glutamate.
