 OBJECTIVE: measure changes rectal temperature hematologic, biochemical, blood gas, acid-base values exercise. ANIMALS: 14 healthy adult Labrador Retrievers. PROCEDURE: Dogs exercised continuously 10 minutes repeatedly retrieving dummy thrown approximately 40 50 yards land. ambient temperature exercise period recorded. Rectal temperature, pulse, respiratory rate measured; CBC serum biochemical profile determined; arterial blood gas tensions, acid-base status, plasma lactate pyruvate concentrations measured rest immediately exercise. Rectal temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, lactate pyruvate concentrations evaluated intervals 120 minutes exercise. RESULTS: Immediately exercise, rectal temperature increased markedly; ambient temperature affect rectal temperature. Arterial blood pH PaO2 significantly increased exercise, PaCO2 bicarbonate concentration significantly decreased exercise. Also, statistically, clinically, significant increases observed RBC, WBC, segmented neutrophil counts; hemoglobin, total protein, serum sodium potassium concentrations; PCV; anion gap; creatine kinase activity. Plasma lactate pyruvate concentrations increased significantly exercise, change lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. CONCLUSION CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Reference values healthy Laborador Retrievers standardized exercise protocol established compare data obtained Laborador Retrievers exercise intolerance collapse. Important characteristics lactate pyruvate metabolism documented enable precise evaluation exercise intolerance breed.
