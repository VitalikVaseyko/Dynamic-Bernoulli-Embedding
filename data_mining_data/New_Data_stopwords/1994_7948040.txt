 Myocardial contractile performance function sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ uptake release. Ca2+ handling ATP-dependent account 40% total myocardial energy expenditure. tested hypothesis thermodynamics cytosolic adenylate system modulate sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ handling hence function intact heart. Cellular energy level experimentally manipulated perfusing isolated working guinea-pig hearts substrate-free medium media fortified lactate and/or pyruvate main energy substrate. Left ventricular contractile function judged stroke work intraventricular dP/dt. Cytosolic energy level indexed measured creatinine kinase reactants. Relative 5 mM lactate, 5 mM pyruvate increased left ventricular stroke work, dP/dtmax, dP/dtmin, lowering left ventricular end-diastolic pressure physiological left atrial aortic pressures. Pyruvate also doubled cytosolic phosphorylation potentials increased [ATP]/[ADP] ratio; energetic enhancement distinguishes pyruvate inotropic stimulation catecholamines, known decrease cytosolic energy level perfused heart. Sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ handling assessed hearts prelabeled 45Ca, subjected 45Ca washout presence different cytosolic energy levels, stimulated 10 mM caffeine release residual sarcoplasmic reticular 45Ca. ryanodine (1 microM) applied open Ca2+ channels thereby released 45Ca sarcoplasmic reticulum washout, caffeine-stimulated 45Ca release decreased 96%, demonstrating virtually entire caffeine-sensitive 45Ca pool located sarcoplasmic reticulum. detailed comparisons pyruvate-energized vs. substrate-free deenergized hearts, inverse relationship cytosolic energy level caffeine-mobilized 45Ca pool size observed. Thus, caffeine-induced 45Ca release decreased 60% pyruvate energization increased 2.5-fold substrate-free deenergization. Taken together, results support hypothesis enhancement myocardial inotropism energy-yielding substrate mediated increased sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ loading/release. Thus propose known control sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ turnover protein kinase/phospholamban system modulated cytosolic energy level.
