 photosensitizing activity hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) investigated studying selected enzymes localized mitochondria cytosol R3230AC mammary adenocarcinomas. Experiments vitro demonstrated mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase inhibited drug dose- light exposure time-related manner; 7.0 micrograms HPD per ml higher, enzyme activity inhibited greater 50% 15 min photoradiation. three cytosol enzymes studied conditions vitro demonstrated different photosensitivities. Pyruvate kinase activity significantly inhibited dose- time-related fashion, whereas lactate dehydrogenase inhibited lesser extent, glucose phosphate isomerase activity inhibited highest dose (70 micrograms HPD per ml) used. time-course responses examined vivo-in vitro protocol, consisting photoradiation mitochondria cytosol prepared tumors obtained various times (up 1 week) single injection HPD (80 mg/kg). Pyruvate kinase activity markedly inhibited early times returning initial levels 48 hr; neither lactate dehydrogenase glucose phosphate isomerase inhibited treatment. Mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome c oxidase activities displayed significant photoradiation-induced inhibitions, greatest inhibition occurring 24 96 hr injection HPD; 1 week, succinate dehydrogenase activity returned initial level, cytochrome c oxidase activity remained significantly inhibited. data suggest HPD-induced photosensitization mitochondria may important site action contributing tumor cell cytotoxicity regression result photoradiation therapy.
