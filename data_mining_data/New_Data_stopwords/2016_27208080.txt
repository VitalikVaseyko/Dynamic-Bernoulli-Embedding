 Millions people worldwide chronically exposed arsenic contaminated drinking water. Despite decades research studying carcinogenic potential arsenic, mechanisms arsenic causes cancer diseases remain poorly understood. Mitochondria appear important target arsenic toxicity. trivalent arsenical, arsenite, induce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, inhibit enzymes involved energy metabolism, induce aerobic glycolysis vitro, suggesting metabolic dysfunction may important arsenic-induced disease. Here, using model organism Caenorhabditis elegans novel metabolic inhibition assay, report vivo induction aerobic glycolysis following arsenite exposure. Furthermore, arsenite exposure induced severe mitochondrial dysfunction, including altered pyruvate metabolism; reduced steady-state ATP levels, ATP-linked respiration spare respiratory capacity; increased proton leak. also found evidence induction autophagy important protective response arsenite exposure. results demonstrate mitochondria important vivo target arsenite toxicity, hypothesized deficiencies mitochondrial electron transport chain genes, cause mitochondrial disease humans, would sensitize nematodes arsenite. agreement this, nematodes deficient electron transport chain complexes I, II, III, ATP synthase, sensitive arsenite exposure, thus identifying novel class gene-environment interactions warrant investigation human populace.
