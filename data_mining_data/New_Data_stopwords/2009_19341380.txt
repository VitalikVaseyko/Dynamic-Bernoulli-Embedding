 Maintenance adaptation energy metabolism could play important role cellular ability respond DNA damage. large number studies suggest sensitivity cells oxidants oxidative stress depends activity cellular metabolism dependent glucose concentration. fact, yeast cells utilize fermentative carbon sources hence rely mainly glycolysis energy appear sensitive oxidative stress. show treatment yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing glucose-rich medium DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) triggers rapid inhibition respiration enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, accompanied strong suppression glycolysis. Further, diminished activity pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase upon MMS treatment leads diversion glucose carbon glycerol, trehalose glycogen accumulation increased flux pentose-phosphate pathway. conditions finally result significant decline ATP level energy charge. effects dependent glucose concentration medium. results clearly demonstrate calorie restriction reduces MMS toxicity increased respiration reduced ROS accumulation, enhancing survival recovery cells.
