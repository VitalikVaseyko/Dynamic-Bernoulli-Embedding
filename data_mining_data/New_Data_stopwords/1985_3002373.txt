 potent, heat-stable protein inhibitor branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase identified purified near homogeneity bovine kidney mitochondria (Damuni, Z., Humphreys, J. S., Reed, L. J., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., press). protein noncompetitive inhibitor BCKDH phosphatase, Ki 0.13 nM. contrast, protein inhibitor affect activity cytosolic protein phosphatase-1 phosphatase-2A mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase concentrations 10 nM. cytosolic protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 inhibitor-2 effect activity BCKDH phosphatase PDH phosphatase concentrations 50 300 nM respectively. results, together previous evidence, demonstrate BCKDH phosphatase inhibitor protein distinct cytosolic protein phosphatase-1 phosphatase-2A protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 inhibitor-2, respectively.
