 Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) widely prescribed screening test colorectal cancer (CRC) simple, non-invasive, demonstrated reduces mortality due colorectal carcinomas (CRC). However, guaiac based fecal blood tests (gFOBT) suffer poor sensitivity, particularly respect detecting early stages, well low acceptance among population. Preliminary data detection fecal proteins like calprotectin tumour-M2-PK indicated might better performance characteristics gFOBTs. However, tests also suffer low sensitivity poor specificity especially detecting early lesions. Recently developed immunological tests (iFOBT) demonstrate significantly higher sensitivity specificity. iFOBTs use antibodies specific human hemoglobulin therefore affected necessity dietary drug restrictions otherwise limit use gFOBTs. present iFOBTs seem cost-effective approach non-invasive CRC screening. analysis fecal DNA represents emerging new field early detection colorectal neoplasia. Small trials multitarget assays demonstrated sensitivity CRC 62 91% sensitivity adenomas 26 73%. specificity assays high ranging 93 100%. major drawback fecal DNA testing, compared fecal colorectal cancer screening tests, unacceptable high cost.
