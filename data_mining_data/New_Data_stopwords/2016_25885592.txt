 BACKGROUND: assess pathological correlations temporal trends Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) M2 Pyruvate kinase (TuM2PK), markers tumor vascular development metabolism, patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: prospectively collected plasma samples 89 patients underwent surgical/ablative therapy RCC 38 patients benign disease (nephrolithiasis, hematuria without apparent neoplastic origin, renal cysts). RCC patients, marker levels compared least 1 preoperative 1 postoperative time point generally 3 weeks surgery. Marker temporal trends assessed using Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Plasma VEGF, ANGPT2, TuM2PK levels determined ELISA tested association pathological variables. RESULTS: Median age comparable groups. 83/89 (93%) cohort underwent surgical extirpation. 82% tumors organ confined (T </= 2, N0). ANGPT2 exhibited significantly elevated preoperative levels patients RCC compared benign disease (p = 0.046). Elevated preoperative levels ANGPT2 TuM2PK significantly correlated increased tumor size advanced grade (p < 0.05). Chromophobe RCC exhibited higher levels ANGPT2 compared histologies (p < 0.05). decline marker level surgery observed, likely due timing analyses. CONCLUSION: results suggest ANGPT2 marker RCC. Additionally, ANGPT2 TuM2PK significantly correlated several adverse pathological features. studies needed determine clinical applicability.
