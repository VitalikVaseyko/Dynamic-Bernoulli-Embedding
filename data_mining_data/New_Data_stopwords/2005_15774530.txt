 5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR), pharmacological activator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acutely stimulates glucose uptake fatty acid (FA) oxidation skeletal muscle. However, fully understood whether AICAR-induced changes glucose oxidation secondary changes FA oxidation (i.e. glucose fatty acid cycle), role AMPK may playing regulation intramuscular triacylglycerol (TAG) esterification hydrolysis. examined acute (60 min) effects AICAR (2 mm) FA metabolism, glucose oxidation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activation isolated resting rat soleus muscle strips exposed two different FA concentrations (low fatty acid, LFA, 0.2 mm; high fatty acid, HFA, 1 mm). AICAR significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity (+192%; P<0.05) 60 min, simultaneously increased FA (LFA: +33%, P<0.05; HFA: +36%, P<0.05) glucose (LFA: +105%, P<0.05; HFA: +170, P<0.001) oxidation regardless FA availability. changes TAG esterification, AICAR increase ratio FA partitioned oxidation relative TAG esterification (LFA: +15%, P<0.05; HFA: +49%, P<0.05). AICAR effect endogenous TAG hydrolysis oxidation resting soleus. stimulation glucose oxidation AICAR associated increase PDH activation (+126%; P<0.05) without effect pyruvate, allosteric activator PDH complex, suggesting AMPK may stimulate PDH directly. conclusion, AMPK appears important regulator FA metabolism glucose oxidation resting skeletal muscle.
