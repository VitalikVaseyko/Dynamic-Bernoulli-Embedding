 Alloreactive donor cells driving force induction graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), yet little known cell metabolism response alloantigens hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Here, demonstrated donor cells undergo metabolic reprograming allogeneic HCT. Specifically, employed murine allogeneic BM transplant model determined cells switch fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) pyruvate oxidation via tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle aerobic glycolysis, thereby increasing dependence upon glutaminolysis pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis required optimal function alloantigen-activated cells induction GVHD, inhibition glycolysis targeting mTORC1 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) ameliorated GVHD mortality morbidity. Together, results indicate donor cells use glycolysis predominant metabolic process allogeneic HCT suggest glycolysis potential therapeutic target control GVHD.
