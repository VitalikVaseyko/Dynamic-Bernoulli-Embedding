 BACKGROUND: Lactate levels within tumors correlated metastases, tumor recurrence, radioresistance, thus apparently contributing poor outcomes patients various cancers. previously reported high-level production lactate multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines associated high-level LDH activity within MM cells. However, kinetics lactate remains studied. present study, attempted elucidate mechanism lactate incorporation MM cells. METHODS: Six MM cell lines stromal cells obtained long-term culture bone marrow samples MM patients employed. Incorporation lactate quantified using C(14)-labeled lactate. role MCT1, member monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), expressed MM cells, examined presence inhibitor (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid: CHC) using gene-silencing technique. RESULTS: MM cell lines well stromal cells found produce lactate. Incorporation C(14)-labeled lactate MM cells occurred 6 MM cell lines analyzed. Inhibition MCT1 using CHC MCT1-targeting siRNA reduced lactate incorporation caused apoptosis MM cells. apoptosis enhanced activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase blocked dichroloacetate. Survival normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells influenced MCT1 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: present data suggest lactate produced MM cell lines stromal cells, contributes survival MM cells autocrine paracrine manners. Suppression lactate incorporation targeting MCT1 may provide novel therapeutic strategy MM may applicable B-cell neoplasms.
