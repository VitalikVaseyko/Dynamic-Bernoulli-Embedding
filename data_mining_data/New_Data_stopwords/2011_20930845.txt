 Maternal effect factors derived oocytes important sustaining early embryonic development major wave embryonic genome activation (EGA). study, report two-cell-stage arrest embryos lacking maternal 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 result suppressed EGA. Concurrent deletion maternal Pten completely rescued suppressed EGA embryonic progression restored AKT signalling, fully restored fertility double-mutant females. study identifies maternal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling new maternal effect factor regulates EGA preimplantation embryogenesis mice.
