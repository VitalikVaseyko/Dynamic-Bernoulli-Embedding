 Myocardial substrate metabolism enzyme release following hypothermic potassium cardioplegia studied two series patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. 15 patients blood used cardioplegia vehicle (blood cardioplegia group) plain electrolyte solution used control group 17 patients. Simultaneous blood samples drawn arterial coronary sinus blood first 60 min release aortic cross-clamping. Blood samples analyzed PO2. O2-saturation content, PCO2, pH, lactate, pyruvate, glucose, potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), isoenzyme MB aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). addition, myoglobin enzymes followed peripheral venous blood 48 hours. pattern metabolic changes cardioplegia similar groups, differences encountered degree changes potassium, myoglobin CK-MB groups. differences nevertheless small cell damage probably reversible nature patients, myocardial protection afforded single dose blood cardioplegia unquestionably better control group.
