 Cadmium, addition producing variety toxic manifestations, known accumulate certain "target" organs include liver kidney histological functional damage becomes apparent. daily intraperitoneal injection cadmium chloride 21 45 days stimulated activities hepatic pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1, 6-diphosphatase glucose-6-phosphatase elevated blood glucose urea, lowered hepatic glycogen rats. Whereas chronic Cd treatment failed alter adenosine-3', 5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, cyclic AMP (cAMY activity basal fluoride-stimulated forms hepatic adenylate cyclase (AC) markedly increased. However, cAMP binding hepatic protein kinase decreased kinase activity ration. acute dose Cd decreased hepatic glycogen content increased blood glucose, serum urea, hepatic cAMP. Chronic exposure Cd induced adrenal hypertrophy augmented adrenal norepinephrine epinephrine well activity adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase. treatment decreased prostatic testicular weights mature rats. Although cAMP well AC activity prostate gland reduced, cAMP binding prostatic protein kinase increased activity cAMP-dependent form enzyme. Testicular AC PDE activities, however, stimulated, although cAMP remained unaffected. Whereas activities cAMP-dependent independent forms testicular protein kinase significantly depressed, binding cAMP protein kinase testes Cd-treated rats affected. cases, observed metabolic alterations persisted 28 days cessation Cd administration. Subacute Cd treatment suppressed pancreatic function evidenced lowered serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI) presence hyperglycemia, well partial inhibition phentolamine-stimulated increases serum IRI. Although chronic Cd treatment failed alter concentration brain stem norepinephrine cerebrocortical acetylcholine esterase activity, serotonin levels brain stem depressed concentration striatal dopamine cerebrocortical acetylcholine significantly elevated compared values seen control nonexposed animals.
