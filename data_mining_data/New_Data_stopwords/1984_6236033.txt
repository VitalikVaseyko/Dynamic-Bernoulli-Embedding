 glycolytic process non-infected A. marginale-infected bovine erythrocytes studied. study included four enzymes: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvic kinase lactic dehydrogenase, intracellular concentrations glucose, ATP 2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG). activities phosphofructokinase lactic dehydrogenase found non-infected bovine erythrocytes fifty times greater previously reported values. Glucose DPG concentrations, hexokinase, pyruvic kinase lactic dehydrogenase specific activities change significantly experimental anaplasmosis. Phosphofructokinase activity A. marginale-infected erythrocytes increased values 300% found intact bovine red cells. ATP concentration infected erythrocytes decreased values 40% found non-infected cells: 1.60 +/- 0.40 0.70 +/- 0.08 mumole per gram hemoglobin.
