 2-Demethoxy-2,3-ethylenediamino hypocrellin B (EDAHB) efficient photosensitizer mediates cancer cell apoptosis. order better understand molecular mechanisms involved antitumour activity, used proteomics technology identify candidate targets A549 cells using EDAHB-mediated photodynamic therapy (EDAHB-PDT). protein profile changes untreated PDT-treated A549 cells analysed using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Differentially expressed protein spots identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry; 15 differentially expressed proteins (over 2-fold, p<0.05) identified PDT-treated A549 cells compared untreated cells. Among them, expression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key enzyme involved glycolysis, found significantly decreased A549 cells following EDAHB-PDT. Transient ectopic over-expression PKM2 attenuated death EDAHB-PDT-treated A549 cells, whereas knockdown PKM2 expression RNA interference increased photocytotoxicity EDAHB. Moreover, decrease lactate production detected PDT-treated A549 cells. observations suggest PKM2 plays important role antitumour action EDAHB-PDT; thus, may potential molecular target increase efficacy PDT cancer therapy.
