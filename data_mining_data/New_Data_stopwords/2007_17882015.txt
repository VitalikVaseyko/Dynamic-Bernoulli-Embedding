 Degenerative diseases abnormal protein aggregates characterized accumulation proteins variable posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, glycoxidation, oxidation, nitration. Myofibrillar myopathies, including myotilinopathies desminopathies, characterized intracytoplasmic focal accumulation proteins insoluble aggregates muscle cells. using single immunohistochemistry, monodimensional gel electrophoresis Western blotting, bidimensional gel electrophoresis, in-gel digestion, mass spectometry, desmin demonstrated major target oxidation nitration desminopathies myotilinopathies. oxidized nitrated proteins may toxic effects may impair ubiquitin-proteasomal function, modified desmin considered additional element pathogenesis myofibrillar myopathies. addition desmin, pyruvate kinase muscle splice form M1 oxidized, thus supporting complemental mitochondrial damage, least cases myotilinopathy.
