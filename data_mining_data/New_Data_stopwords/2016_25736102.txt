 study aims determine effects exercise training carbohydrate lipid catabolism swimming muscles Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) measuring levels related enzymes, lipids free fatty acids. designed one control group two training groups fish exercised different training intensities [0, 1 1.5 body lengths per second (bl/s)]. fish experimental groups trained 12 h/day 4 weeks. Compared control group, 1 1.5 bl/s groups showed significantly increased hexokinase pyruvate kinase activities red muscle (p < 0.05). white muscle, pyruvate kinase activity significantly higher 1.5 bl/s group control group (p < 0.05), hexokinase activity significantly differ groups. activities hormone-sensitive lipase carnitine palmitoyltransferase muscle types significantly lower training groups control group (p < 0.05). plasma-free fatty acid level decreased (p < 0.05), lipid percentages increased red muscle (p < 0.05) exercise training. findings clearly indicated exercise training, glycolysis increased lipid oxidation decreased swimming muscle tilapia.
