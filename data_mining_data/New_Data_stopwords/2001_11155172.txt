 Pathways amino acid metabolism Prevotella intermedia Prevotella nigrescens investigated. Prevotella strains grew anaerobically tryptone-based medium growth increased upon addition aspartate medium. Washed cells tryptone-grown strains metabolized aspartate succinate, acetate, fumarate, malate, formate ammonia, tryptone produced isobutyrate isovalerate addition end products aspartate. Cell extracts obtained tryptone-grown cells aspartate ammonia-lyase conversion aspartate fumarate. Methylviologen-dependent fumarate reductase found reduce fumarate succinate. series enzymatic activities, including fumarase, NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, methylviologen-dependent pyruvate oxidoreductase, phosphotransacetylase acetate kinase, detected oxidative conversion fumarate acetate. Pyruvate formate-lyase NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase also found production consumption formate, respectively. Methylviologen: NAD(P) oxidoreductase found responsible linkage reductive oxidative pathways. Furthermore, cell extracts branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase methylviologen-dependent branched-chain 2-oxoacid oxidoreductase, concomitantly NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase. Valine leucine could converted isobutyryl CoA isovaleryl CoA, respectively, sequential catalyses enzymes, consequently isobutyrate isovalerate, respectively.
