 Background: Current noninvasive methods assessing intestinal inflammation inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unsatisfactory. Along C-reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) standard test assessing IBD activity, even though specificity accuracy optimal lacks validated cutoff. past decades, several fecal markers released intestinal inflammatory cells investigated IBD; subject systematic review. Methods: systematic electronic search English literature April 2017 performed using Medline Cochrane Library. papers written English analyzed fecal biomarkers IBD included. vitro studies, animal studies, studies blood/serum samples, studies analyzing FC fecal lactoferrin alone excluded. Results: 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies identified. Data grouped according fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, M2-pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, beta-glucuronidase. markers showed high sensitivity specificity correlated disease activity, response therapy, mucosal healing. Furthermore, showed potential utility prediction clinical relapse. Conclusions: Several fecal biomarkers potential become useful tools complementing FC IBD diagnosis monitoring. However, wide variability accuracy assessment intestinal inflammation suggests need studies.
