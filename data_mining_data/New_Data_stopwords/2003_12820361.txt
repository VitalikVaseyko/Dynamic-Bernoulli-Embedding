 Circulating Tumor M2-PK serum levels measured 118 patients various haematological malignancies. Using 17.5 U/ml cut-off level, elevated Tumor M2-PK concentrations found 7 35 patients acute myelocytic leukaemia, 17 38 patients chronic myelocytic leukaemia, 5 18 patients chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 6 14 patients acute lymphocytic leukaemia. 9 195 healthy control individuals Tumor M2-PK plasma levels 17.5 U/ml. Serial determinations Tumor M2-PK performed 3 patients haematological malignancies chemotherapy. Disease regression associated alternating Tumor M2-PK plasma levels. Thus, Tumor M2-PK useful indicator haematological malignancies. Moreover, serial Tumor M2-PK measurement may insignificant monitoring response chemotherapy patients.
