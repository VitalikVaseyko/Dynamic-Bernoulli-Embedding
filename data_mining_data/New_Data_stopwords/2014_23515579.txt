 Pyruvate kinase, muscle type 2 (PKM2), key factor aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. experiments, liver cancer cell lines exhibited range sensitivity PKM2 knockdown-mediated growth inhibition. speculated differential sensitivity attributable variable dependency glycolysis growth different cell lines. Transcriptome data revealed overexpression glucose transporter (GLUT3) lactate transporter (MCT4) genes PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells. PKM2 knockdown-resistant cells expressed high levels lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) genes. Concordant gene expression results, PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells generated high levels lactate. addition, ATP production significantly reduced PKM2 knockdown-sensitive cells treated glucose analog, indicative dependency cellular energetics lactate-producing glycolysis. PKM2 knockdown-resistant cells subdivided less glycolytic (glycolysis branch pathway-dependent) glycolytic groups. findings collectively support utility PKM2 therapeutic target high lactate-producing glycolytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
