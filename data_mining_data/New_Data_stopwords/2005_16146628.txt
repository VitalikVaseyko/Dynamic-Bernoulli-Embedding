 homeodomain protein Hex function either transcriptional repressor activator animals. Recent reports indicated Hex involved liver development. However, target genes interacting proteins largely unknown. found Hex functionally interacted hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha stimulate activity using reporter gene containing multiple copies HNF1alpha-binding site L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene promoter natural L-PK promoter. stimulation required homeodomain acidic carboxyl-terminal region Hex. Over-expression Hex primary cultured hepatocytes resulted stimulation L-PK gene expression. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay co-immunoprecipitation revealed Hex physically interacted HNF1alpha mammalian cells homeodomain Hex POU-homeodomain HNF1alpha. Since HNF1alpha important liver-enriched transcription factor involved liver differentiation, Hex may contribute liver differentiation interaction HNF1alpha.
