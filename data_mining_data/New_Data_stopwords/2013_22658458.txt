 BACKGROUND: Currently reliable technique predicting clinical pathologic complete tumor response radiochemotherapy (RCT) patients rectal cancer. applied reverse phase protein microarray (RPMA) technology find signal pathway may predict response preoperative treatment. PATIENTS METHODS: Fifteen rectal cancer samples collected preoperative RCT. Seven patients good response preoperative therapy (Mandard grade I-II) 8 patients poor response (Mandard grade III-V). Using laser capture microdissection (LCM) RPMA analysis, measured phosphorylation level nearly 80 end points analyzed signaling pathways. RESULTS: identified 4 signaling proteins whose phosphorylation levels significantly different (P < .05) good vs. poor responders; CHK2 beta-catenin highly phosphorylated poor responders, whereas PDK1 glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3alpha/beta lower phosphorylation levels poor responders. Interestingly GSK-3alpha/beta, beta-catenin, PDK1 present phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Based results, hypothesize activating state PI3K-AKT pathway stratify patients could benefit neoadjuvant treatment. Moreover, identification theranostic targets potential pinpoint new therapeutic strategies nonresponsive population.
