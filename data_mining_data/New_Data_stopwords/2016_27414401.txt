 Silibinin, major bioactive flavonolignan Silybum marianum, received considerable attention view anticarcinogenic activity. present study examines anticancer potential 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced skin cancer. Male LACA mice randomly segregated 4 groups: Control, DMBA/TPA, Silibinin Silibinin+DMBA/TPA. Tumors DMBA/TPA Silibinin+DMBA/TPA groups histologically graded squamous cell carcinoma. Silibinin+DMBA/TPA group, significant reduction tumor incidence (23%), tumor volume (64.4%), tumor burden (84.8%) observed compared DMBA/TPA group. underlying protective mechanism Silibinin action studied pre-initiation (2 weeks), post-initiation (10 weeks) promotion (22 weeks) stages skin carcinogenesis. antioxidant nature Silibinin evident end 2 weeks treatment. However, towards end 10 22 weeks, elevated lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels indicate pro-oxidative nature Silibinin cancerous tissue. TUNEL assay revealed enhanced apoptosis Silibinin+DMBA/TPA group respect DMBA/TPA group. Therefore, may suggested raised LPO could responsible triggering apoptosis Silibinin+DMBA/TPA group. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used determine metabolic profile skin /skin tumors. Dimethylamine (DMA), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), glucose, lactic acid, taurine guanine identified major contributors separation groups Principal Component Analysis (PCA) metabolite data. Enhanced DMA levels alteration GPC, glucose lactate levels reflect altered choline metabolism marked Warburg effect skin tumors. However, elevated guanine levels potent suppression taurine glucose levels Silibinin+DMBA/TPA group suggestive pro-oxidative nature Silibinin regressing tumors. Thus, supporting theory augmented LPO levels resulting increased apoptosis skin tumors treated Silibinin.
