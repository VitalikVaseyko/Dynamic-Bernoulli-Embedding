 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), intracellular metabolite glycolytic pathway known affect oxygen binding capacity haemoglobin mechanical properties red blood cells. 2,3-DPG levels reported elevated anaemic conditions including visceral leishmaniasis. 2,3-DPG activity P. falciparum infected red blood cells, particularly cells infected different stages parasite relationship structural integrity cells known. Chloroquine sensitive resistant strains P. falciparum cultured vitro synchronized cultures ring, trophozoite schizont stage rich cells along uninfected control erythrocytes assayed 2,3-DPG activity osmotic fragility. observed strains, infected erythrocytes 2,3-DPG activity gradually decreased osmotic fragility gradually increased parasite matured ring schizont stage. decrease 2,3-DPG may probably due increased pyruvate kinase activity parasite origin, shown erythrocytes infected several species Plasmodium. absence compensatory increase 2,3-DPG P. falciparum infected erythrocytes may aggravate hypoxia due anaemia malaria probably may contribute hypoxia cerebral malaria. 2,3-DPG found increased erythrocytes parasitized P. falciparum, increased osmotic fragility observed cells due increased 2,3-DPG suggested visceral leishmaniasis.
