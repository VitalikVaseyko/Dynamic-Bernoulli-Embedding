 AIMS: Sodium nitrite used inhibit growth microorganisms responsible desirable red color meat; however, toxic high quantities humans animals. Moreover, glycogen, branched polysaccharide, efficiently stores releases glucose monosaccharides accessible metabolic synthetic requirements cell. Therefore, examined impact dietary sodium nitrite cod liver oil liver glycogen. MAIN METHODS: Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats treated daily sodium nitrite (80 mg/kg) presence/absence cod liver oil (5 ml/kg). Liver sections stained Periodic acid-Schiff. Hepatic homogenates used measurements glycogen, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase (PKA), glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphodiesterase glycogen phosphorylase. Glucose, pyruvate tolerances HOMA insulin resistance also determined. KEY FINDINGS: Sodium nitrite significantly increased plasma glucose insulin resistance. Moreover, sodium nitrite significantly reduced hepatic glycogen content well activities glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, phosphodiesterase. Sodium nitrite elevated hepatic cAMP, PKA, pyruvate carboxylase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase phosphorylase. Cod liver oil significantly blocked except pyruvate carboxylase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase glucose 6-phosphatase. SIGNIFICANCE: Sodium nitrite inhibited liver glycogenesis enhanced liver glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis, accompanied hyperglycemia insulin resistance activation cAMP/PKA inhibition phosphodiesterase. Cod liver oil blocked sodium nitrite effects glycogenesis glycogenolysis without affecting gluconeogenesis.
