 distribution pyruvate kinase (ATP pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) nervous system studied immunofluorescence histochemical procedure using nitro blue tetrazolium. localization various parts rat central nervous system situ, cerebellar cerebral cortex, compared found vitro cultures cerebellum, spinal ganglia, cerebral astrocytes, skin fibroblasts. (1) Pyruvate kinase found predominantly cytoplasm neuronal cell bodies. (2) Large neurons better visualized small ones. (3) glial localization clearly demonstrated situ, although rule presence M1 pyruvate kinase. (4) Regions expected rich nerve terminals, cerebellar glomeruli cerebellar molecular layer, showed intense staining even cell bodies negative. expected, owing previous demonstration presence M1 pyruvate kinase nerve ending subcellular fractionation methods. (5) localization similar situ tissue culture, except nerve processes better seen latter astrocytes sometimes stained vitro. (6) Variation intensity staining observed similar cell types section culture. could represent different metabolic functional maturational states.
