 Numerous hepatic adipocytic genes transcriptionally controlled glucose insulin. case, example, pyruvate kinase L (L-PK) gene liver spot 14 gene adipocytes, coding proteic factors glycolysis lipogenesis, respectively. hepatic level, role insulin mainly stimulate synthesis glucokinase, needed phosphorylation glucose glucose 6-phosphate. efficient regulation L-PK gene glucose also needs synthesis glucose transporter (Glut2): absence, transcription gene independent presence glucose medium. role Glut2 enhance depletion gluconeogenic cells glucose-6-phosphate (G6-P) cultivated without glucose. G6-P seems act one metabolites pentose phosphate pathway, probably pentose phosphate, maybe xylulose 5-phosphate. active metabolites pathway could control activity protein kinase protein phosphatase cascades, leading modification phosphorylation state glucose response complex. complex assembled so-called glucose/carbohydrate response elements (GIRE, ChoRE) composed E boxes CACGTG type, less modified, forming palindrome whose parts separated five bases. sequences able bind USF1 USF2 proteins, seem necessary glucose response. However, binding USF proteins GIRE L-PK gene, appreciated vivo footprints, modulated nutritional conditions. Therefore, USF proteins could interact different partners targets regulating cues: transcription factors bound immediate vicinity glucose response complex, notably HNF4 factor, and, maybe, proteins interacting USF factors assembled GIRE. actually ongoing experiments try appreciate nature role partners, evaluate metabolic response mice whose USF genes disabled homologous recombination.
