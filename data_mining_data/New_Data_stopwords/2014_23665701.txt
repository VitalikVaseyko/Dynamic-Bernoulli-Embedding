 previous study reported thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) promotes cholesterol synthesis via cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A/cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (cAMP/PKA/CREB) pathway binding TSH receptors (TSHR) liver. hepatic cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway also plays important role maintaining fasting glucose homeostasis. findings implied possible role TSH hepatic glucose metabolism. study, used TSH receptor knockout mice (Tshr-ko mice) clarify effect Tshr deletion hepatic glucose metabolism, investigated whether effects TSH directly regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis HepG2 cells. Tshr-ko mice exhibited decreased fasting blood glucose levels, increased insulin sensitivity normal level fasting plasma insulin. Tshr deletion impaired hepatic glucose production down-regulating expression glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK) mRNA, two rate-limiting enzymes hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhancing abundance hepatic glucokinase (GK), first enzyme regulating glycogen synthesis. Moreover, Tshr deletion inhibited protein expression hepatic phospho-CREB increased protein expression hepatic phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), two up-stream regulators PEPCK G6P mRNA. HepG2 cells, TSH increased expression G6P PEPCK mRNA level. results indicated simulative effects TSH hepatic glucose production vivo vitro, suggesting novel role TSH hepatic glucose metabolism.
