 results quantitative spectrophotometric enzyme assay, fluorescent spot test cytochemical assay glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency compared systematically. high sensitivity spectrophotometric assay fluorescent spot test detection severely deficient individuals confirmed. detection heterozygote females, however tests unreliable; sensitivities fluorescent spot test spectrophotometric assay 32% 11% respectively. Specificities tests high (99%). Introduction ratio glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase (G-6-PD/PK ratio) activities increased sensitivity spectrophotometric assay nearly 100%. concluded fluorescent spot test used diagnosis G-6-PD deficiency developing countries; whereas spectrophotometric enzyme assays available, G-6-PD/PK ratio always performed. cases ratio less 0.70, cytochemical analysis indicated.
