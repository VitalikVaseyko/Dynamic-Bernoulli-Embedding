 Although altered metabolic pathway important diagnostic maker therapeutic target cancer, poorly understood cancer stem cells (CSCs). show CD133 (+) hepatocellular CSCs distinct metabolic properties, characterized active glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, compared CD133 (-) cells. Inhibition PDK4 LDHA markedly suppresses CD133 (+) stemness characteristics overcome resistance sorafenib (current chemotherapeutic agent hepatocellular cancer). Addition glucose lactate CD133 (-) cells promotes CSC phenotypes, evidenced increased CD133 (+) cell population, elevated stemness gene expression enhanced spheroid formation. Furthermore, liver-specific miRNA, miR-122, inhibits CSC phenotypes regulating glycolysis targeting PDK4. findings suggest enhanced glycolysis associated CD133 (+) stem-like characteristics metabolic reprogramming miR-122 PDK4 may represent novel therapeutic approach treatment hepatocellular cancer.
