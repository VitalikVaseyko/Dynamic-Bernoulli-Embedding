 BACKGROUND: nutrition growth factor restriction due serum depletion affect trophoblast function remains poorly understood. performed proteomic differential study effects serum depletion first trimester human immortalized trophoblast cell line. METHODS: viability HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells culture 0, 0.5 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) assayed via MTT 24, 48 64 h. comparative proteomic analysis cells grown FBS levels 24 h performed using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), followed mass spectrometry protein spot identification, database search bioinformatics analysis expressed proteins. Differential spots identified using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (n = 3, significance level 0.10, > 0.642) and/or ANOVA (n = 3, p < 0.05). RESULTS: results showed low serum doses serum depletion differentially affect cell growth protein expression. Differential expression seen 25 % protein spots grown 0.5 % FBS 84 % grown 0 % FBS, using 10 % serum physiological control. 0.5 % FBS, difference related biological processes typically affected serum, cell cycle, regulation apoptosis proliferation. addition changes, serum-depleted proteome observed downregulation keratin 8, upregulation vimentin, glycolytic enzymes enolase pyruvate kinase (PKM2) tumor progression-related inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) enzyme. proteins regulated total serum depletion, affected growth 0.5 % serum, members glycolytic nucleotide metabolic pathways epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting adaptive switch characteristic malignant cells. CONCLUSIONS: comparative proteomic analysis identified proteins first evidence protein expression response serum depletion trophoblast cell model. results show serum depletion induces specific changes protein expression concordant main cell metabolic adaptations EMT, resembling progression malignant phenotype.
