 study focussed cardioprotective effect robinin doxorubicin-induced cardio-toxicity Sprague Dawley rats. experimental period, animals sacrificed various parameters cardiac markers, toxicity parameters, antioxidant status, ROS generation, lipid peroxidation status inflammatory parameters assessed. Gene expression study RT-PCR analysis proteins expression study western blotting done. Doxorubicin causes significant increase levels cardiac marker enzymes, namely lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phospokinase (CPK), toxicity parameters like serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). Antioxidant enzyme levels decreased; lipid peroxidation products heart tissue inflammatory markers, namely cyclooxygenase (COX2) lipooxygenase (LOX15) significantly increased. Gene expression study RT-PCR analysis transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), Smad2, murine double minute (Mdm2), Smad3, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), Smad4 Smad7 significantly altered. western blotting study p53, Bcl-2 Bax also showed altered expression. supplementation Robinin along DOX caused normalised level parameters cardio-toxicity. study revealed cardioprotective nature Robinin doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity modulating TGF-beta1 signaling pathway Sprague Dawley rats.
