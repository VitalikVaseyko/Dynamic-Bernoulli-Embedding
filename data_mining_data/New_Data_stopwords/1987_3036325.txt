 Pyruvate kinase levels monitored Neurospora crassa mycelium (grown different carbon sources varying time intervals) immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies raised purified enzyme preparation. Pyruvate kinase specific mRNA demonstrated hybridization Northern dot blots total RNA N. crassa pyruvate kinase gene fragment. Two pyruvate kinase specific mRNA species detected mycelia ages examined. age-dependent carbon source dependent variation pyruvate kinase protein mRNA levels encountered: registered increase 20 h subsequent decline; growth acetate sucrose resulted significantly higher yields both, relative medium containing ethanol alanine. Stress caused heat shock depressed pyruvate kinase mRNA levels.
