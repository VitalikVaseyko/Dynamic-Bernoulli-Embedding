 isolated hepatocytes fasted rats, 0.5 mM adenosine inhibited gluconeogenesis glutamine, lactate pyruvate. inhibition due adenosine conversion adenosine kinase. increase ketone body release observed presence lactate pyruvate, two phenomena (i.e. inhibition gluconeogenesis increased ketone-body release) linked. alanine, dihydroxyacetone serine substrates, adenosine change gluconeogenesis; however, conversion adenosine kinase also inhibited gluconeogenesis. asparagine substrate, 0.5 mM adenosine increased gluconeogenesis; increase due adenosine conversion adenosine deaminase. However, adenosine conversion adenosine kinase inhibited gluconeogenesis asparagine. Thus, whatever substrate used, adenosine conversion adenosine kinase inhibited gluconeogenesis. inhibitory effect adenosine gluconeogenesis cannot related decrease Pi concentration increase ATP pool. Beside effect gluconeogenesis, adenosine inhibited ketogenesis measured without added substrate; adenosine conversion adenosine kinase also involved inhibition ketogenesis.
