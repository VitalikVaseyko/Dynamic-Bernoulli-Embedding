 Myosin creatine kinase co-immobilized onto Immunodyne films mimic behaviour creatine kinase bound M-line myofilaments. Mg-ATPase activity bound myosin studied coupled enzymatic assay, detects Mg-ADP bulk solution means pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. competition Mg-ADP pyruvate kinase creatine kinase either free solution co-immobilized myosin studied various creatine phosphate concentrations. Bound creatine kinase competed efficiently present low amounts, corresponding activity ratio higher 1:20,000 creatine kinase pyruvate kinase molar ratio higher 1:1000 creatine kinase myosin. Mg-ADP produced myosin ATPase vicinity film diffuse bulk solution but, presence creatine phosphate, recycled Mg-ATP neighbouring creatine kinase. existence unstirred layer near surface film sufficient explain channeling ADP (or ATP) co-immobilized myosin creatine kinase, without direct interaction 'intimate coupling' enzymes. problem determine importance kind facilitated diffusion myofilaments vivo.
