 1. effect fatty acids interconversion pyruvate dehydrogenase active (nonphosphorylated) inactive (phosphorylated) forms measured rat liver mitochondria respiring state 3 pyruvate plus malate 2-oxoglutarate plus malate state 4 state 3 transition presence different substrates. content intramitochondrial adenine nucleotides determined parallel experiments. 2. Decrease intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio propionate increase palmitoyl-L-carnitine state 3 accompanied shift steady-state pyruvate dehydrogenase system towards active inactive form, respectively. 3. Transition high energy state (state4) active respiration (state3) mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate plamitoyl-L-carnitine causes increase amount active form pyruvate dehydrogenase due decrease ATP/ADP ratio matrix. 4. change ATP/ADP ratio observed presence octanoate mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate 2-oxoglutarate state 3 state 4 state 3 transition. Simultanelusly, significant change phosphorylation state pyruvate dehydrogenase occurs low amount enzyme active form present octanoate octanoate plus 2-oxoglutarate. Pyruvate abolishes effect octanoate shifts steady-state pyruvate dehydrogenase system towards active form. 5. results indicate fatty acids influence interconversion pyruvate dehydrogenase mainly changing intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio. However, comparison steady-state level pyruvate dehydrogenase system presence different substrates various metabolic conditions provides evidence accumulation acetyl-CoA high level NADH may promote phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase. 6. Pyruvate exerts protective effect phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase presence fatty acids short, medium long chain manner depends concentration. suggested isolated mitochondria pyruvate counteracts effect acetyl-CoA NADH pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
