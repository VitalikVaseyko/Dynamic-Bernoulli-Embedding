 unique metabolism solid tumours (aerobic glycolysis, i.e., Warburg effect) basis diagnosing cancer metabolic imaging might also associated resistance apoptosis characterises cancer. glycolytic phenotype cancer appears common denominator diverse molecular abnormalities cancer may associated (potentially reversible) suppression mitochondrial function. generic drug dichloroacetate orally available small molecule that, inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, increases flux pyruvate mitochondria, promoting glucose oxidation glycolysis. reverses suppressed mitochondrial apoptosis cancer results suppression tumour growth vitro vivo. Here, review scientific clinical rationale supporting rapid translation promising metabolic modulator early-phase cancer clinical trials.
