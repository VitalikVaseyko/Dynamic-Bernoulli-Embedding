 Human NADH CoQ oxidoreductase composed total 43 subunits demonstrated major site production superoxide mitochondria. Incubation rat heart mitochondria ATP resulted phosphorylation two mitochondrial membrane proteins, one M(r) 6 kDa consistent NDUFA1 (MWFE), one 18kDa consistent either NDUFS4 (AQDQ) NDUFB7 (B18). Phosphorylation subunits enhanced cAMP derivatives protein kinase (PKA) inhibited PKA inhibitors (PKAi). mitochondrial membranes incubated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phosphorylation 18kDa protein 6kDa protein observed. NADH cytochrome c reductase activity decreased superoxide production rates NADH substrate increased. hand, protein kinase A-driven phosphorylation, NADH cytochrome c reductase increased superoxide production decreased. Overall 4-fold variation electron transport rates observable extremes phosphorylation events. suggests electron flow complex production oxygen free radicals regulated phosphorylation events. light observations discuss potential model dual regulation complex production oxygen free radicals PKA PDH kinase.
