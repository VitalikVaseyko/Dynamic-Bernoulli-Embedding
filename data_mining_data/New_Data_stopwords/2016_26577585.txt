 Hyperinsulinemia associated type 2 diabetes may contribute development vascular diseases. Although recently reported enhanced contractile responses serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) observed arteries type 2 diabetes models, causative factors detailed signaling pathways involved remain unclear. purpose study investigate whether high insulin would amplifier 5-HT-induced contraction rat carotid arteries whether contraction involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) signaling, insulin-mediated signaling pathway. rat carotid arteries organ-cultured insulin (for 24 h), (1) contractile responses 5-HT significantly greater (vs. vehicle), (2) insulin-induced enhancement 5-HT-induced contractions largely suppressed inhibitors insulin receptor (IR) (GSK1838705A), PI3K (LY294002), PDK1 (GSK2334470), (3) levels phosphorylated forms PDK1 myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) greater upon 5-HT stimulation. addition, rat carotid arteries organ-cultured activator PDK1 (PS48), 5-HT-induced contraction greater, suppressed PDK1 inhibition PI3K inhibition. addition, MYPT1 PDK1 phosphorylation upon 5-HT stimulation enhanced (vs. vehicle). results suggest high insulin levels amplify 5-HT-induced contraction. Moreover, present results indicated direct linkage IR/PI3K/PDK1 activation 5-HT-induced contraction rat carotid arteries first time.
