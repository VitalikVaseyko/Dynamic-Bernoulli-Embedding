 Enzyme activities immunological reactivities seven different enzymes assayed polymorphonuclear leukocytes 10 newborns, 10 aged (over 80 years old) 10 young adults (20-30 years old). Polymorphonuclears chosen newborns, aged people, young cells whose life span hours only. Five cytoplasmic enzymes immunologically studied means monospecific antienzyme sera: leukocyte pyruvate kinase immunoinactivation, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase glucose phosphate-isomerase electroimmunodiffusion, lactic dehydrogenase (muscle-type) radial immunodiffusion. Two lysosomal enzymes (alpha-mannosidase beta-glycuronidase) titrated immunologically polyvalent antihuman leukocyte rabbit serum. Small significant differences activity observed several enzymes. contrast, significant difference found, seven enzymes, regards ratio enzyme activity/immunological reactivity, newborns, young adults aged people. results support theory decreased accuracy protein synthesis machinery responsible aging death. contrast, authors emphasize enzyme abnormalities reported various authors old animals old fibroblast cultures closely resemble demonstrated "post-translational modifications" case human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
