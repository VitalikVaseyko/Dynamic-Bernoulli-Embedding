 growth conditions glucose oxygen excess, Staphylococcus aureus predominantly accumulates acetate culture medium, suggesting phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase (Pta-AckA) pathway plays crucial role bacterial fitness. Previous studies demonstrated conditions also induce S. aureus CidR regulon involved control cell death. Interestingly, CidR regulon comprised two operons, encoding pyruvate catabolic enzymes, suggesting intimate relationship pyruvate metabolism cell death. examine relationship, introduced ackA pta mutations S. aureus tested effects bacterial growth, carbon energy metabolism, cid expression, cell death. Inactivation Pta-AckA pathway showed drastic inhibitory effect growth caused accumulation dead cells pta ackA mutants. Surprisingly, inactivation Pta-AckA pathway lead decrease energy status bacteria, intracellular concentrations ATP, NAD(+), NADH higher mutants. However, inactivation pathway increased rate glucose consumption, led metabolic block pyruvate node, enhanced carbon flux glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Intriguingly, disruption Pta-AckA pathway also induced CidR regulon, suggesting activation alternative pyruvate catabolic pathways could important survival strategy mutants. Collectively, results study demonstrate indispensable role Pta-AckA pathway S. aureus maintaining energy metabolic homeostasis overflow metabolism.
