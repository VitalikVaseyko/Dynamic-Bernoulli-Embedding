 investigated whether yield B vitamin folic acid could elevated Bacillus subtilis. Strategies increasing folic acid yield investigated employing computer-aided flux analysis mutation. Controlling activity enzyme pyruvate kinase placing inducible control one strategy devised elevate yield insuring rapid growth rate results. single mutation strategies included amplifying expression genes folate operon overexpressing Escherichia coli aroH gene, encodes 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphoheptonate aldolase. latter could conceivably elevate abundance folic acid precursor, para-aminobenzoic acid. Strains combined two mutations also constructed. Overall, strain possessing inducible pyruvate kinase, overexpressed aroH, increased transcription translation genes folic operon exhibited best yield. yield eightfold higher displayed parent B. subtilis 168 strain.
