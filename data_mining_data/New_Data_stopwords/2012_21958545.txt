 Compared normal differentiated cells, cancer cells altered metabolic regulation support biosynthesis expression M2 isozyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2) plays important role anabolic metabolism. M1 isoform highly active enzyme, alternatively spliced M2 variant considerably less active expressed tumors. exact mechanism decreased pyruvate kinase activity contributes anabolic metabolism remains unclear, hypothesized activation PKM2 levels seen PKM1 may promote metabolic program conducive cell proliferation. report third chemotype series PKM2 activators based 2-oxo-N-aryl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-sulfonamide scaffold. synthesis, structure activity relationships, selectivity notable physiochemical properties described.
