 part ongoing study elucidate SAR bisindole alkaloid inhibitors evolutionary conserved MRSA pyruvate kinase (PK), present synthesis biological activity six dihalogenated analogues naturally occurring sponge metabolite deoxytopsentin, including naturally occurring dibromodeoxytopsentin. active compounds displayed potent low nanomolar inhibitory activity MRSA PK concomitant significant selectivity MRSA PK human PK orthologues. Computational studies suggest potent MRSA PK inhibitors occupy region small interface enzyme tetramer amino acid sequence divergence common human PK orthologues may contribute observed selectivity.
