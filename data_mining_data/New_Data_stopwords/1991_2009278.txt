 protein kinase phosphorylates pyruvate kinase (PK) vitro purified characterized foot muscle anoxia-tolerant gastropod mollusc Busycon canaliculatum. Purification involved four steps: poly(ethylene glycol) fractionation, affinity chromatography Blue agarose, ion-exchange chromatography phosphocellulose preparative isoelectric focusing (pI = 5.5). activity monitored following changes pyruvate kinase I50 values L-alanine previously linked changes degree enzyme phosphorylation. correlation enzyme phosphorylation changes L-alanine inhibition constant also directly demonstrated present paper radioactively labelling PK [tau-32P]ATP. final purified protein kinase solution gave single band SDS-gel electrophoresis molecular weight 37,000 +/- 2000. Kinetic analysis purified protein kinase (PK-kinase) showed pH optimum 7.0, absolute requirement magnesium ions (Km = 1.29 mM), relatively high affinity MgATP (Km = 57 microM), inhibition increasing salt concentrations (I50 = 55 mM KCl). protein kinase activity affected either spermine, heparin, cAMP, cGMP concentrations CaCl2 less 10 mM. enzyme phosphorylate either phosphofructokinase glycogen phosphorylase, two enzymes also phosphorylated anoxia whelks. purified enzyme different catalytic subunit cAMP-dependent protein kinase shown inability cAMP stimulate protein kinase stages preparation; cAMP activate either crude enzyme, 7% poly(ethylene glycol) supernatant, column eluant peak fractions measured changes pyruvate kinase kinetic parameters.
