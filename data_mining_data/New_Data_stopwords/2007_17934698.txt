 Culturing hepatocytes combination LPS, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta IFN-gamma resulted inhibition glucose output glycogen prevented repletion glycogen freshly cultured cells. reduced glycogen mobilisation correlated lower cell glycogen content reduced rate glycogen synthesis [U-(14)C]glucose rather alterations either total phosphorylase phosphorylase activity. change percentage glycogen exported glucose production lactate plus pyruvate indicating redistribution Gluc-6-P cannot explain failure liver export glucose. Although changes glycogen mobilisation correlated production, inhibition synthase inclusion L-NMMA culture medium failed prevent inhibition either glycogen accumulation mobilisation proinflammatory cytokines, precluding involvement response. LPS plus cytokine treatment effect total glycogen synthase activity although activity ratio lowered, indicative increased phosphorylation. inhibition glycogen synthesis correlated fall intracellular concentrations Gluc-6-P UDP-glucose absence measured changes kinase activity, suggested fall Gluc-6-P reduces substrate supply glycogen synthase phosphatase activity. fall Gluc-6-P coincided reduction total glucokinase hexokinase activity within cells, significant change either translocation glucokinase glucose-6-phosphatase activity. demonstrates direct cytokine effects glycogen metabolism independent changes glucoregulatory hormones.
