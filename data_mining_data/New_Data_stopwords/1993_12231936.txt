 Homogeneous cytosolic pyruvate kinase endosperm germinating castor oil (Ricinus communis L. cv Hale) seeds potently activated polyethylene glycol. addition 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol pyruvate kinase reaction mixture caused 2.6-fold increase maximal velocity 12.5- 2-fold reductions Km values phosphoenolpyruvate ADP, respectively. Glycerol, ethylene glycol, bovine serum albumin also enhanced pyruvate kinase activity, albeit lesser extent polyethylene glycol. addition 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol elution buffer high-performance gel filtration chromatography purified cytosolic pyruvate kinase helped stabilize active heterotetrameric native structure enzyme. higher degree inhibition MgATP, lower sensitivity inhibitors 3-phosphoglycerate fructose- 1,6-bisphosphate, also observed presence 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. concluded (a) plant cytosolic pyruvate kinase activity regulation, like regulatory pyruvate kinases, modified extreme dilution assay medium, probably result deaggregation native tetrameric enzyme, (b) ATP probably major metabolic effector germinating castor endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase vivo.
