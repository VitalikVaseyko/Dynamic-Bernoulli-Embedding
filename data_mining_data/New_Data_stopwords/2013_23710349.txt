 expression profiles adiponectin, resistin, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPK alpha ), hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha ), key enzymes glucose fatty acid metabolism oxidative phosphorylation rat retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (RpWAT) 45-day cold acclimation examined. transient suppression day 1, adiponectin protein level increased following sustained cold exposure. parallel, day 1, protein level HIF-1 alpha strongly induced AMPK alpha suppressed, afterwards reverse seen. more, initial decrease day 1, sequential increase pyruvate dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, ATP synthase decrease acetyl-CoA carboxylase (from day 3) observed. Similar adiponectin, protein level resistin showed biphasic profile: increased days 1, 3, 7 decreased control 21 days cold-acclimation. summary, data suggest adiponectin resistin important integrators RpWAT metabolic response roles plays cold acclimation. seems AMPK alpha mediate adiponectin effects metabolic remodeling RpWAT cold acclimation.
