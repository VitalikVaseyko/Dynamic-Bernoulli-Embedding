 Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate kinase 1 (Pyk1) demonstrated associated immunoprecipitate yeast protein kinase holoenzyme (HA-Tpk1.Bcy1) phosphorylated cAMP-dependent process. glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Pyk1 GST-Pyk2 phosphorylated vitro bovine heart protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit immobilized yeast HA-Tpk1. specificity constant phosphorylation GST-Pyk1 GST-Pyk2 bovine catalytic subunit range value Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide). fusion proteins phosphorylated vivo, intact cells overexpressing protein, vitro using crude extracts, source protein kinase A, wild type strain used phosphorylated using strain one TPK gene attenuated mutation (tpk1(w1)). effect phosphorylation Pyk activity assayed partially purified preparations three strains, containing different endogenous protein kinase activity levels. Pyk1 activity measured different phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations absence presence activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1.5 mm. Preliminary kinetic results derived comparison Pyk1 obtained extracts highest versus lowest protein kinase activity indicate enzyme active upon phosphorylation conditions; absence activator shows shift titration curve phosphoenolpyruvate left increase Hill coefficient, whereas presence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate shows n(H) value 1.4, compared n(H) 2 Pyk1 obtained extracts almost null protein kinase activity.
