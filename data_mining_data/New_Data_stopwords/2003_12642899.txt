 kinetic assay total calcium serum developed based activation Ca(++)-ATPase free Ca(++) [Ca(++)](f) maintained EGTA reaction mixture. concentration Ca(++)(f) dependent total reference calcium added serum calcium. Ca(++)-ATPase activity coupled reduction NADH pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) monitored change absorbance 340 nm. calcium normal serum 10.08 +/- 0.24 mg/dl (n = 35) method o-cresolphthalein complexone (CPC) method, total calcium 35 serum samples 10.14 +/- 0.54 mg/dl. range within-run coefficient variations (CVs) method 0.9-2.87% 8-12 mg/dl day-to-day CVs 0.72-3.17%. presence ions standard clinical interfering agents affect assay system. correlation values obtained method (y) CPC method (x) normal serum was: = 1.064x-0.580 mg/dl (r = 0.912, n = 59).
