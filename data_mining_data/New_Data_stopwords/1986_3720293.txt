 Pyruvate kinase, purified flounder liver, two forms, i.e. PK PK II, characterized sigmoid kinetics phosphoenolpyruvate substrate pH 6.3, 6.7 7.7. K0.5 PEP increases increasing pH. PK PK II show hyperbolic kinetics ADP, inhibited ADP concentrations 1-2 mM. K0.5 ADP decreases increasing pH. PK PK II differ K0.5 values PEP factor least 2, showing highest figures latter. K0.5 ADP two enzyme forms. nucleotide diphosphates replace ADP substrate. nucleoside diphosphates arranged rank order showing decreasing effectiveness substrate, different rank orders obtained PK PK II.
