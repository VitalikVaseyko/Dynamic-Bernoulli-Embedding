 reduction secretion ovarian hormones, principally estrogen, consequence menopause. Estrogens act primarily female sex hormones, also exert effects different physiological systems including central nervous system. treatment normally used reduce symptoms menopause hormone therapy, seems effective treating symptoms, may responsible adverse effects. Based this, increasing demand alternative therapies minimize signs symptoms menopause. present study investigated effect ovariectomy and/or physical exercise activities energy metabolism enzymes, creatine kinase (cytosolic mitochondrial fractions), pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, complex II, cytochrome c oxidase, well ATP levels hippocampus adult rats. Adult female Wistar rats 90 days age subjected ovariectomy (an animal model widely used mimic postmenopausal changes). Thirty days procedure, rats submitted exercise protocol, performed three times week 30 days. Twelve hours last training session, rats decapitated subsequent biochemical analyzes. Results showed ovariectomy affect activities pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase complex II, decreased activities creatine kinase (cytosolic mitochondrial fractions) cytochrome c oxidase. ATP levels also reduced. Exercise produce expected results since able partially reverse activity creatine kinase cytosolic fraction. results study suggest estrogen deficiency, occurs result ovariectomy, affects generation systems energy homeostasis, reducing ATP levels hippocampus adult female rats.
