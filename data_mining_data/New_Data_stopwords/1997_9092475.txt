 Although differences among species enzyme maximal activity concentration often interpreted adaptive important regulating metabolism, differences may simply reflect phylogenetic divergence. Phylogenetic analysis expression glycolytic enzymes among 15 taxa North American fish genus (Fundulus) indicated variation enzyme concentration due evolutionary distance may nonadaptive. However, three enzymes' maximal activities covary environmental temperature adaptive value. Additionally, two pairs enzymes covary, indicating coevolution. Thus, metabolic flux may modulated many different enzymes rather single rate-limiting enzyme.
