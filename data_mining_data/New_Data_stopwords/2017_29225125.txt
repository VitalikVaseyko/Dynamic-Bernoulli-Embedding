 Many cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming known Warburg effect, characterized greater dependence glycolysis ATP generation, even normoxic conditions. Glyoxalase (GLO I) rate-limiting enzyme involved detoxification cytotoxic methylglyoxal formed glycolysis known highly expressed many cancer cells. Thus, specific inhibitors GLO expected effective anticancer drugs. previously discovered novel GLO inhibitor named TLSC702. Although strong inhibitory activity TLSC702 observed vitro enzyme assay, higher concentrations required induce apoptosis cellular level. One proposed reasons difference cancer cells alter energy metabolism leading become dependent mitochondrial respiration glycolysis (Metabolic shift) avoid apoptosis induction. Thus, assumed combination TLSC702 shikonin-a specific inhibitor pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) acts driver TCA cycle supplying pyruvate known specifically expressed cancer cells-would anticancer effects. herein show anticancer effects combination treatment TLSC702 shikonin, possible anticancer mechanism.
