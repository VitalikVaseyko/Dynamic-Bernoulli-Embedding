 Gastric lymph collected non-secreting stomach anesthetized dogs contained glucose, Na+, K+ creatine phosphokinase concentrations similar arterial gastric venous plasma. Gastric lymph contained greater concentrations pyruvate lactate either arterial gastric venous blood. Gastric lymph contained high concentration total protein similar simultaneously collected hepatic lymph. Gastric lymph collected pylorus ligated stomach distended air. procedures used another study total protein gastric lymph reported much lower found present study. lymph plasma ratio protein decreased 0.85 +/- .04 0.69 +/- .04. Pyloric ligation alone caused change lymph protein concentration.
