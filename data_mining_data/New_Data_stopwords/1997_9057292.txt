 Rhodococcus sp. 094 bacterium tested ability oxidize alkanes crude oil emulsified nonionic chemical biological surfactants. Oxidation rates measured 3-h period Warburg respirometry. 14CO2 recovery measured [1-14C]hexadecane spiked crude oil. Response emulsified oil depended physiological state bacteria (i.e., cells harvested exponential stationary growth phases) tested. Oxidation rates cells exponential growth phase negatively affected surfactant amendment. Oxidation rates cells stationary growth phase cases stimulated surfactants. stimulatory effect depended chemical structure physicochemical properties (i.e., hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)) surfactants. Surfactants intermediate HLB values (8-12) gave best results. Neither biosurfactants commercial oil-spill dispersants tested significant stimulatory effect.
