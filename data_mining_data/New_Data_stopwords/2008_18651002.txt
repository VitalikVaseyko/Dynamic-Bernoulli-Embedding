 BACKGROUND: comprehensive experimental clinical evidence either exogenous supplementation natural antioxidants augmentation endogenous antioxidants attenuates myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVES: investigate effects chronic administration silymarin ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction rats. METHODS: Silymarin administered orally Wistar albino rats (200 g 250 g) three different doses (100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg 500 mg/kg), gastric gavage one week. end period, control (ischemia-reperfusion) groups silymarin-treated groups subjected 30 min occlusion left anterior descending coronary artery thereafter reperfused 4 h. RESULTS: Ischemia-reperfusion resulted significant cardiac necrosis, indicated elevated levels serum marker enzymes serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-isoenzyme creatine kinase. significant rise end products myocardial lipid peroxides (malondialdehydes [MDAs]), loss antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase reduced glutathione) increased levels myeloperoxidase heart tissue observed animals subjected vivo myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Infarct size measured using staining agent 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. lead II electrocardiogram monitored various intervals throughout experiment. DISCUSSION: present study showed silymarin protected endogenous antioxidant enzymes, suppressed neutrophil infiltration ischemia-reperfusion limited infarct size, concomitant reduction serum MDA, tissue MDA serum marker enzymes rats subjected 30 min coronary artery occlusion followed 4 h reperfusion. Pretreatment silymarin also protected rat hearts drop mean arterial blood pressure reperfusion, restored heart rate end reperfusion period. CONCLUSIONS: present study suggests phytochemical silymarin cardioprotective activity ischemia-reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction rats.
