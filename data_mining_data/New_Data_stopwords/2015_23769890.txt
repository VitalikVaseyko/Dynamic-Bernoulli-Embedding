 examine effect glucose cerebral metabolism glutamine, rat brain slices incubated 5mM [3-(13)C]glutamine without 5mM unlabeled glucose. Tissue plus medium extracts analyzed using enzymatic (13)C NMR techniques fluxes enzymatic steps involved calculated mathematical model. demonstrate glucose increased alanine, pyruvate glutamate accumulations decreased ammonium ions accumulation, aspartate accumulation labeling, GABA labeling. order determine participation glutamine synthetase glucose added incubation medium, incubated rat brain slices 5mM [3-(13)C]glutamine plus 5mM unlabeled glucose without 2mM methionine sulfoximine (MSO). results indicate 77% newly appeared glutamine formed via glutamine synthetase 23% endogenous sources; stimulation [3-(13)C]glutamine removal MSO also strongly suggests existence cycle [3-(13)C]glutamine [3-(13)C]glutamate. work also demonstrates glucose increased fluxes hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, flux alpha-ketoglutarate glutamate flux glutamine synthetase whereas inhibited fluxes aspartate aminotransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase GABA aminotransferase.
