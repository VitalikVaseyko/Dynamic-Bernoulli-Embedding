 primary catabolic pathways fungi Penicillium notatum P. duponti, Mucor rouxii M. miehei examined measuring relative rate 14CO2 production different carbon atoms specifically labelled glucose. found organisms dissimilate glucose predominantly via Embden--Meyerhof pathway conjunction tricarboxylic acid cycle lesser extent pentose phosphate pathway. Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) activity could detected initially Penicillium species interference mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.17) NADH oxidase (EC 1.6.99.3). combination differential centrifuging heat treatment Penicillium cell-free extracts presence fructose-6-phosphate removed interfering enzymes. kinetic characteristics phosphofructokinase P. notatum M. rouxii described. enzyme presents highly cooperative kinetics fructose-6-phosphate. kinetics ATP show cooperativity inhibition excess ATP observed. addition AMP activated P. notatum enzyme, relieving ATP inhibition; slight inhibition AMP observed M. rouxii enzyme. contrast M. rouxii pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activated 50-fold fructose-1,6-diphosphate whereas pyruvate kinase P. notatum P. duponti unaffected fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
