 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes interconversion pyruvate lactate, critical fuel metabolites skeletal muscle particularly exercise. However, physiological relevance LDH remains poorly understood. show Ldhb expression induced exercise human muscle negatively correlated changes intramuscular pH levels, marker lactate production, isometric exercise. found expression Ldhb regulated exercise-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Ldhb gene promoter reporter studies demonstrated PGC-1alpha activates Ldhb gene expression multiple conserved estrogen-related receptor (ERR) myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) binding sites. Transgenic mice overexpressing Ldhb muscle (muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-Ldhb) exhibited increased exercise performance enhanced oxygen consumption exercise. MCK-Ldhb muscle shown enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activity increased mitochondrial gene expression, suggesting adaptive oxidative muscle transformation. addition, mitochondrial respiration capacity increased lactate production decreased MCK-Ldhb skeletal myotubes culture. Together, results identified previously unrecognized Ldhb-driven alteration muscle mitochondrial function suggested mechanism adaptive metabolic response induced exercise training.
