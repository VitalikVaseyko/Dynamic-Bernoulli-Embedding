 Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) distinct metabolic properties support metabolic energetic needs affect stemness. particular, high glycolysis critical generation maintenance PSCs. However, unknown PSCs maintain acquire metabolic signature. study, found core pluripotency factors regulate glycolysis directly controlling expression glycolytic enzymes. Specifically, Oct4 directly governs Hk2 Pkm2, important glycolytic enzymes determine rate glycolytic flux. overexpression Hk2 Pkm2 sustains high levels glycolysis embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Moreover, maintenance high glycolysis levels Hk2 Pkm2 overexpression hampers differentiation preserves pluripotency ESCs absence leukemia inhibitory factor. Overall, study identifies direct molecular connection core pluripotency factors ESC metabolic signatures demonstrates significance metabolism cell fate determination.
