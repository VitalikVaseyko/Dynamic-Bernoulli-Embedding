 Cancer progression accompanied widespread transcriptional changes metabolic alterations. widely accepted origin cancer traced mutations accumulate time, relatively recent evidence favors similarly fundamental role alterations epigenome tumorigenesis. Changes epigenetics arise post-translational modifications histones DNA exploited cancer cells upregulate and/or downregulate expression levels oncogenes tumor suppressors, respectively. Although mechanisms behind modifications, particular lead gene silencing activation, still understood, enzymatic machinery epigenetics require metabolites substrates cofactors. result, activities influenced metabolic state cell. purpose review give overview cancer epigenetics metabolism provide examples converge.
