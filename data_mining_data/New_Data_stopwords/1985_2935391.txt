 glycolytic metabolism key enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, studied brain areas: anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, septum hippocampus adult rats pharmacologically induced hyperthyroidism. oxidative metabolism glucose accelerated brain areas treatment high doses T3, shown increase HK activity, approaching normality reducing dose. decrease also observed PFK activity effect assayed doses thyroxine. anterior cortex brain area show significant variations PK activity effects treatment thyroid hormones. hand, general inhibition glycolytic anaerobic pathway treatment T3 observed.
