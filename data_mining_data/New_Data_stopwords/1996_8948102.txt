 determined nucleotide sequence 40 kb fragment right arm chromosome XV Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Subsequent analysis revealed 18 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) numbered 06257 06357, ARS, two tRNA genes Ty2 flanking elements. Ten ORFs sequenced previously: TEA1, RPA43, RPA190, SGC1 (also called TYE7) REV1, PUT4, CIN1, MNE MRE4 (also called MEK1). Among others, two seem code new pyruvate kinase new ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; three interesting homology genes located left arm chromosome I. similarity chromosome extends left sequence presented (Parle et al., submitted Yeast). homologous genes two chromosomes placed relative order.
