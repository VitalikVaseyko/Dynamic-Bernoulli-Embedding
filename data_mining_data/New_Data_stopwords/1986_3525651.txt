 Previously reported studies showed protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) children associated significant alterations muscle cell composition, characterized increased cell water Na, decreased concentrations K, Mg, glycolytic citric acid cycle metabolites. PCM, i.c. H2O levels Na K significantly related, multiple regression analysis, combined set simultaneously measured levels cell metabolites, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate. Cell bioactivities also affected PCM. Activities enzymes pyruvate kinase malic isocitric dehydrogenases significantly reduced muscle homogenates PCM children. Kinetic analysis pyruvate kinase indicated 8-10-fold reduction maximal velocity enzyme, consistent reduction enzyme protein. Additionally, reduced levels ATP equilibrium constant adenylate kinase system observed leukocytes PCM children. Alterations activity energy-dependent Na pump noted others association accumulation i.c. Na severe malnutrition. Neither protein synthesis amino acid pools measured previously reported studies. Recent data several laboratories show "profiles" i.c. plasma amino acids different, uremics control subjects. control subjects, leukocytes cell model, level protein synthesis predicted multiple regression analyses simultaneously measured levels plasma i.c. amino acids. Intracellular amino acids better predictors. 19 intracellular amino acids, combination five accounted 54% variance protein synthesis normal, healthy adults. Levels predictor cell amino acids can, turn, predicted different combinations apparently unrelated plasma amino acids. adult uremic patients stabilized hemodialysis, leukocytes cell model, levels ATP, energy charge, adenylate kinase pyruvic kinase activities reduced. Others reported increased i.c. water Na contents, impaired Na pump activity. Cell levels methionine branched-chain amino acids, valine, leucine, isoleucine, protein synthesis also significantly reduced. multiple regression analysis, observed levels protein synthesis energy charge hemodialyzed uremic patients largely accounted different combinations intracellular amino acid healthy subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
