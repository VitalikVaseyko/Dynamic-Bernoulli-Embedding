 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one commonly diagnosed cancers world. Elevated glucose metabolism availability oxygen, phenomenon called Warburg effect, important cancer cell growth. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) rate-limiting enzyme gluconeogenesis frequently lost various types cancer. Here, demonstrated expression FBP1 downregulated HCC patient specimens decreased expression FBP1 associated poor prognosis. Low expression FBP1 correlated high levels histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) HDAC2 proteins HCC patient tissues. Treatment HCC cells HDAC inhibitors knockdown HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 restored FBP1 expression inhibited HCC cell growth. HDAC-mediated suppression FBP1 expression correlated decreased histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) FBP1 enhancer. Restored expression FBP1 decreased glucose reduction lactate secretion inhibited HCC cell growth vitro tumor growth mice. data reveal loss FBP1 due histone deacetylation associates poor prognosis HCC restored FBP1 expression HDAC inhibitors suppresses HCC growth. findings suggest repression FBP1 HDACs important implications HCC prognosis treatment.
