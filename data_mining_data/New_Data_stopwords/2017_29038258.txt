 Fluctuating environments individual physiological diversity force bacteria constantly adapt optimize uptake substrates. focus two similar two-component systems (TCSs) Escherichia coli belonging LytS/LytTR family: BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) YpdA/YpdB. TCSs respond extracellular pyruvate, albeit different affinities, typically postexponential growth, system regulates expression single transporter gene, yjiY yhjX, respectively. obtain insights biological significance TCSs, analyzed activation target promoters single-cell level. found unimodal cell-to-cell variability; however, degree variance strongly influenced available nutrients differed two TCSs. hypothesized activation either TCSs helps individual cells replenish carbon resources. test hypothesis, compared wild-type cells btsSR ypdAB mutant two metabolically modulated conditions: protein overproduction persister formation. Although wild-type cells able overproduce green fluorescent protein (GFP), half btsSR ypdAB population unable overexpress GFP. Moreover, percentage persister cells, tolerate antibiotic stress, significantly lower wild-type cells btsSR ypdAB population. Hence, suggest BtsS/BtsR YpdA/YpdB network contributes balancing physiological state cells within population.IMPORTANCE Histidine kinase/response regulator (HK/RR) systems enable bacteria respond environmental physiological fluctuations. Escherichia coli members Enterobacteriaceae possess two similar LytS/LytTR-type HK/RRs, BtsS/BtsR (formerly YehU/YehT) YpdA/YpdB, form functional network. systems activated response external pyruvate, typically cells face overflow metabolism post-exponential growth. Single-cell analysis activation respective target genes yjiY yhjX revealed cell-to-cell variability, range variation strongly influenced externally available nutrients. Based phenotypic characterization btsSR ypdAB mutant compared parental strain, suggest TCS network supports optimization physiological state individuals within population.
