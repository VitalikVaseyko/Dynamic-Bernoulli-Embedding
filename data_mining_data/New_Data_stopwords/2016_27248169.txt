 Reducing mtDNA content considered critical step metabolism restructuring cell stemness restoration neoplastic development. However, connections mtDNA depletion metabolism reprograming-based cancer cell stemness prostate cancers still lack studies. Here, demonstrated human CRPC cell line PC3 tolerated high concentration mtDNA replication inhibitor ethidium bromide (EtBr) mtDNA depletion triggered universal metabolic remodeling process. Failure completing process caused lethal consequences. mtDNA depleted (MtDP) PC3 cells could steadily maintained special medium slow cycling status. MtDP PC3 cells contained immature mitochondria exhibited Warburg effect. Furthermore, MtDP PC3 cells resistant therapeutic treatments contained greater cancer stem cell-like subpopulations: CD44+, ABCG2+, side-population ALDHbright. conclusion, results highlight association mtDNA content, mitochondrial function cancer cell stemness features.
