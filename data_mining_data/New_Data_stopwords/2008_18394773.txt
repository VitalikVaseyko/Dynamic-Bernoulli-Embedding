 OBJECTIVES: little known biology granulosa cell tumors ovary. hallmark granulosa cell tumors ovary extensive growth, distant metastases however, rarely found. hypothesise granulosa cell tumors ovary one hand need stimulate vascularisation; hand glucose metabolism altered ensure supply nutrients metabolites. Increased glycolysis, main source energy supply, considered important malignant transformation. Thus, focussed selection key factors angiogenesis tumor glycolysis study metabolic characteristics granulosa cell tumors ovary. STUDY DESIGN: analysed 32 tumor specimens immunohistochemical expression vascular endothelial growth factor, phosphorylated Akt, M2 pyruvate kinase isoenzyme, transketolase-like enzyme 1. controls, stained 10 samples normal ovaries. RESULTS: found expression vascular endothelial growth factor 94%, transketolase-like enzyme 1 81%, phosphorylated Akt well M2 pyruvate kinase isoenzyme 53% specimens. significant differences expression levels primary recurrent tumors. Temporal analysis marker expression primary tumors recurrences patients revealed increase decrease marker expression overtime. contrast granulosa cell tumors, normal ovaries showed expression markers analysed granulosa cells. CONCLUSION: results show granulosa cell tumors ovary express vascular endothelial growth factor important stimulator tumor angiogenesis well several molecular markers glycolysis. dependence granulosa cell tumors ovary glycolytic pathway may provide biochemical basis therapeutic strategies involving glycolytic inhibitors.
