 (1) Objectives: Mitochondrial disorders (MIDs) genetically phenotypically heterogeneous group slowly rapidly progressive disorders onset birth senescence. variegated clinical presentation, MIDs difficult diagnose frequently missed early late stages. need provide biomarkers, easily obtained case suspecting MID initiate diagnostic work-up. (2) Methods: Literature review. (3) Results: Biomarkers diagnostic purposes used confirm suspected diagnosis facilitate speed diagnostic work-up. diagnosing MIDs, number dry wet biomarkers proposed. Dry biomarkers MIDs include history clinical neurological exam structural functional imaging studies brain, muscle, myocardium ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR-spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), functional MRI. Wet biomarkers blood, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnosing MIDs include lactate, creatine-kinase, pyruvate, organic acids, amino acids, carnitines, oxidative stress markers, circulating cytokines. role microRNAs, cutaneous respirometry, biopsy, exercise tests, small molecule reporters possible biomarkers unsolved. (4) Conclusions: disadvantages putative biomarkers MIDs hardly meet criteria acceptable biomarker (missing longitudinal studies, validated, easily feasible, cheap, ubiquitously available) MIDs manifest brain, muscle, myocardium. currently lack validated biomarkers diagnosing MIDs.
