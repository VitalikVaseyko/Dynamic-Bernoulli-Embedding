 hypothesis Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase functions cooperative alternating sites mechanism based largely results [18O]phosphate exchange experiments (Bild, G. S., Janson, C. A., Boyer, P. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8109-8115). experiments, [18O]Pi----succinate (predominantly) exchange appeared proceed greater rates (relative apparent amount succinyl-CoA released enzyme) low ATP incubations containing ATP, CoA, succinate, [18O]Pi, 0.48 hydroxylamine (as succinyl-CoA trap), pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase ADP trap. conclusion arrived succinyl-CoA binding one site inversely related ATP binding second site. Thus, residence time succinyl-CoA binding site would longer lower ATP concentrations. experiments show that, incubation conditions described Bild et al. (Bild, G. S., Janson, C. A., Boyer, P. D. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8109-8115), succinyl-CoA efficiently trapped. Thus, ATP concentrations 3.6 150 microM, concentrations succinyl-CoA 13 78 microM observed. Succinate----succinyl-CoA exchange reactions carried range ATP subsaturating succinyl-CoA concentrations found markedly inhibited addition ADP trap. inhibition pronounced higher ATP levels. saturating succinyl-CoA concentration (1.5 mM), addition ADP trap actually stimulated succinate----succinyl-CoA exchange. conditions, ATP----Pi exchange greatly depressed. results interpreted follows. ADP required optimal binding succinyl-CoA, latter present subsaturating concentrations; thus, ADP trap inhibits reaction. ATP exerts stimulatory action succinate---- succinyl-CoA exchange "other site" effect, i.e. binding noncatalytic site succinyl-CoA synthetase, facilitates binding release succinyl-CoA catalytic site. ATP may also exert negative effects inhibiting site binding ATP interfering site succinyl-CoA binding subsaturating concentrations latter. data support notion half-sites mechanism applies succinyl-CoA synthetase, suggest [18O]Pi----succinate exchange data instrumental development cooperative alternating sites hypothesis re-evaluated.
