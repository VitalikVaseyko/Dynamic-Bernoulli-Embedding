 Basic metabolism generates energy anaerobic aerobic metabolization glucose. articular cartilage obtains substrate oxygen synovial fluid. concentrations within cartilage diminish increasing proximity basal layer bone-cartilage boundary. gradients depend upon cell density consumption cells. gradient partial oxygen pressure (PO2) could provide conditions Pasteur effect, which, however, yet clearly observed. Metabolic reactions chondrocytes positive negative glucose gradient hitherto examined, object present study. oxygen consumption (QO2) articular cartilage pig femoral heads measured manometrically (Warburg technique) absence glucose presence concentrations 1.25 10.0 mM. close correlation QO2 concentration consumption glucose nature glucose-induced respiratory suppression (Crabtree effect). consumption glucose, rise proportion concentration, exceed 15.7 mumol/gdw/h. maximum lactate production 20 23 mumol/gdw/h attained 5 mM glucose showed increase higher substrate concentrations. stoichiometric "lactate deficiency" means absorbed glycolyzed glucose channeled synthesizing storage processes. glucose-free incubation, despite aerobic conditions, lactate utilized chondrocytes unphysiologically high concentrations greater 10 mM. Potassium cyanide reduced QO2 80-90% sign activity non-mitochondrial oxidases. monoiodoacetate (MIA), respiration fell dramatically 4 h substrate-free incubation. concluded results that, physiological conditions, glucose level synovia reduces consumption oxygen well-glucose-supplied upper layer articular cartilage, thus allowing oxidative compensation diminishing glycolysis basal zone. Crabtree effect, demonstrated first time chondrocytes, thus seems role essential regulatory mechanism basic metabolism cartilage.
