 Cancer metabolism regained substantial research interest recent years. focus mostly primary tumor, metabolic adjustments dissemination less extensively researched. Deadhesion impairs glucose transport brings ATP deficit leads apoptosis. survive, metastasizing cancer cells need increase ATP synthesis, involves mitochondrial activity accomplished part peroxide signaling. change metabolism, associated cancer spread, different Warburg effect. Therefore important distinguish metabolic adjustments primary tumor cells disseminating tumor cells. general, likely metabolic responses environmental cues commonly occur cell biology.
