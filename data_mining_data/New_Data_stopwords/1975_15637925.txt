 efflux lactate dehydrogenase haemoglobin human erythrocytes prolonged incubation 37 degrees significantly reduced ATP, ADP, AMP, UTP, creatine phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate lesser extent fructose, glucose 6-phosphate fructose 6-phosphate, glucose. Iodoacetate, however, markedly increased loss haemoglobin slightly increased lactate dehydrogenase. Phospholipase C greatly accelerated relase haemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase human erythrocytes, effect also reduced presence ATP ADP. loss lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase cells treated phospholipase C increased ATP content fell. series experiments action phospholipase C stopped subsequent addition trypsin, ATP ADP (1 mmol/l) significantly reduced efflux haemoglobin, AMP effect. results consistent conclusion previous work enzyme leakage related diminution energy content cells. protective action AMP cells treated phospholipase C, however, differs earlier findings rat lymphocytes suggested red cells might converted ATP direct effect permeability cell membrane.
