 objective study examine clinical signs, laboratory parameters, course disease Abyssinian Somali cats pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. clinical course 25 PK-deficient cats followed time period 0.8-11.3 years (median 4.3). Eleven cats (age 0.8-7.8 years, median 4.4) show signs according owners. 14 cats (age 0.1-5 years, median 1.7) owners noted lethargy (10), diarrhoea (seven), pale mucous membranes (six), inappetence (six), poor coat quality (six), weight loss (four), icterus (four), pica (two). Sixteen cats used breeding least diagnosis. Laboratory abnormalities included anaemia (70%), increased aggregated reticulocyte counts (94%), hyperglobulinaemia (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (53%), increased liver enzymes (47%). Six 25 affected cats died (four) euthanased (two) ages ranging 1.3 11.3 years (median 4.1) presumably PK-deficiency. findings emphasise PK deficiency shows variation age onset severity signs. PK-deficient cats asymptomatic testing PK deficiency breeding strongly recommended.
