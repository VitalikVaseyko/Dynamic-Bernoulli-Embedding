 Thrombin potent modulator endothelial function and, stimulation NF-kappaB, induces endothelial expression intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). cell surface adhesion molecules recruit inflammatory cells vessel wall thereby participate development atherosclerosis, increasingly recognized inflammatory condition. principal receptor thrombin endothelial cells protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), member G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Although known PAR-1 signaling NF-kappaB depends initial PKC activation, subsequent steps leading stimulation canonical NF-kappaB machinery remained unclear. Here, demonstrate complex proteins containing CARMA3, Bcl10, MALT1 links PAR-1 activation stimulation IkappaB kinase complex. IkappaB kinase turn phosphorylates IkappaB, leading degradation release active NF-kappaB. Further, find although CARMA3.Bcl10.MALT1 signalosome shares features CARMA1-containing signalosome found lymphocytes, significant differences signalosomes communicate cognate receptors. Specifically, whereas CARMA1-containing lymphocyte complex relies 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 assembly activation, CARMA3-containing endothelial signalosome functions completely independent 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 instead relies beta-arrestin 2 assembly. Finally, show thrombin-dependent adhesion monocytes endothelial cells requires intact endothelial CARMA3.Bcl10.MALT1 signalosome, underscoring importance signalosome mediating one significant pro-atherogenic effects thrombin.
