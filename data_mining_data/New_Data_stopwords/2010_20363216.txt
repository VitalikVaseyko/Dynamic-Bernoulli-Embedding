 Diabetes mellitus chronic metabolic disorder affecting 6% population worldwide complications rapidly reaching epidemic scale. Cinnamomum zeylanicum widely used alternative system medicine treatment diabetes. present study, performed bioassay guided fractionation chloroform extract C. zeylaniucm identified cinnamaldehyde (CND) active principle diabetes. continuation it, detailed study undertaken elucidate mode antidiabetic action STZ induced diabetic rats. Oral administration CND (20 mg/kg bw) diabetic rats 2 months showed significant improvement (p<0.001) muscle hepatic glycogen content. vitro incubation pancreatic islets CND enhanced insulin release compared glibenclamide. insulinotropic effect CND found increase glucose uptake glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation peripheral tissues. treatment also showed significant improvement altered enzyme activities pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, median lethal dose (LD(50)) CND could obtained even 20 times (0.4 g/kg bw) effective dose. high margin safety CND, developed potential therapeutic candidate treatment diabetes.
