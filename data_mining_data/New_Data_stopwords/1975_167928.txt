 levels various enzymes components glycolytic respiratory pathways yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae determined step-down, anaerobic-to-aerobic transition. activities determined adjunct respective metabolite data reported first paper series. clear data anaerobic conditions induce environment conducive express glycolytic enzyme activities, manifesting differential induction/repression effect oxidative enzymes. NAD/NADH mediated mechanism proposed explain difference. enzymes assayed cytochrome c oxidase shows direct response oxygen challenge consequently suggested assembly enzyme trigger mechanism rate-limiting step aerobic adaptation.
