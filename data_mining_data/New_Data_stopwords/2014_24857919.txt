 last 100 years, many studies performed determine biochemical histopathological phenomena mark origin neoplasms. end last century, leading paradigm, currently well rooted, considered origin neoplasms set genetic and/or epigenetic mutations, stochastic independent single cell, rather, stochastic monoclonal pattern. However, last 20 years, two important areas research underlined numerous limitations incongruities pattern, hypothesis so-called cancer stem cell theory revaluation several alterations metabolic networks typical neoplastic cell, so-called Warburg effect. Even specific "metabolic sign" known 85 years, last years given attention; therefore, so-called Warburg hypothesis used multiple independent surveys. Based accurate analysis series considerations biophysical thermodynamic events literature, demonstrate homogeneous pattern cancer stem cell theory, Warburg hypothesis stochastic monoclonal pattern; pattern could contribute considerably first basis development new uniform theory origin neoplasms. Thus, new possible epistemological paradigm represented; paradigm considers Warburg effect specific "metabolic sign" reflecting stem origin neoplastic cell, where, specific metabolic order, essential reason genetic instability intrinsic neoplastic cell defined.
