 recent development dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) gives NMR sensitivity follow metabolic processes living systems high temporal resolution. article, apply dissolution DNP study metabolism hyperpolarized U-(13)C,(2)H7-glucose living, perfused human breast cancer cells. Spectrally selective pulses used maximize signal main product, lactate, whilst preserving glucose polarization; way, C1-lactate C3-lactate could observed high temporal resolution. production lactate T47D breast cancer cells characterized Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics, K(m) = 3.5 +/- 1.5 mM V(max) = 34 +/- 4 fmol/cell/min. high sensitivity method also allowed us observe quantify glycolytic intermediates dihydroxyacetone phosphate 3-phosphoglycerate. Even enhanced DNP signal, many glycolytic intermediates could detected directly. Nevertheless, applying saturation transfer methods, glycolytic intermediates glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate could observed indirectly. method shows great promise elucidation distinctive metabolism metabolic control cancer cells, suggesting multiple ways whereby hyperpolarized U-(13)C,(2)H7-glucose NMR could aid diagnosis characterization cancer vivo.
