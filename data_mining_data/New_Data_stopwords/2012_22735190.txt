 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) terminal enzyme anaerobic glycolysis key hypoxia/anoxia survival animals. study, effects anoxic submergence (20 h 7 degrees C nitrogen-bubbled water) assessed LDH liver anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtle, red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). Liver LDH aerobic anoxic turtles purified homogeneity two steps. kinetic properties thermal stability purified LDH analyzed, revealing significant differences two enzyme forms V(max), K(m) pyruvate, I(50) pyruvate well melting temperature determined differential scanning fluorimetry. phosphorylation state aerobic anoxic forms LDH visualized ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining, results indicating anoxic form higher phosphorylation state. Incubation studies promoted protein kinase versus protein phosphatase actions showed changes phosphorylation state aerobic anoxic forms mimicked anoxia-responsive changes K(m) pyruvate I(50) pyruvate. high phosphate form liver LDH occurs anoxic turtles appears less active form. Turtle liver LDH also subject another form posttranslational modification, protein acetylation, 70% higher content acetylated lysine residues anoxic versus aerobic LDH. first study show LDH function anoxia-tolerant animal differentially modified aerobic anoxic states via mechanism posttranslational modification.
