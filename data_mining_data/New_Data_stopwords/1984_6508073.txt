 Arginine biosynthesis regulation presence different carbon nitrogen sources growth medium Mycobacterium smegmatis studied. Replacement glycerol glucose fructose increased activities acetylglutamate kinase, acetylornithinase ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme activities arginine biosynthetic pathway. presence succinate, fumarate, pyruvate acetate growth medium (replacement citrate) also increased enzyme activities. However, glutamate glutamine used nitrogen source place asparagine, enzyme activities decreased. presence ornithine arginine growth medium repressed enzyme activities, though degree repression slight. phenomenon repression arginine ornithine confirmed dialysis experiments. Arginine inhibited ornithine transcarbamylase activity cells grown asparagine nitrogen source, activated cells grown arginine. Thus, addition weak transcriptional control arginine biosynthetic enzymes, feedback regulation ornithine transcarbamylase arginine also regulated arginine biosynthesis M. smegmatis grown asparagine nitrogen source.
