 investigate whether mitochondrial intermembrane space together extramitochondrial space form homogeneous pool adenine nucleotides, rat-heart mitochondria studied reconstituted systems pyruvate kinase ADP-producing enzymes varied localization. hexokinase system, ADP produced extramitochondrially added yeast hexokinase, whereas creatine kinase system mitochondrial creatine kinase responsible ADP regeneration intermembrane space. dependence mitochondrial respiration extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio systems investigated experimentally means computer simulation. Near resting state, higher [ATP]/[ADP] ratios found creatine kinase system hexokinase system rate respiration. maintaining substantial creatine kinase-stimulated respiration presence pyruvate kinase excess explained two-compartment model considering diffusion limitations adenine nucleotides. diffusion rate constant (8.7 +/- 4.7) 10(4) microliters X mg-1 X min-1 ADP ATP estimated, resulting rate-dependent concentration differences 13.7 microM AdN extramitochondrial space AdN-translocator maximum rate oxidative phosphorylation rat-heart mitochondria. results support assumption ADP diffusion towards AdN-translocator limited extramitochondrial concentration low, resulting dynamic compartmentation adenine nucleotides mitochondrial intermembrane space.
