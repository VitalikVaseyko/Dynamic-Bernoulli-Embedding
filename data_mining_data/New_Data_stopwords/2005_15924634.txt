 OBJECTIVE: compare results proteomics cerebellum frontal lobe aged. METHOD: Proteins isolated human cerebellums frontal lobes separated two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. proteins stained silver colloidal coomassie blue produce high-resolution map proteome. Selected proteins map in-gel digested trypsin resulting tryptic peptides analyzed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. mass spectrometric data used identify proteins searches SWISSPROT protein sequence database. RESULTS: Three up-regulated protein spots 2D gels cerebellums found compared frontal lobes. protein spots identified antioxidant protein 2, creatine kinase precursor, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C. Two down-regulated proteins cerebellums identified pyruvate kinase M1 isozyme glial fibrillary acidic protein. 30 common proteins, expressions altered cerebellums frontal lobes, also identified. CONCLUSIONS: data used future studies differential protein expression neurological disorders. proteins useful discovering molecular mechanisms degenerative dementia brain aging.
