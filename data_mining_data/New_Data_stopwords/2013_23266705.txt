 OBJECTIVE: Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) transcription factor involved hepatic lipogenesis. function part control AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Given known effects ethanol AMPK PP2A, plausible ethanol might enhance fatty acid synthesis increasing activity ChREBP. hypothesized another potential pathway ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis mediated activation ChREBP. METHODS: effects ethanol ChREBP assessed hepatoma cells C57BL/6J mice fed Lieber-DeCarli diet. RESULTS: cells exposed ethanol (50 mM) 24 hours, activity liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) promoter-luciferase reporter increased approximately 4-fold. Ethanol feeding mice resulted translocation ChREBP cytosol nucleus. Protein phosphatase 2A activity increased liver ethanol-fed mice 22%. found difference levels hepatic Xu-5-P ethanol-fed mice controls. Transfection constitutively active AMPK expression plasmid suppressed basal activity LPK luciferase reporter abolished effect ethanol reporter activity. However, transfection rat hepatoma cells dominant-negative AMPK expression plasmid induced basal LPK luciferase activity approximately 20%. effect ethanol ChREBP attenuated presence okadaic acid, inhibitor PP2A. CONCLUSIONS: effects ethanol AMPK PP2A may result activation ChREBP, providing another potential mechanism ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. However, additional okadaic acid-insensitive effects appear important well.
