 Two cDNA codings glycolytic enzymes cloned cDNA library constructed schizont stage avian parasite Eimeria tenella. Enolase pyruvate kinase cDNA fully sequenced compared sequences enzymes organisms. Although enzymes already detected sporozoite stage, expression enhanced first schizogony accordance anaerobic conditions part life cycle parasite. activating conditions, microscopic observations suggest glycolytic enzymes relocalised inside sporozoites moreover part secreted. enzymes also localised apex first generation merozoites. Enolase partly observed inside nucleus sporozoites schizonts. Taken together, results suggest glycolytic enzymes function glycolysis anaerobic intracellular stages may also participate invasion process and, enolase, control gene regulation.
