 Diseased tissue often characterized abnormalities intermediary metabolism. Observing alterations situ may lead improved understanding pathological processes novel ways monitor processes noninvasively human patients. Although (13)C stable isotope safe use animal models disease well human subjects, utility metabolic tracer largely limited ex vivo analyses employing analytical techniques like mass spectrometry nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neither techniques suitable noninvasive metabolic monitoring, low abundance poor gyromagnetic ratio conventional (13)C make poor nucleus imaging. However, recent advent hyperpolarization methods, particularly dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), makes possible enhance spin polarization state (13)C many orders magnitude, resulting temporary amplification signal sufficient monitoring kinetics enzyme-catalyzed reactions living tissue magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetic resonance imaging. Here, review DNP techniques monitor metabolism cultured cells, perfused hearts, perfused livers, focusing experiences hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate. present detailed approaches optimize DNP procedure, streamline biological sample preparation, maximize detection specific metabolic activities. also discuss practical aspects choice metabolic substrates hyperpolarization studies outline current technical conceptual challenges field, including efforts use hyperpolarization quantify metabolic rates vivo.
