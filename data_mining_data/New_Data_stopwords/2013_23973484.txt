 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) third enzyme oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Recently, reported knockdown 6PGD inhibited lung tumor growth vitro xenograft model mice. study, continued examine functional role 6PGD cancer. show 6PGD expression positively correlates advancing stage lung carcinoma. search functional signals related 6PGD, discovered knockdown 6PGD significantly inhibited phosphorylation c-Met tyrosine residues known critical activity. downregulation c-Met phosphorylation correlated inhibition cell migration vitro. Overexpression constitutively active c-Met specifically rescued migration proliferation phenotype 6PGD knockdown. Therefore, 6PGD appears required efficient c-Met signaling migration tumor cells vitro.
