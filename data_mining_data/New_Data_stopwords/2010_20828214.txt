 effect compressive stress electrochemical behavior flexible supercapacitors assembled single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) film electrodes 1 aqueous electrolytes different anions cations thoroughly investigated. under-pressed capacitive resistive features supercapacitors studied means cyclic voltammetry measurements electrochemical impedance analysis. results demonstrated specific capacitance increased first saturated corresponding decreases series resistance, charge-transfer resistance, Warburg diffusion resistance increased pressure 0 1723.96 kPa. Wettability well ion-size effect different aqueous electrolytes played important roles determine pressure dependence behavior suerpcapacitors applied pressure. improved high-frequency capacitive response 1172 Hz knee frequency, significantly higher compared reported values, observed compressive pressure 1723.96 kPa, indicating improving excellent high-power capability supercapacitors pressure. experimental results thorough analysis described work provide fundamental insight pressure effects supercapacitors also give important guideline future design next generation flexible/stretchable supercapacitors industrial consumer applications.
