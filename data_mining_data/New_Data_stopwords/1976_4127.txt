 kinetics rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), phosphorylated cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase source, unphosphorylated enzyme compared. effects pH various concentrations substrates, Mg2+, K+ modifiers studied. absence fructose 1, 6-diphosphate pH 7.3, phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared lower affinity phosphoenolpyruvate (K0.5=0.8 mM) unphosphorylated enzyme (K0.5=0.3 mM). enzyme activity vs. phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve sigmoidal phosphorylated enzyme Hill coefficient 2.6 compared 1.6 unphosphorylated enzyme. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate increased apparent affinity enzyme forms phosphoenolpyruvate. saturating concentrations activator, kinetics enzyme forms transformed approximately hyperbolic curve, Hill coefficient 1.0 K0.5 0.04 mM phosphoenolpyruvate. apparent affinity enzyme fructose 1, 6-diphosphate high 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate K0.5=0.06 muM unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase 0.13 muM phosphorylated enzyme. However, presence 0.5 mM alanine plus 1.5 mM ATP, higher fructose 1, 6-diphosphate concentration needed activation, K0.5 0.4 muM unphosphorylated enzyme 1.4 muM phosphorylated enzyme. results obtained strongly indicate phosphorylation pyruvate kinase may also inhibit enzyme vivo. inhibition important gluconeogenesis.
