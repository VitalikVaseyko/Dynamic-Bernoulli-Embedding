 pressure overload-induced hypertrophy, heart increases reliance glucose fuel decreasing fatty acid oxidation. key regulator substrate switching hypertrophied heart peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). tested hypothesis down-regulation PPARalpha essential component cardiac hypertrophy levels increased mass, gene expression, metabolism pharmacologically reactivating PPARalpha. Pressure overload (induced constriction ascending aorta 7 days rats) resulted cardiac hypertrophy, increased expression fetal genes (atrial natriuretic factor skeletal alpha-actin), decreased expression PPARalpha PPARalpha-regulated genes (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4), caused substrate switching (measured ex vivo isolated working heart preparation). Treatment rats specific PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643 (8 days) affect trophic response atrial natriuretic factor induction pressure overload. However, PPARalpha activation blocked skeletal alpha-actin induction, reversed down-regulation measured PPARalpha-regulated genes hypertrophied heart, prevented substrate switching. PPARalpha reactivation concomitantly resulted severe depression cardiac power efficiency hypertrophied heart (measured ex vivo). Thus, PPARalpha down-regulation essential maintenance contractile function hypertrophied heart.
