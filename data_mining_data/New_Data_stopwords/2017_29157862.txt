 Scutellarin, one natural flavonoids, widely clinically used treating many diseases China. Recently, scutellarin demonstrated broad spectrum anti-proliferative activities multiple cancer cell lines. However, molecular mechanism action remains investigated. herein report design synthesis biotinylated scutellareins probes, applied discover scutellarein interacting proteins. Finally, show scutellarin directly targets pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) inhibits cytosolic activity decrease glycolytic metabolism; hand, scutellarin may also participate regulating cell cycle apoptotic proteins activating MEK/ERK/PIN1 signaling pathway promote nuclear translocation PKM2.
