 levels glycogen, glucose, lactate, well activities ten enzymes carbohydrates metabolism brain, liver white muscle sea scorpion investigated. Metabolite concentrations change brain levels glycogen lactate constant rest tissues investigated. Glucose concentration decreased liver increased muscle. brain hypoxia decreased activity hexokinase increased one pyruvate kinase, phosphoglucoisomerase fructoso-1,6-bisphosphatase. liver enzymes showed tendency decrease activities. muscle activities phosphofructokinase phosphoglucoisomerase decreased. Mechanisms carbohydrates metabolism regulation hypoxia discussed.
