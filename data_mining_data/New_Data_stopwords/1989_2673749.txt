 Eight-week-old, female Wistar fatty rats lean littermates given 30% sucrose solution addition laboratory chow diet water 7 weeks. fatty rats hyperinsulinemic hyperlipidemic, normoglycemic drank water. hepatic activities insulin-inducible glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), malic enzyme (ME) higher fatty rats lean rats, whereas insulin-suppressible glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity similar types rats, indicating normal response hepatic enzymes hyperinsulinemia fatty rats. drank sucrose solution, fatty rats, lean rats, developed hyperglycemia 200 mg/dl. Plasma insulin triglyceride concentrations increased types rats. Although hepatic activities GK, PK, lean rats, PK fatty rats increased response increase plasma insulin, GK activity decreased fatty rats. hand, G6Pase activity increased types rats. result, G6Pase/GK ratio, may reflect net glucose handling liver, increased twofold fatty rats, alter lean rats. findings, conclude sucrose ingestion induces increase hepatic glucose production derangement hepatic enzyme profile resultant decrease hepatic glucose handling may one pathogenic factors participating development hyperglycemia Wistar fatty rats.
