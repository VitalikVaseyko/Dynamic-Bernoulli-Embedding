 OBJECTIVE: investigate protein expression prostate cancer using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) mass spectrometry. STUDY DESIGN: Cells collected 29 peripheral zone tumors benign tissue scraping cut surfaces radical prostatectomy specimens. Samples suspended medium protease inhibitors prepared 2-DE. Gels analyzed, protein spots differed quantitatively tumor benign tissue identified via mass spectrometric fingerprinting tryptic fragments tandem mass spectrometry sequence analysis. RESULTS: total, 63 spots differed cancer benign samples (p < 0.01); 56 overexpressed (> 1.5 fold) cancer 7 underexpressed (< 0.6 fold). Among overexpressed proteins transcription factors (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1) enzymes involved gene silencing (chromobox protein), protein synthesis (39S ribosomal protein L12, BiP protein, protein disulfide isomerase), degradation (cytosol aminopeptidase, endopeptidase Clp, inorganic pyrophosphatase) energy metabolism (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, pyruvate dehydrogenase), heat-shock proteins (60 70 kd), structural proteins (cytokeratins) membrane proteins (stomatinlike protein 2). CONCLUSION: protein profile prostate cancer differs benign tissue. Several potential target proteins detection evaluation prognosis prostate cancer identified.
