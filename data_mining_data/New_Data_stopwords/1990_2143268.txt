 activities hexokinase (ATP:hexose-6-phosphate transferase, E.C. 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (ATP:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, E.C.2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate transferase, E.C. 2.7.1.40), kinetic behaviour two morphological forms Trypanosoma cruzi (epimastigotes metacyclic trypomastigotes) studied. kinetic responses three enzymes respective substrates normalized hyperbolic forms velocity versus substrate concentration plots. Hexokinase phosphofructokinase showed higher activity epimastigotes metacyclics, whereas pyruvate kinase similar activity forms parasite. specific activity hexokinase epimastigotes 102.00 mUnits/mg protein apparent Km value glucose 35.4 microM. Metacyclic forms showed specific activity 55.25 mUnits/mg Km value 46.3 microM. kinetic parameters (specific activity Km fructose 6-phosphate) phosphofructokinase epimastigotes 42.60 mUnits/mg 0.31 mM metacyclics 13.97 mUnits/mg 0.16 mM, respectively. contrary, pyruvate kinase forms T. cruzi show significant differences kinetic parameters. specific activity epimastigotes 37.00 mUnits/mg Km phosphoenolpyruvate 0.47 mM, whereas metacyclics values 42.94 mUnits/mg 0.46 mM, respectively. results presented work, clearly demonstrate quantitative change glycolytic pathway culture forms T. cruzi.
