 Rat hepatocytes isolated enzymatic dissociation liver must attach order survive hours. conventional culture conditions, rapidly lose highly differentiated functions, e.g. adult isozymic forms, enzyme response specific hormones cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase activities. Incompletely differentiated cells perinatal regenerating hepatocytes, transiently exhibit differentiated state. Therefore, regulation hepatic functions, particularly enzyme activities cannot studied days. Hepatocyte survival rate maintenance specific functions dependent nutrient composition medium well substrate. Complex matrices, particularly derived connective liver biomatrix, appear important favorable effect. However, regardless culture conditions specific functions cannot quantitatively maintained several days. Recent observations strongly suggest problem may overcome mimicking vivo specific cell-cell interactions. Thus co-cultured liver epithelial cell line, probably derived biliary ductular cells, adult hepatocytes remain able synthesize high levels albumin conjugate drugs. conditions, cells secrete abundant heterogeneous extracellular material. co-cultures maintained serum-free medium specific liver functions altered experimentally. model could appropriate studying long-term induction modulation liver enzyme activities defined experimental conditions.
