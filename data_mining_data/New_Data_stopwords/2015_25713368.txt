 Increase concentration plasma L-cysteine closely associated defective insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells, results type 2 diabetes (T2D). study, investigated effects prolonged L-cysteine treatment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells mouse pancreatic islets, found treatment reversibly inhibited glucose-induced ATP production resulting GSIS without affecting proinsulin insulin synthesis. Comprehensive metabolic analyses using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed prolonged L-cysteine treatment decreased levels pyruvate downstream metabolites. addition, methyl pyruvate, membrane-permeable form pyruvate, rescued L-cysteine-induced inhibition GSIS. Based results, found vitro MIN6 cells, L-cysteine specifically inhibited activity pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2), isoform pyruvate kinases catalyze conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate. L-cysteine also induced PKM2 subunit dissociation (tetramers dimers/monomers) cells, resulted impaired glucose-induced ATP production GSIS. DASA-10 (NCGC00181061, substituted N,N'-diarylsulfonamide), specific activator PKM2, restored tetramer formation activity PKM2, glucose-induced ATP production, biphasic insulin secretion L-cysteine-treated cells. Collectively, results demonstrate impaired insulin secretion due exposure L-cysteine resulted direct binding inactivation PKM2 suggest PKM2 potential therapeutic target T2D.
