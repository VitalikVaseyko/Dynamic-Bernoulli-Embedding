 death effector domain (DED) mammalian apoptosis mediator, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), induces Escherichia coli cell death aerobic culture conditions, yet mechanisms FADD-DED induces cell death fully understood. Oxidative stress implicated one mechanisms. Using proteomic approach validation coexpression analysis, illustrate overexpression FADD-DED E. coli invokes protein expression changes facilitate conversion pro-oxidant NADH antioxidant NADPH. Typically, isocitrate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase downregulated malate dehydrogenase upregulated. reasoned change E. coli cells active response reduce size NADH pool, thereby decreasing level ROS generation. coexpression studies, observed DNA binding protein Hns, induces growth arrest overexpressed heterologously, alleviated cell killing effect FADD-DED. FADD-DED expressed noncovalently linked multimeric protein membrane E. coli. Exogenous treatment E. coli cells FADD-DED presence membrane component induced cell death, accompanied shift redox balance decrease cellular ATP level. Cell death blocked prior expression thioredoxin. Localization FADD-DED membrane may shift cells state stimulates fuels ROS generation. cell death mechanism mediated ROS may mimic antibiotic-mediated bacterial cell death Bax-mediated apoptosis mammalian cells. results provide common mechanistic feature ROS-involved cell death throughout prokaryotes eukaryotes.
