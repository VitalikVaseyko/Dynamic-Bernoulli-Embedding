 Identifying new targeted therapies kill tumor cells sparing normal tissue major challenge cancer research. Using high-throughput chemical synthetic lethal screen, sought identify compounds exploit loss von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, occurs 80% renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). RCCs, like many cancers, dependent aerobic glycolysis ATP production, phenomenon known Warburg effect. dependence RCCs glycolysis part result induction glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Here, report identification class compounds, 3-series, exemplified STF-31, selectively kills RCCs specifically targeting glucose uptake GLUT1 exploiting unique dependence cells GLUT1 survival. Treatment agents inhibits growth RCCs binding GLUT1 directly impeding glucose uptake vivo without toxicity normal tissue. Activity STF-31 experimental renal tumors monitored [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake micro-positron emission tomography imaging, therefore, agents may readily tested clinically human tumors. results show Warburg effect confers distinct characteristics tumor cells selectively targeted therapy.
