 Growth Escherichia coli acetate requires operation anaplerotic sequence known glyoxylate bypass. pathway three different enzymes activated: malate synthase, isocitrate lyase isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase encoded genes aceB, aceA aceK, respectively. three genes clustered, order, acetate (ace) operon whose expression transcriptional control iclR gene located downstream aceK. cloned iclR gene pKK233-2 vector allows optimization transcription translation initiation. IclR repressor overproduced, purified homogeneity one-step procedure cation exchange chromatography ammonium sulfate fractionation. specific interaction operator/promoter region ace operon analyzed gel retardation DNase footprinting experiments. IclR repressor shown recognize 35 bp palindromic sequence largely overlaps -35 recognition site RNA polymerase. Moreover, formation complex IclR operator/promoter region found impaired phosphoenol pyruvate insensitive acetate, acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, oxaloacetate. results discussed terms primary regulation expression ace operon.
