 growth Escherichia coli acetate, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) partially inactivated phosphorylation thus rendered rate-limiting Krebs cycle intracellular concentration isocitrate rises which, turn, permits increased flux carbon anaplerotic sequence glyoxylate bypass. large number metabolites stimulate ICDH phosphatase inhibit ICDH kinase wild-type (E. coli ML308) thus regulate utilization isocitrate two competing enzymes, ICDH isocitrate lyase. Addition pyruvate acetate grown cultures triggers rapid dephosphorylation threefold activation ICDH, wild-type (ML308) mutants lacking pyruvate dehydrogenase (ML308/Pdh-), PEP synthase (ML308/Pps-) enzymes (ML308/Pdh-Pps-). Pyruvate stimulates growth acetate strains active PEP synthase inhibits growth strains lack enzyme. pyruvate exhausted, ICDH inactivated growth rate reverts characteristic growth acetate. pyruvate stimulates dephosphorylation ICDH strains differing capabilities pyruvate metabolism, seems likely pyruvate sufficient signal activate dephosphorylation mechanism, discount importance signals circumstances.
