 limited human renal sodium gradient-dependent glucose transporter protein (SGLT2) mRNA protein expression data reported literature. first aim study determine SGLT2 mRNA protein levels human animal models diabetic nephropathy. found expression SGLT2 mRNA protein increased renal biopsies human subjects diabetic nephropathy. contrast db-db mice changes renal SGLT2 protein expression. Furthermore, effect SGLT2 inhibition renal lipid content inflammation known. second aim study determine potential mechanisms beneficial effects SGLT2 inhibition progression diabetic renal disease. treated db/db mice selective SGLT2 inhibitor JNJ 39933673. found SGLT2 inhibition caused marked decreases systolic blood pressure, kidney weight/body weight ratio, urinary albumin, urinary thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances. SGLT2 inhibition prevented renal lipid accumulation via inhibition carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-beta, pyruvate kinase L, SCD-1, DGAT1, key transcriptional factors enzymes mediate fatty acid triglyceride synthesis. SGLT2 inhibition also prevented inflammation via inhibition CD68 macrophage accumulation expression p65, TLR4, MCP-1, osteopontin. effects associated reduced mesangial expansion, accumulation extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin type IV collagen, loss podocyte markers WT1 synaptopodin, determined immunofluorescence microscopy. summary, study showed SGLT2 inhibition modulates renal lipid metabolism inflammation prevents development nephropathy db/db mice.
