 Circulating levels lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxaloacetate, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, well isoenzymes, measured investigate possibility myocardial damage acceleration high +Gz. Serum samples analyzed 12 human volunteers before, 6 h after, 24 h several bouts accleration 6, 8, 9, 10 G. substantial elevations enzyme activities observed. However, multivariate analysis variance multiple comparisons data indicated small statistically significant (p less 0.01) increase creatine phosphokinase. results consistent enhanced skeletal muscle cell permeability consequent muscular exercise.
