 reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) pivotal cellular anti-oxidative defence strategies organisms. Although production mediated different enzyme systems relatively well-studied, metabolic networks dedicated biogenesis NADPH fully characterized. report, metabolic pathway promotes conversion reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), pro-oxidant NADPH uncovered Pseudomonas fluorescens exposed oxidative stress. Enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (PC), malic enzyme (ME), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), malate synthase (MS), isocitrate lyase (ICL) involved disparate metabolic modules, converged create metabolic network aimed transformation NADH NADPH. downregulation phosphoenol carboxykinase (PEPCK) upregulation pyruvate kinase (PK) ensured metabolic cycle fixed NADH NADPH combat oxidative stress triggered menadione insult. first demonstration metabolic network invoked generate NADPH NADH, process may effective combating oxidative stress increase anti-oxidant coupled decrease pro-oxidant.
