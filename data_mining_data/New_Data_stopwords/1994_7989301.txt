 pyruvate dehydrogenase complex large, highly organized assembly several different catalytic regulatory component enzymes. structural core complex E2-X subcomplex, consisting 60 dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (E2) subunits arranged pentagonal dodecahedron; 6 protein X 2 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase molecules tightly associated E2 60-mer. native E2-X subcomplex exhibits sedimentation coefficient 32 S. effects several chaotropes (guanidinium chloride, potassium thiocyanide, urea) E2-X subcomplex assessed. Treatment E2-X subcomplex 4 guanidinium chloride caused complete loss enzymatic activity dissociation subcomplex monomeric 1.5-3 species. Removal chaotrope dialysis 18 h resulted complete restoration E2 enzymatic activity reassembly 32 subcomplex; reassembled subcomplex contained less protein X native subcomplex. Sedimentation velocity analysis reassembled E2-X subcomplex demonstrated presence 8 assembly intermediate; sedimentation coefficient characteristic globular proteins molecular weights similar expected trimer E2. Shorter periods dialysis also gave rise 8 species; amount intermediate decreased increasing times dialysis. 8 species associated non-cooperatively yield additional assembly intermediates exhibiting sedimentation coefficients 10-32 S.
