 AIMS: reperfusion ischaemic myocardium, fatty acid oxidation rates quickly recover, glucose oxidation rates remain depressed. Direct stimulation glucose oxidation via activation pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), secondary inhibition malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD), improves cardiac functional recovery reperfusion following ischaemia. However, effects interventions evolution myocardial infarction unknown. purpose study determine whether infarct size decreased response increased glucose oxidation. METHODS RESULTS: vivo, direct stimulation PDH mice PDH kinase (PDHK) inhibitor, dichloroacetate, significantly decreased infarct size following temporary ligation left anterior descending coronary artery. results recapitulated PDHK 4-deficient (PDHK4-/-) mice, enhanced myocardial PDH activity. interventions also protected ischaemia/reperfusion injury working heart, dichloroacetate failed protect PDHK4-/- mice. addition, dramatic reduction infarct size malonyl CoA decarboxylase-deficient (MCD-/-) mice, glucose oxidation rates enhanced (secondary inhibition fatty acid oxidation) relative wild-type littermates (10.8 +/- 3.8 vs. 39.5 +/- 4.7%). cardioprotective effect MCD-/- mice associated increased PDH activity ischaemic area risk (1.89 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.52 +/- 0.05 mumol/g wet weight/min). CONCLUSION: findings demonstrate stimulating glucose oxidation via targeting either PDH MCD decreases infarct size, validating concept optimizing myocardial metabolism novel therapy ischaemic heart disease.
