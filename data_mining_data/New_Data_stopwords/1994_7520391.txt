 Inherited hemolytic anemia due pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency autosomal recessive disease Basenji dog closely resembles human PK deficiency. Characterization transcriptional translational expression PK isozymes sequencing DNA normal mutant dogs performed identify genetic defect Basenji dogs. Measurement erythrocytic PK activity ion exchange chromatography, substrate kinetics, immunologic reactivity, electrophoretic mobility suggests M2-type PK major form PK activity erythrocytes PK-deficient dogs, contrast normal dogs R-type PK activity. R-type M2-type PK mRNA detectable reticulocytes PK-deficient dogs, suggesting aberrant isozyme expression due failure erythroid maturational switch M2- R-type isozymes. Nucleotide sequence data wild-type mutant R-type PK cDNA identified single nucleotide deletion, delta C433, mutant cDNA. deduced amino acid sequence predicts truncated mutant protein devoid residues contributing catalytic site wild-type protein. absence R-type PK activity, anomalous compensatory expression M2-type PK erythroid cells PK-deficient Basenjis. PK-deficient Basenji dog may valuable somatic cell gene therapy trials involving manipulation hematopoietic stem cells.
