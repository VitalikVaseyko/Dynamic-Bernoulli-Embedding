 techniques somatic cell genetics used establish linkage relationships loci coding two forms (A B) hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30; 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucoside acetamidodeoxyglucohydrolase) determine whether structural relationship exists forms. series human-mouse hybrid cell lines, hexosaminidase B segregated independently. results reported investigators used analyze proposed structural models hexosaminidase. also able establish syntenic relationship gene locus responsible expression hexosaminidase responsible mannosephosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase-3 assign gene hexosaminidase B chromosome 5 man. thus linkage specific human autosomes enzymes implicated production lipid storage diseases.
