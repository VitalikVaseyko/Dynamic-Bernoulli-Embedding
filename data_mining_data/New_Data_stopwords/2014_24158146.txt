 glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) precursor several cellular components, including various aromatic compounds. Modifications PEP node PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) pyruvate kinase inactivation shown positive effect aromatics production capacity Escherichia coli Bacillus subtilis. study, pyruvate kinase PTS-deficient B. subtilis strains employed construction derivatives lacking shikimate kinase activity accumulate two industrially valuable chemicals, intermediates common aromatic pathway, shikimic dehydroshikimic acids. pyruvate kinase-deficient strain (CLC6-PYKA) showed best production parameters resting-cell conditions. Compared PTS-deficient strain, shikimic dehydroshikimic acids specific production rates CLC6-PYKA 1.8- 1.7-fold higher, respectively. batch fermentor culture using complex media supplemented 83 g/l glucose developed strain CLC6-PYKA, final titers 4.67 g/l (shikimic acid) 6.2 g/l (dehydroshikimic acid) produced 42 h.
