 crystal structure Ta0880, determined 1.91 resolution, Thermoplasma acidophilum revealed dimer monomer composed alpha/beta/alpha sandwich domain smaller lid domain. overall fold belongs PfkB family carbohydrate kinases (a family member Ribokinase clan) include ribokinases, 1-phosphofructokinases, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, inosine/guanosine kinases, fructokinases, adenosine kinases, many more. Based general fold, Ta0880 annotated ribokinase-like protein. Using coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay, activity Ta0880 assessed variety ribokinase/pfkB-like family substrates; activity observed ribose, fructose-1-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate. Based structural similarity nucleoside kinases (NK) Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjNK, PDB 2C49, 2C4E) Burkholderia thailandensis (BtNK, PDB 3B1O), nucleoside kinase activity investigated. Ta0880 (TaNK) confirmed nucleoside kinase activity apparent KM guanosine 0.21 muM catalytic efficiency 345,000 M(-1) s(-1) . three NKs significantly different substrate, phosphate donor, cation specificities comparisons specificity structure identified residues likely responsible nucleoside substrate selectivity. Phylogenetic analysis identified three clusters within PfkB family indicates TaNK member new sub-family broad nucleoside specificities. Proteins 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
