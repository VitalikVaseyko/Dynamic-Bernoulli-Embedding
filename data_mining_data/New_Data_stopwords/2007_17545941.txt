 earliest events induction hemorrhagic shock (HS) complex poorly understood. recently demonstrated decreased tissue perfusion hypoxia HS lead increased phosphorylation c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) vivo. purpose investigations test hypothesis hypoxia activates JNK via Rac1-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Mice subjected HS resuscitated Ringer's ethyl pyruvate solution (REPS) N-acetylcysteine (NAC), two scavengers ROS, demonstrated decreased levels phosphorylated JNK. Exposure primary mouse hepatocytes culture 1% oxygen led increased production ROS phosphorylation JNK. duration hypoxia correlated level generation ROS JNK activation. phosphorylation JNK attenuated presence ROS scavengers nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate [NDA(P)H] oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). addition, hypoxia increased activation Rac1. Inhibition Rac1 activation adenoviral gene transfer dominant-negative Rac1 (AdRac1) attenuated ROS formation JNK activation. Together, data suggest ROS generation hypoxia liver directly leads JNK activation Rac1-dependent process.
