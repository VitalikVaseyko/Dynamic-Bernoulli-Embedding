 study investigates effects physiological increments plasma thyroxine (T4) three levels biological organization thyroid-intact thyroidectomized captive western fence lizards, Sceloporus occidentalis. Two doses T4-loaded pellets elevated plasma T4 thyroid-intact lizards 4.8 +/- 0.47 10.7 +/- 2.25 20.4 +/- 5.77 ng/ml (mean +/- SE). Surgical thyroidectomy reduced T4 1.8 +/- 0.23 ng/ml, subsequent T4 pellet implantation raised T4 14.8 +/- 4.30 ng/ml. Minimal resting metabolic rate (= standard metabolic rate; SMR), common organismal metric thyroid perturbation, reduced 31% (P less 0.0001) thyroidectomy restored T4 replacement stimulated T4 supplementation thyroid-intact lizards. T4-replaced, thyroidectomized lizards, SMR significantly correlated plasma T4 (r2 = 0.626, P = 0.003, n = 11). organ level, liver mass changed treatment; heart mass decreased thyroid deficiency restored T4 replacement. molecular level, citrate synthase activity significantly reduced thyroidectomy returned control levels T4 replacement liver skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) changed cardiac muscle. Citrate synthase affected tissue T4 supplementation thyroid-intact lizards. Pyruvate kinase activity affected treatments tissues. Cytosolic alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase significantly reduced liver treatments skeletal muscle T4 replacement thyroidectomy. results indicate SMR cardiac muscle mass lizards dependent normal thyroid function expressed maximally euthyroid animals. stimulatory effect T4 SMR thyroid-intact lizards, reported previously several investigators, nonphysiological response pharmacological T4 levels, least captive lizards. Molecular responses tissue enzyme dependent cannot generalized. Pellet implantation effective means inducing physiological increments plasma T4 replace previously used injection protocols. new method used capture-recapture experiments involving field-active lizards.
