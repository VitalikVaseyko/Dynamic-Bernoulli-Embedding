 hypothesized consumption soy protein isolate (SPI) soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) would modulate mRNA expression genes underlying lipid thyroid hormone metabolism livers small intestines young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Early pregnant rat dams placed AIN-93G diets containing casein (CAS, control protein), SPI, CAS+GEN. Litters weaned diet dam. SPI-fed (but GEN-fed) male rats 48 days age significant reductions body weight, abdominal fat pad weight hepatic content lipid droplets triglycerides. Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Ppara) transcripts elevated SPI GEN diet. Hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (Pdk4) cytochrome P450 4A10 (Cyp4a10) mRNA abundance reduced SPI; SPI effect Cyp4a10 recapitulated GEN diet. SPI (but GEN) suppressed Pdk4 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2) mRNA abundance duodenum. Liver iodothyronine deiodinase types 1 2 (Dio1 Dio2) mRNA levels increased SPI diet; effect Dio2, Dio1 mRNAs, also observed GEN. SPI GEN increased hepatic types 1 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1 D2) activities. Effects SPI GEN gene expression may contribute observed reductions body adipose tissue weight liver lipid content model. Identification regulation, genistein soy protein, iodothyronine deiodinase synthesis potential applications treatment prevention fatty liver disease obesity.
