 Leucoplasts isolated developing endosperm Ricinus communis L. import precursor small subunit ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase pea shoots process mature molecular weight (SA Boyle, SM Hemmingsen, DT Dennis [1986] Plant Physiol 81: 817-822). process requires energy form ATP. GTP, CTP, UTP inactive. ADP also satisfy energy requirement, probably action adenylate kinase envelope. Fatty acid biosynthesis occurs within leucoplasts also requires ATP maximal activity. Phosphoenolpyruvate stimulate fatty acid biosynthesis approximately three times effectively ATP generation ATP within organelle action plastid pyruvate kinase. However, phosphoenolpyruvate similar conditions stimulate uptake small subunit ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase leucoplasts. results indicate ATP required outside leucoplast protein uptake internally generated ATP effective process.
