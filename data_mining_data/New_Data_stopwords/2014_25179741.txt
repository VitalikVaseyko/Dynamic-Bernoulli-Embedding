 majority cancers demonstrate various tumor-specific metabolic aberrations, increased glycolysis even aerobic conditions (Warburg effect), whereas mitochondrial metabolic activity contribution cellular energy production restrained. One important mechanisms metabolic switch alteration abundance, utilization, localization various mitochondrial substrates. Numerous lines evidence connect disturbances mitochondrial metabolic pathways tumorigenesis provide intriguing rationale utilizing mitochondria targets anti-cancer therapy.
