 understanding control metabolic processes requires quantitative studies importance different enzymatic steps magnitude metabolic fluxes metabolite concentrations. important element studies modulation enzyme activities small steps wild-type level. review genetic approach well suited Metabolic Optimization Metabolic Control Analysis studies importance number glycolytic enzymes metabolic fluxes Lactococcus lactis. glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PEK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PYK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) shown significant control glycolytic flux exponentially growing cells L. lactis MG1363. Introduction uncoupled ATPase activity results uncoupling glycolysis biomass production. MG1363 growing defined medium supplemented glucose, ATP demanding processes significant control glycolytic flux; appears glycolysis running maximal rate. likely flux control distributed many enzymes L. lactis, cannot yet excluded one remaining glycolytic steps rate-limiting step glycolytic flux.
