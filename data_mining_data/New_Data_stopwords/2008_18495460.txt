 Among oxysterols accumulating atherosclerotic plaque, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) potent apoptotic inducer, favours myelin figure formation polar lipid accumulation. investigation performed U937 cells consisted characterizing myelin figure formation process; determining effects 7KC PI3-K/PDK-1/Akt signalling pathway; evaluating activities vitamin E (Vit-E) (alpha-tocopherol) formation myelin figures PI3-K/PDK-1/Akt signalling pathway assessing effects PI3-K inhibitors (LY-294002, 3-methyladenine) activity Vit-E cell death polar lipid accumulation. ultrastructural biochemical characteristics myelin figures (multilamellar cytoplasmic inclusions rich phospholipids 7KC present acidic vesicles reversibility alterations) support hypothesis 7KC inducer phospholipidosis. oxysterol also induces important changes lipid content and/or organization cytoplasmic membrane demonstrated merocyanine 540 fluorescence anisotropy, loss PI3-K activity dephosphorylation PDK-1 Akt. noteworthy Vit-E able counteract phospholipidosis certain apoptotic associated events (caspase activation, lysosomal degradation) restore PI3-K activity prevent PDK-1 Akt dephosphorylation. Vit-E associated LY-294002 3-methyladenine, impairment 7KC-induced apoptosis inhibited, accumulation polar lipids less counteracted. Thus, 7KC-induced apoptosis PI3-K-dependent event, Vit-E up- down-regulates PI3-K activity phospholipidosis, respectively.
