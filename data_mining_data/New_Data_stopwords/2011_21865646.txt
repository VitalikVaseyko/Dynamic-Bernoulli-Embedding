 Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) capable self-renewal differentiation foundation spermatogenesis. Although several factors important processes identified, fundamental mechanisms regulating SSC self-renewal differentiation remain unknown. Here, investigated role Foxo transcription factors mouse spermatogenesis found Foxo1 specifically marks mouse gonocytes subset spermatogonia stem cell potential. Genetic analyses showed Foxo1 required SSC homeostasis initiation spermatogenesis. Combined deficiency Foxo1, Foxo3, Foxo4 resulted severe impairment SSC self-renewal complete block differentiation, indicating Foxo3 Foxo4, although dispensable male fertility, contribute SSC function. conditional inactivation 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) phosphatase tensin homolog (Pten) male germ line, found PI3K signaling regulates Foxo1 stability subcellular localization, revealing Foxos pivotal effectors PI3K-Akt signaling SSCs. also identified network Foxo gene targets--most notably Ret--that rationalized maintenance SSCs Foxos. studies demonstrate Foxo1 expression spermatogenic lineage intimately associated stem cell state revealed believe novel Foxo-dependent mechanisms underlying SSC self-renewal differentiation, implications common diseases, including male infertility testicular cancer, due abnormalities SSC function.
