 effects ligands structure rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase studied small angle neutron scattering. radius gyration, RG, decreases 1 presence substrate phosphoenolpyruvate, increases magnitude presence allosteric inhibitor phenylalanine. increasing pH absence Mg2+ K+, RG pyruvate kinase increases. Hence, 2-A difference RG two alternative conformations. Length distribution analysis indicates that, experimental conditions increase radius gyration, pronounced increase observed probability interatomic distance 80 110 A. small angle neutron scattering results indicate "contraction" "expansion" enzyme transforms active inactive forms. Using alpha-carbon coordinates crystalline cat muscle pyruvate kinase, length distribution profile calculated, matches scattering profile inactive form. observations expected since crystals grown absence divalent cations (Stuart, D. I., Levine, M., Muirhead, H., Stammers, D. K. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 134, 109-142). Hence, results neutron scattering, x-ray crystallographic, sedimentation studies (Oberfelder, R. W., Lee, L. L.-Y., Lee, J.C. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 3813-3821) totally consistent other. aid computer modeling, crystal structure manipulated order effect changes consistent conformational change described solution scattering data. structural manipulation involves rotation B domain relative domain, leading closure cleft domains. manipulations resulted generation new sets atomic (C-alpha) coordinates, utilized calculations, result compared favorably solution data.
