 Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) nuclear deacetylase modulates lipid metabolism enhances mitochondrial activity. SIRT1 targets multiple transcription factors coactivators. Thyroid hormone (T(3)) stimulates expression hepatic genes involved mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation gluconeogenesis. reported T(3) induces genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase (cpt1a), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (pdk4), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck). SIRT1 increases expression genes via activation several factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, estrogen-related receptor alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha). Previously, reported PGC-1alpha participates T(3) induction cpt1a pdk4 liver. Given overlapping targets T(3) SIRT1, investigated whether SIRT1 participated T(3) regulation genes. Resveratrol small phenolic compound whose actions include activation SIRT1. Addition resveratrol increased T(3) induction pdk4 cpt1a genes hepatocytes. Furthermore, expression SIRT1 hepatocytes mimicked resveratrol regulation gene expression T(3). deacetylase activity SIRT1 required PGC-1alpha deacetylated following addition T(3). found SIRT1 interacted directly T(3) receptor (TRbeta). Knockdown SIRT1 decreased T(3) induction cpt1a pdk4 reduced T(3) inhibition sterol response element binding protein (srebp-1c) isolated hepatocytes rat liver. results indicate SIRT1 contributes T(3) regulation hepatic genes.
