 cancers promote ingrowth host blood vessels, resulting vascular network usually fails develop mature organization, resulting abnormal vascular dynamics stochastic variations include slowing, cessation, even reversal flow. Thus, substantial spatial temporal variations oxygen concentration commonly observed cancers. Cancer cells, like living systems, subject Darwinian dynamics survival proliferation dependent developing optimal phenotypic adaptations local environmental conditions. Here, consider environmental stresses placed tumors subject profound, frequent, stochastic variations oxygen concentration result temporal variations blood flow. vascular fluctuations undoubtedly affect local concentrations wide range molecules including growth factors (e.g., estrogen), substrate (oxygen, glucose, etc.), metabolites ([Formula: see text], focus selection forces result solely stochastic fluctuations oxygen concentration. glucose metabolism cancer cells investigated decades following observations malignant cells ferment glucose regardless oxygen concentration, condition termed Warburg effect. contrast, normal cells cease fermentation aerobic conditions physiological response termed Pasteur effect. Fermentation markedly inefficient compared cellular respiration terms adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, generating 2 ATP/glucose, whereas respiration generates 38 ATP/glucose. inefficiency requires cancer cells increase glycolytic flux, subsequently increases acid production significantly acidify local tissue. Hence, initially appears cancer cells adopt disadvantageous metabolic phenotype. Indeed, metabolic "hallmark" cancer termed "energy dysregulation." However, cancers arise evolutionary optimization process, common observed property must confer adaptive advantage. present work, investigate hypothesis aerobic glycolysis represents adaptation stochastic variations oxygen concentration stemming disordered intratumoral blood flow. Using mathematical models, demonstrate Warburg effect evolves conservative metabolic bet hedging strategy response stochastic fluctuations oxygen. Specifically, Warburg effect sacrifices fitness physoxia diverting resources efficient process respiration, preemptively adapts cells hypoxia fermentation produces ATP anaerobically. environment sufficiently stochastic fluctuations oxygen select bet hedging (Warburg) phenotype since modestly successful irrespective oxygen concentration.
