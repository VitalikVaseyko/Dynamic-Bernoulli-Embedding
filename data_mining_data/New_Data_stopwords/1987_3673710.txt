 isolated rat liver perfused usual via portal vein, joint electrical stimulation nerve fibers around artery portal vein liver hilus increased glucose output, shifted lactate uptake output, decreased urea glutamine formation well ammonia uptake, reduced ketone body production, lowered oxygen uptake reduced perfusion flow simultaneously changing intrahepatic flow distribution; accompanied overflow noradrenaline hepatic vein. effects mediated predominantly via alpha-receptors; dependent extracellular calcium. livers perfused via artery portal vein, separate stimulation plexus common hepatic artery portal vein caused similar effects glucose lactate balance perfusion flow. Arterial stimulation caused higher metabolic responses alterations arterial also 'transhepaticly' portal flow, conversely, portal flow elicited smaller metabolic responses alterations portal 'transhepaticly' arterial flow. sympathetic nerve actions blocked using alpha- beta-antagonists, resulting parasympathetic stimulation increased glucose uptake presence insulin antagonized glucagon stimulated glucose release, alone strongly presence insulin. sympathetic nerves may act directly parenchymal cells indirectly via overflow neurotransmitter vasculature sinusoids via hemodynamic changes. Experiments smooth muscle relaxant sodium nitroprusside retrograde flow indicate neither hemodynamic changes noradrenaline overflow vasculature play major role mechanism action sympathetic liver nerves glucose lactate metabolism. Comparative studies perfused livers rats, guinea pigs tupaias line view rat sympathetic nerves act via contacts periportal hepatocytes, signal propagated gap junctions, guinea pig tupaia nerves act via contacts almost parenchymal cells. Sympathetic nerve stimulation perfused rat liver caused increase activity glycogen phosphorylase decrease glycogen synthase, left activity pyruvate kinase unaltered; fructose 2,6-bisphosphate cAMP slightly enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
