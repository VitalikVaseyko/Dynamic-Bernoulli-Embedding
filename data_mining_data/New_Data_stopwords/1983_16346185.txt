 Anaerobically, Brochothrix thermosphacta fermented glucose primarily l-lactate, acetate, formate, ethanol. ratio end products varied growth conditions. presence acetate formate pH 6 increased l-lactate production glucose. Small amounts butane-2,3-diol also produced pH culture low (</=5.5) acetate added growth medium. Radioactive label [1-C]acetate incorporated ethanol l-lactate, implying reversibility pyruvate-formate lyase. crude extracts, following enzymes involved pyruvate metabolism demonstrated: lactate dehydrogenase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (coenzyme acetylating), ethanol dehydrogenase, pH 6 acetolactate-forming enzyme, diacetyl (acetoin) reductase. lactate dehydrogenase require fructose-1,6-disphosphate Mn activity.
