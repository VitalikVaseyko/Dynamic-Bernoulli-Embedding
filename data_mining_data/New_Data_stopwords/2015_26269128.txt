 120 types brain tumor approximately 45% primary brain tumors gliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) common aggressive median survival rate 14 months. Despite progress knowledge, current therapies unable effectively combat primary brain tumors patient survival remains poor. Tumor metabolism important consider therapeutic approaches focus numerous research investigations. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) cytosolic enzyme, predominantly involved anaerobic aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect); however, multiple additional functions non-neoplastic neoplastic tissues, commonly known discussed. review summarizes currently known function LDHA identifies areas would benefit exploration. current knowledge role LDHA brain potential therapeutic target brain tumors also highlighted. Warburg effect appears universal tumors, including primary brain tumors, LDHA (because involvement process) identified potential therapeutic target. Currently, are, however, suitable LDHA inhibitors available tumor therapies clinic.
