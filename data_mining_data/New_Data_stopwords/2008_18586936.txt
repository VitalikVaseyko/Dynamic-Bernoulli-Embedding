 transcriptional regulator CcpN Bacillus subtilis recently characterized repressor two gluconeogenic genes, gapB pckA, small noncoding regulatory RNA, sr1, involved arginine catabolism. Deletion ccpN impairs growth glucose strongly alters distribution intracellular fluxes, rerouting main glucose catabolism glycolysis pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. Using transcriptome analysis, show growth glucose, gapB pckA protein-coding genes directly repressed CcpN. quantifying intracellular fluxes deletion mutants, demonstrate derepression pckA glycolytic condition causes growth defect observed ccpN mutant due extensive futile cycling pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase. Beyond ATP dissipation via cycle, PckA activity causes drain tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, show main reason reduced growth ccpN mutant. high flux PP pathway ccpN mutant modulated flux alternative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, GapA GapB. Strongly increased concentrations intermediates upper glycolysis indicate GapB overexpression causes metabolic jamming pathway and, consequently, increases relative flux PP pathway. contrast, derepression sr1, third known target CcpN, plays marginal role ccpN mutant phenotypes.
