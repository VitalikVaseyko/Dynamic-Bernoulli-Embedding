 surveyed BALB/cHeA mouse, lacks cytosolic glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme catalyzes reaction glycerol phosphate shuttle. enzyme shuttle, mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, abundant skeletal muscle pancreatic islets suggesting shuttle's activity high tissues. Levels glycerol phosphate (low) dihydroxyacetone phosphate (high) abnormal nonislet tissue, especially skeletal muscle. Intermediates situated triose phosphates glycolysis pathway increased triose phosphates generally low, depending tissue. lactate/pyruvate ratio muscle low signifying low cytosolic NAD/NADH ratio. suggests nonfunctional glycerol phosphate shuttle caused block glycolysis step catalyzed glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. exercised, mice unable maintain normal ATP levels skeletal muscle. Blood glucose, serum insulin levels, pancreatic islet mass normal. isolated pancreatic islets insulin release, glucose metabolism ATP levels normal, lactate levels lactate/pyruvate ratios glucose load slightly abnormal. BALB/cHeA mouse maintain NAD/ NADH ratios sufficient function normally conditions, redox state normal. Glycerol phosphate apparently formed slow rate. Skeletal muscle severely affected probably dependent glycerol phosphate shuttle tissues. likely utilizes glycerol phosphate rapidly and, due absence glycerol kinase muscle, unable rapidly form glycerol phosphate glycerol. Glycerol kinase also absent pancreatic insulin cell, cell's function essentially normal probably redundancy NAD(H) shuttles.
