 Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) vascular neoplasm caused infection endothelial endothelial precursor cells Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8). Research efforts focused defining molecular events explaining KSHV promotes pathological angiogenesis KS tumor formation. mTOR/HIF-1 fundamental pathway driving processes upregulation angiogenic inflammatory proteins, including VEGF, ANGPTL4, ANGPT2. Interestingly, HIF-1 also implicated upregulation metabolic genes associated aerobic glycolysis growth solid tumors. However, whether HIF-1 plays role regulating cell metabolism KS remains unexplored. Here, show HIF-1 metabolic effector, pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), upregulated upon KSHV infection endothelial cells necessary maintain aerobic glycolysis infected cells. demonstrate PKM2 regulates KS angiogenic phenotype acting coactivator HIF-1 increasing levels HIF-1 angiogenic factors, including VEGF. Indeed, inhibition PKM2 expression blocked endothelial cell migration differentiation angiogenic potential KSHV-infected cells. also investigated whether PKM2 regulates angiogenic dysregulation induced KSHV-encoded G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR), viral oncogene promotes Kaposi's sarcomagenesis upregulation HIF angiogenic factors. Interestingly, found PKM2 controls vGPCR-induced VEGF paracrine secretion vGPCR oncogenesis. findings provide molecular mechanism HIF-1 dysregulation fuels angiogenesis tumor metabolism KS support investigations therapeutic approaches targeting HIF-1 PKM2 KS treatment.
