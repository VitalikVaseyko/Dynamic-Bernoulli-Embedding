 Pyruvate kinase activity controlled tightly woven regulatory network. oncofetal isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) master regulator cancer metabolism. PKM2 engages parallel, feed-forward, positive negative feedback control contributing cancer progression. Besides metabolic role, non-metabolic functions PKM2 protein kinase transcriptional coactivator c-MYC hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha essential epidermal growth factor receptor activation-induced tumorigenesis. biochemical activities controlled shift oligomeric state PKM2 includes acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, prolyl hydroxylation sumoylation. Metabolically active PKM2 tetramer allosterically regulated responds nutritional stress signals. Metabolically inactive PKM2 dimer imported nucleus function protein kinase stimulating transcription. systems biology approach PKM2 genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome fluxome level reveals differences biomolecular structure translate global rewiring cancer metabolism. Cancer systems biology takes us beyond Warburg effect, opening unprecedented therapeutic opportunities.
