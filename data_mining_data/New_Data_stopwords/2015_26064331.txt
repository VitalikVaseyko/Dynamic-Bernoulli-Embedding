 Different BHV-1 strains, virulent IBRV LN01/08 strains attenuated vaccine strain IBRV LNM, produces different clinical immune responses; however, study differential protein expression Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells BHV-1-infection still remains unclear. Here, applied comparative proteomic strategy, based 2D MALDI-TOF/MS platforms, examine differential expression proteins MDBK cells treated treated virulent IBRV LN01/08 attenuated IBRV LNM strains. total eight differential proteins, including pyruvate kinase, heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (HSP90AA1 HSP90AB1), annexin A, albumin (ALB), scinderin (SCIN), tubulin (alpha 1a) vimentin (VIM), identified. Among proteins, pyruvate kinase, HSP90 (HSP90AB1), tubulin vimentin identified virulent IBRV LN01/08 strain group, identified attenuated IBRV LNM group. results play important role tumor formation development, cell migration, tumor cell line apoptosis, cell invasion viral infection. HSP90 (HSP90AA1) protein identified control group attenuated IBRV LNM-infected group. studies shown HSP90 proteins cancer gene target, inhibiting function would result oncogene degradation cancer treatment. hand, ALB associated cell differentiation, apoptosis, necrosis, cell death, viral infection, autophagy, interstitial tissue inflammation, cell survival. results provide theoretical basis systematic understanding BHV-1-infection mechanisms BHV-1-induced immune responses.
