 competition plot method determining whether two enzyme-catalysed reactions occur active site. plot total rate p, p varies 0 1 specifies concentrations (1-p)a0 pb0 two substrates terms reference concentrations a0 b0 chosen give rates p = 0 p = 1. two substrates react site, competition plot gives horizontal straight line, i.e. total rate independent p. Independent reactions two separate sites give curve maximum; separate reactions cross-inhibition generate curves either maxima minima according whether Michaelis constants two substrates smaller larger inhibition constants reactions. Although ambiguous results sometimes arise, experimental strategies exist avoiding them, example working close possible lower two limiting rates. tested yeast hexokinase, plot indicated phosphorylation glucose fructose site. Conversely, mixture yeast hexokinase galactokinase indicated phosphorylation glucose galactose different sites. cases observed behaviour agreed known properties enzymes. slight modification definition plot allows applied also enzymes deviate Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
