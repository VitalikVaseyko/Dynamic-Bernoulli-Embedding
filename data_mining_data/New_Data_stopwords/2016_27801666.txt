 M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) contributes Warburg effect. However, remains unknown whether PKM2 inhibitory effect mitochondrial function. report work PKM2 overexpression inhibits expression Drp1 results mitochondrial fusion. ATP production found decreased, mtDNA copy number elevated expression level electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, III, V depressed PKM2 overexpressed cells. PKM2 overexpression showed decreased p53 protein level shorter p53 half-life. contrast, PKM2 knockdown resulted increased p53 expression prolonged half-life p53. PKM2 could directly bind p53 MDM2 promote MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. dimeric PKM2 significantly suppressed p53 expression compared PKM2 mutants. reverse relationship PKM2 Drp1 confirmed large number clinical samples. Taken together, present results highlight new mechanism link PKM2 mitochondrial function, based p53-Drp1 axis regulation, revealing novel therapeutic target patients abnormal mitochondria.
