 Metabolic change one hallmarks tumor, recently attracted great attention. One main metabolic characteristics tumor cells high level glycolysis even presence oxygen, known aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. energy production much less glycolysis pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle. molecular mechanism high glycolytic flux tumor cells remains unclear. large amount intermediates derived glycolytic pathway could meet biosynthetic requirements proliferating cells. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha, PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, many factors, oncogene activation tumor suppressor inactivation, drive cancer cells favor glycolysis mitochondrial oxidation. Several small molecules targeting glycolytic pathway exhibit promising anticancer activity vitro vivo. review, focus latest progress regulation aerobic glycolysis discuss potential targets tumor therapy.
