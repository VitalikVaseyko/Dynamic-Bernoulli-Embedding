 Hyperglycemia dyslipidemia classic features diabetes mellitus (DM). study, one fraction crude polysaccharides extracted Lonicera japonica flower buds (LJP) investigated hypolipidaemic hypoglycaemic activities means streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Interestingly, orally administrated 800mg/kg body weight (B.W.) LJP 42 days, food water intake levels sugar insulin blood diabetic rats drastically decreased, contents liver skeletal muscle glycogen concentrations hepatic pyruvate kinase hexokinase obviously increased (p<0.01 p<0.05). levels total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterin (LDL-C) very-low-density lipoprotein-cholesterin (VLDL-C) significantly descended, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterin (HDL-C) significantly ascended (p<0.01 p<0.05). addition, oxidant stress liver restored well. results suggested LJP could considered ingredient functional foods diabetes, first report hypoglycemic hypolipidemic effects polysaccharides extracted Lonicera japonica.
