 Human rat erythrocytes fractionated counter-current distribution charge-sensitive dextran/poly(ethylene glycol) two-phase systems. specific activities key glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase) declined along distribution profiles, although relative positions activity profiles reversed two species. enzymes maintained normal response specific regulatory effectors cell fractions. variations observed phosphoglycerate kinase bisphosphoglycerate mutase activities. correlations enzyme activities (pyruvate kinase/hexokinase, pyruvate kinase/phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase/pyruvate kinase plus phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase phosphoglycerate kinase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase ratios) studied whole erythrocyte populations well cell fractions. results strongly support fractionation human erythrocytes according cell age, occurs rat erythrocytes.
