 actinin-associated LIM protein, ALP, prototype large family proteins containing N-terminal PDZ domain C-terminal LIM domain. PDZ-LIM proteins components muscle cytoskeleton occur along Z lines owing interaction PDZ domain spectrin-like repeats alpha-actinin. PDZ LIM domains typically found proteins mediate cellular signaling, PDZ-LIM proteins suspected participate muscle development. Interestingly ALP gene occurs 4q35 near heterochromatic region mutated facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, indicating possible role ALP disease. Here, describe generation analysis mice lacking ALP gene. Surprisingly, ALP knockout mice show gross histological abnormalities maintain sarcolemmal integrity determined serum pyruvate kinase assays. absence dystrophic phenotype mice suggests down-regulation ALP participate facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. data suggest ALP participate muscle development alternative PDZ-LIM protein compensate lack ALP.
