 Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) common paediatric soft-tissue sarcoma including two major subtypes, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Increasing evidence suggests oncogenesis RMS involves multiple stages signalling protein dysregulation may include prolonged activation serine/threonine kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) AKT. date, whether PDK-1/AKT pathway activated RMS unknown. study examine phosphorylation status AKT evaluate novel small molecular inhibitor, OSU-03012 targeting PDK-1 RMS. examined phosphorylation levels AKT using ARMS ERMS tissue microarray immunohistochemistry staining. results showed phospho-AKT(Thr308) level elevated 42 35% ARMS ERMS, respectively. Phospho-AKT(Ser473) level also increased 43% ARMS 55% ERMS. Furthermore, showed OSU-03012 inhibits cell viability induces apoptosis ARMS ERMS cell lines (RH30, SMS-CTR), express elevated phospho-AKT levels. Normal cells much less sensitive OSU-03012 detectable apoptosis observed. study showed, first time, PDK-1/AKT pathway activated RMS may play important role survival RMS. PDK-1/AKT pathway may attractive therapeutic target cancer intervention RMS using OSU-03012.
