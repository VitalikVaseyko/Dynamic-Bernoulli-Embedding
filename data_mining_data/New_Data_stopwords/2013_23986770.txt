 Phloem sap contains large repertoire macromolecules addition sugars, amino acids, growth substances ions. transcription profile melon phloem sap contains 1000 mRNA molecules, associated signal transduction, transcriptional control, stress defense responses. Heterografting experiments established long-distance trafficking numerous mRNA molecules. Interestingly, several trafficking transcripts involved auxin response, including two molecules coding auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA). explore biological role melon Aux/IAA transcript CmF-308 vascular tissue, cassette containing coding sequence gene phloem-specific promoter introduced tomato plants. number lateral roots significantly higher transgenic plants expressing CmF-308 AtSUC2 promoter controls. similar effect root development obtained transient expression CmF-308 source leaves N. benthamiana plants. auxin-response assay showed CmF-308-transgenic roots sensitive auxin control roots. addition altered root development, phloem-specific expression CmF-308 resulted shorter plants, higher number lateral shoots delayed flowering, phenotype resembling reduced apical dominance. contrast root response, cotyledons transgenic plants less sensitive auxin control cotyledons. reduced auxin sensitivity shoot tissue confirmed lower relative expression several Aux/IAA genes leaves increase relative expression cytokinin-response regulator, TRR8/9b. accumulated data suggest expression Aux/IAA phloem modifies auxin sensitivity tissue-specific manner, thereby altering plant development.
