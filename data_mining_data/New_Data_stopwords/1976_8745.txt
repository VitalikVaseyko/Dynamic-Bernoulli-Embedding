 circadian rhythms liver glycogen, plasma glucose, corticosterone insulin, hepatic activity PK, G6PDH, ME, Ac, CoA carbox. PEP-CK GPT studied adult rats. Animals either received mixed diet ad libitum (8% protein) protein meal (1.1 g protein) given 05:00 17:00 h, free access protein-free diet (separately fed). protein meal ingested lighted period (17:00) 24-hour average level liver PEP-CK greater rats consuming protein darkness (05:00). latter case, modification circadian rhythm liver glycogen circadian rhythm liver PK, G6PDH, Ac.CoA carbox. activity (increase 24 h average level, extension period high activity, sudden increase ingestion protein meal) observed. Conversely, circadian rhythm plasma insulin corticosterone liver PEP-CK GPT activity slightly affected mode feeding.
