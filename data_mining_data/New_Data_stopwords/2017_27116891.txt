 evident metabolic machinery stem cells fairly different differentiated neurons, basic energy production pathways neural stem cells (NSCs) neurons far clear. Using model vitro neuron production NE-4C NSCs, study focused metabolic changes taking place vitro neuronal differentiation. O2 consumption, H(+) production, metabolic responses single metabolites measured cultures NSCs neuronal derivatives, well primary neuronal astroglial cultures. metabolite-free solutions, NSCs consumed little O2 displayed higher level mitochondrial proton leak neurons. stem cells, glycolysis main source energy survival 2.5-h period metabolite deprivation. contrast, stem cell-derived primary neurons sustained high-level oxidative phosphorylation metabolite deprivation, indicating consumption cellular material energy production. stem cells increased O2 consumption mitochondrial ATP production response single metabolites (with exception glucose), showing rapid adaptation metabolic machinery available resources. contrast, single metabolites increase O2 consumption neurons astrocytes. "starving" neurons, neither lactate pyruvate utilized mitochondrial ATP production. Gene expression studies also suggested aerobic glycolysis rapid metabolic adaptation characterize NE-4C NSCs, autophagy alternative glucose utilization play important roles metabolism stem cell-derived neurons.
