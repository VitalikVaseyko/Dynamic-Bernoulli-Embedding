 Alveolar type II (ATII) cells cultured air-liquid (A/L) interface maintain differentiation, lose properties submerged. Others showed oxygen tension gradient develops culture medium ATII cells consume oxygen. Therefore, wondered whether hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling could explain differences phenotypes ATII cells cultured A/L interface submerged conditions. ATII cells isolated male Sprague-Dawley rats cultured inserts coated mixture rat-tail collagen Matrigel, medium including 5% rat serum 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor, apical surfaces either exposed air submerged. A/L interface condition maintained expression surfactant proteins, whereas expression down-regulated submerged condition, effect rapid reversible. submerged conditions, increase HIF1alpha HIF2alpha nuclear extracts, mRNA levels HIF inducible genes, vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), protein level pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme-1. expression surfactant proteins suppressed GLUT1 mRNA levels induced cells cultured 1 mM dimethyloxalyl glycine. expression surfactant proteins restored submerged conditions supplemented 60% oxygen. HIF signaling oxygen tension surface cells appears important regulating phenotype rat ATII cells.
