 ability various ligands modulate binding fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) purified rat liver pyruvate kinase examined. Binding Fru-1,6-P2 pyruvate kinase exhibits positive cooperativity, maximum binding 4 mol Fru-1,6-P2 per enzyme tetramer. Hill coefficient (nH), concentration Fru-1,6-P2 giving half-maximal binding [FBP]1/2, influenced several factors. 150 mM Tris-HCl, 70 mM KCl, 11 mM MgSO4 pH 7.4, [FBP]1/2 2.6 microM nH 2.7. Phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate enhance binding Fru-1,6-P2 decreasing [FBP]1/2. ADP ATP alone little influence Fru-1,6-P2 binding. However, nucleotides antagonize response elicited pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate, suggesting competent enzyme substrate complex favor Fru-1,6-P2 binding. Phosphorylation pyruvate kinase inclusion alanine medium, two actions inhibit enzyme activity, result diminished binding low concentrations Fru-1,6-P2 enzyme. effectors alter maximum binding capacity enzyme rather raise concentrations Fru-1,6-P2 needed maximum binding. Phosphorylation also decreased nH Fru-1,6-P2 binding 2.7 1.7. Pyruvate kinase activity dependent divalent metal ion. Substituting Mn2+ Mg2+ results 60% decrease maximum catalytic activity enzyme decreases concentration phosphoenolpyruvate needed half-maximal activity 1 0.1 mM. consequence, Mn2+ stimulates activity subsaturating concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, inhibits saturating concentrations substrate presence Fru-1,6-P2. Mg2+ Mn2+ diminish binding low concentrations Fru-1,6-P2; however, concentrations metal ions needed influence Fru-1,6-P2 binding exceed needed support catalytic activity.
