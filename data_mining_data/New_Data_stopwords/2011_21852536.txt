 Loss extracellular matrix (ECM) attachment leads metabolic impairments limit cellular energy production. Characterization metabolic alterations induced ECM detachment revealed dramatic decrease uptake glucose, glutamine, pyruvate, consequent decrease flux glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, flux pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) disproportionally decreased, concomitant increased expression PDH inhibitory kinase, PDH kinase 4 (PDK4), increased carbon secretion. Overexpression ErbB2 maintains PDH flux suppressing PDK4 expression Erk-dependent manner, Erk signaling also regulates PDH flux ECM-attached cells. Additionally, epidermal growth factor (EGF), potent inducer Erk, positively regulates PDH flux decreased PDK4 expression. Furthermore, overexpression PDK4 ECM-detached cells suppresses ErbB2-mediated rescue ATP levels, attached cells, PDK4 overexpression decreases PDH flux, de novo lipogenesis, cell proliferation. Mining microarray data human tumor data sets revealed PDK4 mRNA commonly down-regulated tumors compared tissues origin. results identify novel mechanism ECM attachment, growth factors, oncogenes modulate metabolic fate glucose controlling PDK4 expression PDH flux influence proliferation.
