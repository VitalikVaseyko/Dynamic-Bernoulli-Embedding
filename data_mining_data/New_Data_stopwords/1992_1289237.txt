 hypoglycemic effect Bordetella pertussis (Challenge strain No.18323) purified cell extract (protein traces carbohydrates, 2 mg%) administered (0.1 mg/100 g body wt. i.v.) mice activities key regulatory enzymes, viz. glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) lactate dehydrogenase, glycolytic pathway liver studied varying intervals injection. maximum hypoglycaemic effect observed end 12 hr, activities enzymes studied showed significant enhancement 18 hr, thus suggesting increased glucose utilization towards formation pyruvate. Actinomycin found inhibit stimulation G-6-PD activity B. pertussis treated animals, thereby indicating role B. pertussis synthesis enzyme.
