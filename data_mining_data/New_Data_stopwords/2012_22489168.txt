 Autophagy highly regulated intracellular process involved turnover cellular constituents maintenance cellular homeostasis. study, show activity autophagy increases H(2)O(2) RasV12-induced senescent fibroblasts. Inhibiting autophagy promotes cell apoptosis senescent cells, suggesting autophagy activation plays cytoprotective role. Furthermore, data indicate increase autophagy senescent cells linked activation transcription factor FoxO3A, blocks ATP generation transcriptionally up-regulating expression PDK4, inhibitor pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thus leading AMPK activation mTOR inhibition. findings suggest novel mechanism FoxO3A factors activate autophagy via metabolic alteration.
