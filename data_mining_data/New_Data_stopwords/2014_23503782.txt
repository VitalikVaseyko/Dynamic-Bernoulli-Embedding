 Mitochondrial porins voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) main route solute transport outer mitochondrial membranes (OMM). mammals, hexokinase (HK) binds VDAC, allows channeling ATP synthesized oxidative phosphorylation toward HK. plants, although HK found associated OMM, evidence interaction VDAC scarce. Thus, work, studied physical functional interaction proteins beetroot mitochondria. observe physical interaction HK VDAC, OMM presenting HK activity prepared purified mitochondria. Protein complexes solubilized OMM mild detergents separated centrifugation glycerol gradients. HK activity immunodetected VDAC found small (9S-13S) large (>40S) complexes. OMM proteins also separated according hydropathy serial phase partitioning Triton X-114. HK activity found hydrophobic fractions VDAC also present. results indicated HK could bound VDAC beetroot mitochondria. functional interaction HK VDAC demonstrated observing effect apyrase HK-catalyzed glucose phosphorylation intact mitochondria. Apyrase, hydrolyzes freely soluble ATP, competed efficiently hexokinase ATP produced outside mitochondria (with PEP pyruvate kinase), produced inside mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation. results suggest HK closely interacts VDAC beetroot mitochondria, interaction allows channeling respiratory ATP toward HK VDAC.
