 Alternative splicing pyruvate kinase gene (PK-M) generate M2 isoform promote aerobic glycolysis tumor growth. However, cancer-specific alternative splicing regulation PK-M completely understood. Here, demonstrate PK-M regulated reciprocal effects mutually exclusive exons 9 10, exon 9 repressed exon 10 activated cancer cells. Strikingly, exonic, rather intronic, cis-elements key determinants PK-M splicing isoform ratios. Using systematic sub-exonic duplication approach, identify potent exonic splicing enhancer exon 10, differs homologous counterpart exon 9 two nucleotides. identify SRSF3 one cognate factors, show serine/arginine-rich protein activates exon 10 mediates changes glucose metabolism. findings provide mechanistic insights complex regulation alternative splicing key regulator Warburg effect, also implications genes similar pattern alternative splicing.
