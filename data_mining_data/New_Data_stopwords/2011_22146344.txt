 Previous studies demonstrated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) enhance cell survival upregulation secretion stanniocalcin-1 (STC1). study shows MSC-derived STC1 promotes survival lung cancer cells uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), shifting metabolism towards glycolytic metabolic profile. MSC-derived STC1 upregulated uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) injured A549 cells STC1-dependent manner. Knockdown UCP2 reduced ability MSCs recombinant STC1 (rSTC1) reduce cell death A549 population. rSTC1-treated A549 cells displayed decreased levels ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased lactate production, dependent upregulation UCP2. data suggest MSCs promote cell survival regulating mitochondrial respiration via STC1.
