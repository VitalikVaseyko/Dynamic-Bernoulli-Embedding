 Rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase phosphorylated vitro Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase purified rabbit liver. calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinase catalyzed incorporation 1.7 mol 32P/mol pyruvate kinase subunit; maximum phosphorylation associated 3.0-fold increase K0.5 P-enolpyruvate. compares incorporation 0.7 1.0 mol 32P/mol catalyzed cAMP-dependent protein kinase 2-fold increase K0.5 P-enolpyruvate. [32P]pyruvate kinase, phosphorylated CaM-dependent protein kinase, subsequently incubated 5 mM ADP cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kinase reversal conditions), 50-60% 32PO4 removed pyruvate kinase, K0.5 P-enolpyruvate decreased 20-30%. Identification 32P-amino acids partial acid hydrolysis showed CaM-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated threonyl seryl residues (ratio 1:2, respectively) whereas cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated seryl groups. two phosphorylation sites present 3-4-kDa CNBr fragment located near amino terminus enzyme subunit. results indicate CaM-dependent protein kinase catalyzed phosphorylation L-type pyruvate kinase two discrete sites. One site apparently serine phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase. second site unique threonine residue whose phosphorylation also inactivates pyruvate kinase elevating K0.5 P-enolpyruvate. results may account Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation pyruvate kinase observed isolated hepatocytes.
