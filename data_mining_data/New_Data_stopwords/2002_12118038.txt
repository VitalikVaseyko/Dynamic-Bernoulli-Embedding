 Ablation peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, lipid-activated transcription factor regulates expression beta-oxidative genes, results profound metabolic abnormalities liver heart. present study used PPAR alpha knockout (KO) mice determine whether transcription factor essential regulating fuel metabolism skeletal muscle. animals challenged exhaustive exercise starvation, KO mice exhibited lower serum levels glucose, lactate, ketones higher nonesterified fatty acids wild type (WT) littermates. exercise, KO mice exhausted earlier WT exhibited greater rates glycogen depletion liver skeletal muscle. Fatty acid oxidative capacity similar muscles WT KO animals fed 28% lower KO muscles animals starved. Exercise-induced regulation starvation-induced regulation pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 uncoupling protein 3, two classical robustly responsive PPAR alpha target genes, similar WT KO skeletal muscle markedly different genotypes heart. Real time quantitative PCR analyses showed unlike liver heart, mouse skeletal muscle PPAR delta severalfold abundant either PPAR alpha PPAR gamma. human rodent myocytes, highly selective PPAR delta agonist GW742 increased fatty acid oxidation 2-fold induced expression several lipid regulatory genes, including pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 uncoupling protein 3, responses similar elicited PPAR alpha agonist GW647. results show redundancy functions PPARs alpha delta transcriptional regulators fatty acid homeostasis suggest skeletal muscle high levels delta-subtype compensate deficiency PPAR alpha.
