 BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes results destruction pancreatic beta-cell consequence autoimmune process. date, information properties islets isolated type 1 diabetic patients scant. METHODS: immunological functional properties islets prepared pancreas type 1 diabetic patients studied shortly isolation period culture euglycemic condition. RESULTS: Compared control islets, freshly prepared type 1 diabetic islets released significantly higher amount cytokines (pg/mL) culture medium (TNF-alpha: 112.9 +/- 5.6 vs 75.6 +/- 24.4; INF-gamma: 286.9 +/- 26.9 vs 58.6 +/- 6.2; IL-10: 41.8 +/- 4.3 vs 10.1 +/- 3.2; TGF-1 beta: 294.0 +/- 20.6 vs 45.1 +/- 3.5); significantly higher chemotactic index (1.9 +/- 0.2 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1); showed reduced insulin release (% insulin content) response glucose (2.8 +/- 0.7 vs 5.3 +/- 1.9), arginine (3.0 +/- 0.6 vs 5.6 +/- 1.0), glibenclamide (2.9 +/- 0.7 vs 5.4 +/- 0.9); exhibited decreased glucose oxidation capability diminished mRNA expression glucokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, mitochondrial glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase. Ten days isolation, normalization cytokine release (TNF-alpha: 55.7 +/- 2.3; INF-gamma: 53.9 +/- 4.3; IL-10: 8.6 +/- 0.7; TGF-1 beta: 60.7 +/- 12.4) chemotactic index (1.3 +/- 0.2) observed. Moreover, improvement insulin secretion (3.8 +/- 0.3, 4.7 +/- 0.6 3.5 +/- 0.2 respectively response glucose, arginine, glibenclamide) glucose oxidation, partial recovery measured mRNA expressions. CONCLUSIONS: novel results, obtained islets prepared patients type 1 diabetes, demonstrate even months diabetes diagnosis, period culture islets favorable environment beneficial effects islet function.
