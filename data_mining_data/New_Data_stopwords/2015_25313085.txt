 Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) alternatively spliced variant pyruvate kinase gene preferentially expressed embryonic development cancer cells. PKM2 alters final rate-limiting step glycolysis, resulting cancer-specific Warburg effect (also referred aerobic glycolysis). Although previous reports suggest PKM2 functions nonmetabolic transcriptional regulation, significance cancer biology remains elusive. report stimulation epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) results nuclear translocation PKM2 colon cancer cells, pivotal promoting EMT. Immunoprecipitation LC-electrospray ionized TOF MS analyses revealed EMT stimulation causes direct interaction PKM2 nucleus TGF-beta-induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2), transcriptional cofactor repressor TGF-beta signaling. binding PKM2 TGIF2 recruits histone deacetylase 3 E-cadherin promoter sequence, subsequent deacetylation histone H3 suppression E-cadherin transcription. previously unidentified finding molecular interaction PKM2 nucleus sheds light significance PKM2 expression cancer cells.
