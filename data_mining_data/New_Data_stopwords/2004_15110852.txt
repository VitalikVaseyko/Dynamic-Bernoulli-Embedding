 PDHK highly specific enzyme, inhibits PDC thereby reducing conversion pyruvate AcetylCoA leading increased glucose lactate level contributing various pathological disease states. 3D-QSAR CoMFA studies performed diverse PDHK inhibitors based maximum common substructural alignments different classes molecules selected reference molecule using divide conquer strategy. Statistically robust CoMFA model obtained cross-validated correlation coefficient 0.561 conventional correlation coefficient 0.990. Predictive correlation coefficient r2(pred) found 0.875.
