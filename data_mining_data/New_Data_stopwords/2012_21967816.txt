 Insulin resistance defining feature metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes mellitus also may occur independently conditions. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic manifestation disorders, increases risk hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, mechanisms linking hyperinsulinemia NAFLD HCC require clarification. describe novel model primary insulin resistance HCC strong parent-of-origin effects. Male AB6F1 (A/JCr dam x C57BL/6 sire) B6AF1 (B6 dam x A/J sire) mice developed spontaneous insulin resistance, NAFLD, HCC without obesity diabetes. survey mitochondrial, imprinted, sex-linked traits revealed modest associations X-linked genes. However, diet-induced obesity study, including B6.A chromosome substitution-strain (consomic) mice, showed segregation sex chromosome. Thus, parent-of-origin effects specified within autosomal genome. Next, interrogated mechanisms insulin-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Steatotic hepatocytes exhibited adipogenic transition characterized vacuolar metaplasia up-regulation vimentin, adipsin, fatty acid translocase (CD36), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, related products. profile largely recapitulated insulin-supplemented primary mouse hepatocyte cultures. Importantly, pyruvate kinase M2, fetal anabolic enzyme implicated Warburg effect, activated insulin vivo vitro. Thus, study reveals parent-of-origin effects heritable insulin resistance, implicating adipogenic transition acquired anabolic metabolism progression NAFLD HCC.
