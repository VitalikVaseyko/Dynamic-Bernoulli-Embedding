 ability animal depress ATP turnover maintaining metabolic energy balance important survival hypoxia. present study, investigated responses cardiac energy metabolism performance hypoxia-tolerant tilapia (Oreochromis hybrid sp.) exposure environmental hypoxia. Exposure graded hypoxia (> =92% 2.5% air saturation 3.6 +/- 0.2 h) followed exposure 5% air saturation 8 h caused depression whole animal oxygen consumption rate accompanied parallel decreases heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac power output (CPO, analogous ATP demand heart). cardiac parameters remained depressed 50-60% compared normoxic values throughout 8-h exposure. 24-h exposure 5% air saturation, cardiac ATP concentration unchanged compared normoxia anaerobic glycolysis contributed ATP supply evidenced considerable accumulation lactate heart plasma. Reductions provision aerobic substrates apparent large rapid (in <1 h) decrease plasma nonesterified fatty acids concentration modest decrease activity pyruvate dehydrogenase. Depression cardiac ATP demand via bradycardia associated decrease CPO appears integral component hypoxia-induced metabolic rate depression tilapia likely contributes hypoxic survival.
