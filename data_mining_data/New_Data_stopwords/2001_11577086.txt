 L6 skeletal muscle cells immortalized hepatocytes, insulin induced 2-fold increase activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. effect almost completely blocked protein kinase C (PKC) delta inhibitor Rottlerin PKCdelta antisense oligonucleotides. variance, overexpression wild-type PKCdelta active PKCdelta mutant induced PDH complex activity L6 liver cells. Insulin stimulation activity PDH complex accompanied 2.5-fold increase PDH phosphatases 1 2 (PDP1/2) activity change activity PDH kinase. PKCdelta antisense blocked insulin activation PDP1/2, PDH. insulin-exposed cells, PDP1/2 activation paralleled activation mitochondrial translocation PKCdelta, revealed cell subfractionation confocal microscopy studies. mitochondrial translocation PKCdelta, like activation, prevented Rottlerin. extracts insulin-stimulated cells, PKCdelta co-precipitated PDP1/2. PKCdelta also bound PDP1/2 overlay blots, suggesting direct PKCdelta-PDP interaction may occur vivo well. intact cells, insulin exposure determined PDP1/2 phosphorylation, specifically prevented PKCdelta antisense. PKCdelta also phosphorylated PDP vitro, followed PDP1/2 activation. Thus, muscle liver cells, insulin causes activation mitochondrial translocation PKCdelta, accompanied PDP phosphorylation activation. events necessary insulin activation PDH complex cells.
