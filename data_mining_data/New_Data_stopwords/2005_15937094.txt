 Circadian clocks intracellular molecular mechanisms allow cell anticipate time day. previously reported intact rat heart expresses major components circadian clock, rhythmic expression vivo consistent operation fully functional clock mechanism. present study exposes oscillations circadian clock genes [brain arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (bmal1), reverse strand c-erbaalpha gene (rev-erbaalpha), period 2 (per2), albumin D-element binding protein (dbp)] isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes culture. Acute (2 h) and/or chronic (continuous) treatment cardiomyocytes FCS (50% 2.5%, respectively) results rhythmic expression circadian clock genes periodicities 20-24 h. contrast, cardiomyocytes cultured absence serum exhibit dramatically dampened oscillations bmal1 dbp only. Zeitgebers (timekeepers) factors influence timing circadian clock. Glucose, previously shown reactivate circadian clock gene oscillations fibroblasts, effect expression circadian clock genes adult rat cardiomyocytes, either absence presence serum. Exposure adult rat cardiomyocytes sympathetic neurotransmitter norephinephrine (10 microM) 2 h reinitiates rhythmic expression circadian clock genes serum-independent manner. Oscillations circadian clock genes associated 24-h oscillations metabolic genes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (pdk4) uncoupling protein 3 (ucp3). conclusion, data suggest circadian clock operates within myocytes heart molecular mechanism persists standard cell culture conditions (i.e., 2.5% serum). Furthermore, data suggest norepinephrine, unlike glucose, influences timing circadian clock within heart circadian clock may novel mechanism regulating myocardial metabolism.
