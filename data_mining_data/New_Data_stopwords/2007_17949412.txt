 study examines role c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitochondrial signaling bioenergetics primary cortical neurons isolated rat brain mitochondria. Exposure neurons either anisomycin (an activator JNK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases) H2O2 resulted activation (phosphorylation) JNK (mostly p46(JNK1)) translocation mitochondria. Experiments mitochondria isolated either rat brain primary cortical neurons incubated proteinase K revealed phosphorylated JNK associated outer mitochondrial membrane; association resulted phosphorylation E(1alpha) subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase, key enzyme catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate links two major metabolic pathways: glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle. JNK-mediated phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase observed experiments carried mitoplasts, thus suggesting requirement intact, functional mitochondria effect. JNK-mediated phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase associated decline activity and, consequently, shift anaerobic pyruvate metabolism: latter confirmed increased accumulation lactic acid decreased overall energy production (ATP levels). Pyruvate dehydrogenase appears specific phosphorylation target JNK, kinases, protein kinase protein kinase C elicit pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphorylation decrease activity complex. results suggest JNK mediates signaling pathway regulates metabolic functions mitochondria part network coordinates cytosolic mitochondrial processes relevant cell function.
