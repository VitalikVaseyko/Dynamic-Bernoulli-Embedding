 Despite effective use antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) epilepsy, therapeutic failure occurs 30% patients. Novel approaches targeting inhibition epileptogenesis. N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) indoleamine produced mainly pineal gland, observed exhibit antiepileptic neuroprotective effects experimental clinical investigations. present study, underlying protective mechanism melatonin neonatal seizure-induced long-term excitotoxicity examined hippocampus rats, predominantly metabolism-associated genes. Sprague Dawley rats (6-day-old; P6) randomly divided four groups, control (Cont), melatonin-treated control (Mel), recurrent neonatal seizure (RS) treatment melatonin RS combined (Mel+RS). P35, mossy fiber sprouting changes gene expression hippocampus assessed using Timm staining, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction use 2(-DeltaCT) methods, respectively. aberrant mossy fiber sprouting supra granular region dentate gyrus CA3 subfield hippocampus suppressed pretreatment melatonin. addition, among nineteen genes identified, four energy metabolism-associated genes (Kcnj11, leptin receptor, dopamine receptor D2 melanocortin 4 receptor), four lipid metabolism-associated genes (apolipoprotein A-I, opioid receptor kappa 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 cytochrome P450, family 46, subfamily a, polypeptide 1) zinc transporter 1 (ZnT1), sphingomyelinase (nSMase) Cathepsin-E, markedly downregulated melatonin treatment Mel group developmental seizure RS Mel + RS groups, compared Cont group. Furthermore, melatonin-pretreated seizure rats (Mel + RS) exhibited significantly upregulated expression calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha), acetyl-Coenzyme acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), ZnT-1, metallothionein 1 (MT-1), nSMase Cathepsin-E, compared RS rats. Thus, present study investigated changes expression metabolic genes hippocampus following pretreatment melatonin. Fluorthyl-induced decreases expression levels ACAT1/nSMase/Cathepsin-E, ZnT-1/MT-1 CaMKIIalpha hippocampus, reversal melatonin may associated decrease neonatal seizure-induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, requires investigation.
