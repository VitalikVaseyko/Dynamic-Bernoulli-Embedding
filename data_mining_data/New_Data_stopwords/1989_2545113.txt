 Enzymes assayed HPLC calculating amount substrate(s) left over, product formed, peak area ratios suitable internal standard. However, sometimes substrates used contaminated small amounts products lead errors determination enzyme activity. method HPLC test enzymes, prevents eventual errors, uses ratio substrate/product time zero internal standard kinetics followed aid simple mathematical equation. approach applied determination activities papain, urokinase, NAD glycohydrolase, pyruvate kinase samples compared data obtained internal standard method, giving reproducible results cases.
