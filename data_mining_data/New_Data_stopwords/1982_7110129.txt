 influence dexamethasone isozyme patterns ATP-hexose phosphotransferases, aldolase pyruvate kinase adult rat hepatocytes maintained primary cultures studied. progressive loss typical adult liver isozymes glucokinase, pyruvate kinase L aldolase B, simultaneous increase pyruvate kinase hexokinase activities, observed hepatocytes cultured absence added glucocorticoid. culture medium supplemented 10(-7)M dexamethasone, adult liver patterns pyruvate kinase aldolase preserved least seven days culture, initial level glucokinase maintained three days, rise hexokinase activity delayed partially blocked. results discussed relation known beneficial effect glucocorticoids survival cultured hepatocytes.
