 expression aldolase B isoenzyme transcripts confirmed RT-PCR rat kidney cell distribution compared characteristic enzymes gluconeogenic glycolytic metabolic pathway: fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase (PK). detected aldolase isoenzyme thin limb collecting ducts medulla distal tubules glomerula cortex. pattern distribution found PK, aldolase B, PEPCK, FBPase. addition, co-localization studies confirmed aldolase B, FBPase, PEPCK expressed proximal cells. segregated cell distribution aldolase B key glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes, respectively, suggests aldolase isoenzymes participate different metabolic pathways. order test FBPase interacts aldolase B, FBPase immobilized agarose subjected binding experiments. results show aldolase B specifically bound FBPase interaction specifically disrupted 60 microM Fru-1,6-P2. data indicate presence modulated enzyme-enzyme interaction FBPase isoenzyme B. affirm kidney, aldolase B specifically participates, along gluconeogenic pathway aldolase glycolysis.
