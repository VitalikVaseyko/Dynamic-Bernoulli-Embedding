 Escherichia coli strains VH33 (PTS(-) GalP(+) strain displaying strongly reduced overflow metabolism) VH34 (additionally lacking pyruvate kinase A) evaluated production plasmid DNA (pDNA) vaccine. parent (W3110) mutant strains cultured using 10 g glucose/L. specific growth rates three strains similar, presented differences accumulation acetate. W3110 accumulated 4 g/L acetate, VH33 produced 1.4 g/L, VH34 0.78 g/L. VH33 VH34 produced 76% 300% pDNA W3110. Moreover, VH34 demanded 33% less oxygen VH33 W3110, advantageous large-scale applications.
