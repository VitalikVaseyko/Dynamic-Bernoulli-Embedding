 Increases glucose concentration control transcription preproinsulin (PPI) gene several genes pancreatic islet beta-cell. Although recent data demonstrated secreted insulin may regulate PPI gene (Leibiger, I. B., Leibiger, B., Moede, T., Berggren, P. O. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 933-938), role insulin control beta-cell genes unexplored. study importance insulin secretion regulation PPI liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) genes glucose, used intranuclear microinjection promoter-luciferase constructs MIN6 beta-cells photon-counting imaging. activity promoter increased either 30 (versus 3) mm glucose 1-20 nm insulin. effects insulin due enhanced glucose metabolism since culture hormone impact stimulation increases intracellular ATP concentration caused 30 mm glucose. Furthermore, islet-specific glucokinase promoter cellular glucokinase immunoreactivity unaffected 30 mm glucose 20 nm insulin. Inhibition insulin secretion Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil, ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener diazoxide, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine blocked effects glucose L-PK gene transcription. Similarly, 30 mm glucose failed induce promoter inhibition phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity LY294002 expression dominant negative-acting phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (Deltap85) phosphoinositide 3'-phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase tensin homologue). LY294002 also diminished activation L-PK gene caused inhibition 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase anti-5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha2 antibodies. Conversely, stimulation insulin secretion 13 mm KCl 10 microm tolbutamide strongly activated PPI L-PK promoters. data indicate that, MIN6 beta-cells, stimulation insulin secretion important activation glucose L-PK well PPI promoter, cause increases glucokinase gene expression glucose metabolism.
