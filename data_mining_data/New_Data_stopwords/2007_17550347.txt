 Obesity diabetes associated increased fatty acid availability excess muscle fatty acid oxidation capacity. mismatch implicated pathogenesis cardiac contractile dysfunction also development skeletal-muscle insulin resistance. tested hypothesis 'Western' high fat diets differentially cause maladaptation cardiac- skeletal-muscle fatty acid oxidation, resulting cardiac contractile dysfunction. Wistar rats fed low fat, 'Western' high fat (10, 45 60% calories fat respectively) diet acute (1 day 1 week), short (4-8 weeks), intermediate (16-24 weeks) long (32-48 weeks) term. Oleate oxidation heart muscle ex vivo increased high fat diet time points investigated. contrast, cardiac oleate oxidation increased Western diet acute, short intermediate term, long term. Consistent fatty acid oxidation maladaptation, cardiac power decreased long-term Western diet only. contrast, soleus muscle oleate oxidation (ex vivo) increased acute short term either Western high fat feeding. Fatty acid-responsive genes, including PDHK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) CTE1 (cytosolic thioesterase 1), increased heart soleus muscle greater extent feeding high fat diet compared Western diet. conclusion, implicate inadequate induction cassette fatty acid-responsive genes, impaired activation fatty acid oxidation, development cardiac dysfunction Western diet.
