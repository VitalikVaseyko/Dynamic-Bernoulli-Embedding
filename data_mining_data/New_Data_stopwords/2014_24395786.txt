 Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) involved various physiological pathological processes insulin secretion, stem cell differentiation, cancer, aging. However, biochemical physiological function still debate. show UCP2 metabolite transporter regulates substrate oxidation mitochondria. shed light biochemical role, first studied effects silencing mitochondrial oxidation glucose glutamine. Compared wild-type, UCP2-silenced human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells, grown presence glucose, showed higher inner mitochondrial membrane potential ATP:ADP ratio associated lower lactate release. Opposite results obtained presence glutamine instead glucose. UCP2 reconstituted lipid vesicles catalyzed exchange malate, oxaloacetate, aspartate phosphate plus proton opposite sides membrane. higher levels citric acid cycle intermediates found mitochondria siUCP2-HepG2 cells compared found wild-type cells addition transport data indicate that, exporting C4 compounds mitochondria, UCP2 limits oxidation acetyl-CoA-producing substrates glucose enhances glutaminolysis, preventing mitochondrial accumulation C4 metabolites derived glutamine. work reveals unique regulatory mechanism cell bioenergetics provokes substantial reconsideration physiological pathological functions ascribed UCP2 based purported uncoupling properties.
