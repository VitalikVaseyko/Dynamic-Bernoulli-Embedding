 PURPOSE: characterize prevalence hypoxia leukemic bone marrow, association metabolic transcriptional changes leukemic blasts utility hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 leukemia models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy utilized interrogate pyruvate metabolism bone marrow murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model. Nanostring technology used evaluate gene set defining hypoxia signature leukemic blasts normal donors. efficacy hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 examined vitro vivo leukemia models. RESULTS: Metabolic imaging demonstrated increased glycolysis femur leukemic mice compared healthy control mice, suggesting metabolic reprogramming hypoxic bone marrow niches. Primary leukemic blasts samples AML patients overexpressed genes defining "hypoxia index" compared samples normal donors. TH-302 depleted hypoxic cells, prolonged survival xenograft leukemia models, reduced leukemia stem cell pool vivo aggressive FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 model, combination TH-302 tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib greater antileukemia effects either drug alone. Importantly, residual leukemic bone marrow cells syngeneic AML model remain hypoxic chemotherapy. turn, administration TH-302 following chemotherapy treatment mice residual disease prolonged survival, suggesting approach may suitable eliminating chemotherapy-resistant leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: findings implicate pathogenic role hypoxia leukemia maintenance chemoresistance demonstrate feasibility targeting hypoxic cells hypoxia cytotoxins.
