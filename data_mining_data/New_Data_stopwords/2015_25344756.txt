 heat-shock response complex cellular program induces major changes protein translation, folding degradation alleviate toxicity caused protein misfolding. Although heat shock widely used study proteostasis, remained unclear misfolded proteins targeted proteolysis conditions. found Rsp5 mammalian homologue Nedd4 important E3 ligases responsible increased ubiquitylation induced heat stress. determined Rsp5 ubiquitylates mainly cytosolic misfolded proteins upon heat shock proteasome degradation. found ubiquitylation heat-induced substrates requires Hsp40 co-chaperone Ydj1 associated Rsp5 upon heat shock. addition, ubiquitylation also promoted PY Rsp5-binding motifs found primarily structured regions stress-induced substrates, act heat-induced degrons. results support bipartite recognition mechanism combining direct chaperone-dependent ubiquitylation misfolded cytosolic proteins Rsp5.
