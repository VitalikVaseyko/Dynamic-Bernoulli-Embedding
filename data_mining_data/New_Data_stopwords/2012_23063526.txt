 Widespread changes gene expression drive tumorigenesis, yet knowledge aberrant epigenomic transcriptome profiles arise cancer cells poorly understood. Here, demonstrate metabolic transformation plays important role. Butyrate primary energy source normal colonocytes metabolized acetyl-CoA, shown important energetics also HAT activity. Due Warburg effect, cancerous colonocytes rely glucose primary energy source, butyrate accumulated functioned HDAC inhibitor. Although mechanisms increased histone acetylation, different target genes upregulated. Consequently, butyrate stimulated proliferation normal colonocytes cancerous colonocytes Warburg effect prevented occurring, whereas inhibited proliferation cancerous colonocytes undergoing Warburg effect. findings link common metabolite epigenetic mechanisms differentially utilized normal cancerous cells inherent metabolic differences.
