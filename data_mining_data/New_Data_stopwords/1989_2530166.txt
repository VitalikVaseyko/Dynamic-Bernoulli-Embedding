 Effect three antiandrogens: cyproterone acetate (5 mg/day, sc), flutamide (5 mg/day, sc) STS-557 (5 mg/day, po) estrogen, estradiol dipropionate (5 micrograms/day, sc) key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism investigated adult rat epididymis ventral prostate. Antiandrogens administered 21 days estrogen 14 days. caused significant decrease weight epididymis, seminal vesicles ventral prostate. significant decrease specific activities enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) occurred organs estrogen treated rats; activities enzymes lowered also prostate STS-557 treated rats. Flutamide cyproterone acetate ineffective regard. possible factors responsible ineffectiveness synthetic antiandrogens influencing epididymal metabolism discussed.
