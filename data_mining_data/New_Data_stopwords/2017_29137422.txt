 Aerobic glycolysis one important common characteristics cancer cells stem cells. Metabolism switch discovered important early event process reprogramming somatic cells induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). rate limiting kinase glycolysis, Pkm2 reported playing critical roles many tumors, yet role stem cells iPSCs induction poorly defined. present study, showed Pkm2 predominant pyruvate kinase embryonic stem cells (ESCs), expression increases many pluripotent genes. somatic cell reprogramming, up-regulation Pkm2 observed over-expression Pkm2 facilitate iPSCs induction, Pkm1 mutant form Pkm2 (Pkm2(K422R)) showed enhancement role iPSCs induction. Therefore, data demonstrated Pkm2 enhances pluripotency maintenance ESCs promotes pluripotency acquisition somatic cell reprogramming.
