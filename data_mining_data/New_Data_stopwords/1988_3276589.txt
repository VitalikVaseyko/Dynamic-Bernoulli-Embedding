 (i) Hepatocytes isolated adult rats cultured 2 3 weeks collagen modified, serum-free Waymouth medium containing fatty acids varying concentrations glucocorticoid, insulin glucagon. (ii) presence three hormones, possible maintain content DNA, activity glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase initial levels 2 3 weeks. activity glucokinase pyruvate kinase affected concentration insulin. (iii) activity alcohol dehydrogenase stable 3 days declined 25% initial level 2 weeks culture, irrespective presence hormones. (iv) Maintenance albumin secretion dependent presence glucocorticoid, glucocorticoid insulin showed additive or, time points, synergistic effect secretion. (v) content cytochrome P-450 could kept 65% initial level, provided relatively high concentration dexamethasone present (10(-6) M). (vi) absence hormones, urea synthesis 70% initial levels throughout experimental period. insulin glucocorticoid present, high concentration glucagon (10(-8) M) required maintain synthesis urea level. (vii) concluded hepatocyte cultures described present study may useful, well-defined system long-term metabolic, pharmacologic toxicologic studies.
