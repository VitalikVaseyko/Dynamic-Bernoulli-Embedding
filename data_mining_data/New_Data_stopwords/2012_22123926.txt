 cancer cells, aberrant conversion pyruvate lactate instead acetyl-CoA presence oxygen known Warburg effect. consequences mechanisms metabolic peculiarity incompletely understood. report p53 status key determinant Warburg effect. Wild-type p53 expression decreased levels pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-2 (Pdk2) product activity, inactive form pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (P-Pdc), key regulators pyruvate metabolism. Decreased levels Pdk2 P-Pdc turn promoted conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA instead lactate. Thus, wild-type p53 limited lactate production cancer cells unless Pdk2 could elevated. Together, results established wild-type p53 prevents manifestation Warburg effect controlling Pdk2. findings elucidate new mechanism p53 suppresses tumorigenesis acting level cancer cell metabolism.
