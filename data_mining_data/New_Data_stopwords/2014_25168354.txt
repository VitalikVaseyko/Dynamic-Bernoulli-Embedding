 Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) one major isoforms family glucose transporter proteins facilitates import glucose human cells fuel anaerobic metabolism. present study meant determine extent anaerobic/hypoxic state intratumoral microenvironment staining GLUT-1 intracranial non-embolized typical (WHO grade I; n = 40), brain invasive atypical (each grade II; n = 38) anaplastic meningiomas (WHO grade III, n = 6). addition, GLUT-1 staining levels compared various histological criteria used diagnosing grade II III meningiomas, namely, brain invasion, increased mitotic activity atypical cytoarchitectural change, defined presence least three hypercellularity, sheet-like growth, prominent nucleoli, small cell change "spontaneous" necrosis. level tumor hypoxia assessed converting extent intensity stainings multiplication immunoreactive score (IRS) statistically evaluated. results follows. (1) GLUT-1 expression found mainly weak grade meningiomas (IRS = 1-4) consistently strong grade III meningiomas (IRS = 6-12), grade II meningiomas GLUT-1 expression variable (IRS = 1-9). (2) Histologically typical, brain invasive meningiomas (WHO grade II) showed similarly low levels GLUT-1 expression observed grade meningiomas (IRS = 0-4). (3) GLUT-1 expression observed form patchy, multifocal staining reaction 76% stained grade I-III meningiomas, diffuse staining (in 11%) combined multifocal areas diffuse staining (in 13%) detected grades II III meningiomas, except uniform staining angiomatous grade meningioma. (4) "Spontaneous" necrosis small cell change typically occurred away intratumoral capillary network embedded within pattern GLUT-1 staining. Taken together, GLUT-1 staining cannot applied substitute histologic grading order predict tumor behavior. However, assessment tumor hypoxia association "spontaneous" necrosis foci small cell change may substantially contribute neuropathologic diagnosis grades II III meningioma.
