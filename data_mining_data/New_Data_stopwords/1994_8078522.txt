 Leishmania mexicana mexicana contains two tandemly arranged genes pyruvate kinase (PYK). 5' located gene codes polypeptide molecular mass 54,370. calculated net charge isoelectric point polypeptide -6 6.5, respectively. amino-acid sequence 73.7% identical Trypanosoma brucei PYK 46.4-49.8% enzyme mammalian cells. second gene appears functional, 5' 3' extremities undergone recombinations. L. m. mexicana PYK overexpressed Escherichia coli, using T7 expression system. Approximately 30% protein detected soluble cell fraction. highly purified chromatography DEAE-Sephacel Affigel Blue. 1-1 culture 6 mg enzyme obtained specific activity 224 units mg-1. protein subunit molecular mass 59,000, determined SDS/PAGE, isoelectric point 5.9. kinetic properties enzyme measured compared reported T. brucei enzyme. kinetics enzymes similar, important aspect activation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Nevertheless, differences observed; T. brucei enzyme activated effector cooperative manner, whereas activation L. m. mexicana enzyme cooperative.
