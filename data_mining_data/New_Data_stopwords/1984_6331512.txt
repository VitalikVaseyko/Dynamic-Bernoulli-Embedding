 Rat liver enzymes used study relationship vivo half-lives apparent hydrophobicity resistance inactivation mechanical shaking. apparent hydrophobicity enzymes, measured percent protein recovered octyl-Sepharose column, correlated known half-lives (r = 0.75, P less 0.01). presence specific ligands known increase compactness impeding unfolding proteins decreased apparent hydrophobicity fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. Resistance enzymes inactivation mechanical shaking correlated well vivo half-lives (r = 0.90, P less 0.01). shaking experiments done presence substrates, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase protected inactivation.
