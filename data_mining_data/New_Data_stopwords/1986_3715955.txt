 Dichloroacetate (DCA) known prevent phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) blocking action PDH kinase. action allows active PDHC exert effect metabolism glucose, lactate alanine acetyl CoA. DCA shown reduce serum lactate levels humans animals conditions diabetes, phenformin-induced hepatic failure, exercise, endotoxin-induced shock. Lactic acidosis brain often postulated cause neuronal damage following ischemia hypoxia. Therefore, examined effect intravenously administered DCA (100 mg/kg) rats rendered hyperglycemic intravenous glucose (2 g/kg), made undergo 15 minutes incomplete cerebral ischemia bilateral carotid ligation systemic hypotension (mean arterial pressure 50 mm Hg). DCA significantly reduced serum lactate levels pre-ischemia, effect serum lactate levels ischemia induction. Brain levels lactate, ATP PCr 15 minutes incomplete ischemia unaffected DCA. conclude in-vivo model control PDHC activity brain may different periphery, DCA effective reducing brain tissue lactate levels.
