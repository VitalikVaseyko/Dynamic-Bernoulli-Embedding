 short sequence amino acids including Lys-128 required normal nuclear accumulation wild-type deleted forms SV40 large antigen. cytoplasmic large mutant lacks sequences around Lys-128 localizes nucleus missing sequence attached amino terminus. implication sequence element around Lys-128 acts autonomous signal capable specifying nuclear location tested directly transferring amino termini beta-galactosidase pyruvate kinase, normally cytoplasmic protein. Sequences included putative signal induced fusion proteins accumulate completely nucleus discernible effect Lys-128 replaced Thr. reducing size transposed sequence conclude Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val act nuclear location signal. sequence may represent prototype similar sequences nuclear proteins.
