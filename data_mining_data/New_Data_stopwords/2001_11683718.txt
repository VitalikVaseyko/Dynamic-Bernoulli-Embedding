 isolated 14 differentially displayed 10 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) Musculus biceps femoris newborn healthy splay leg piglets. comparison EMBL/GenBank data could identify nine porcine homologues human genes (TATA box binding protein associated factor B TAF1B; B-cell CLL/lymphoma 7B BCL7B; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4 PDK4; ribosomal protein S10 RPS10; SPARC-like 1 SPARCL1; epithelial protein lost neoplasm beta EPLIN; N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 NDRG2; pleiomorphic adenoma gene like 2 PLAGL and, BCL-2 associated transcription factor short form BTFS). Eight fragments correspond uncharacterized ESTs 7 ESTs significant match database sequences. data provide first expression profiles skeletal muscle neonatal piglets basis candidate gene investigations congenital splay leg piglets.
