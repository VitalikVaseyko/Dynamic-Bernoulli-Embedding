 4-Substituted styrylglyoxals synthesized found benefit borate catalysis serve highly reactive arginine modifiers. study mechanism arginine modification affirmed: (i) role electronic effects modulating arginine reactivity alpha-dicarbonyls, (ii) intermediacy reaction reversible arginine-alpha-dicarbonyl complex (iii) identity nucleophilic attack ketone rate determining step arginine reaction arylglyoxals. 4-Methoxystyrylglyoxal 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenylglyoxal used probes analyzing representative enzymes reactivities susceptible arginyls. susceptible arginyls lactate malate dehydrogenases thus found appreciably reactive carboxypeptidase-A pyruvate kinase moderately reactive.
