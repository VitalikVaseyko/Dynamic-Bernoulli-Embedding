 Blocking interaction immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 ligand PD-L1 associated good clinical outcomes broad variety malignancies. High levels PD-L1 promote tumor growth restraining CD8(+) T-cell responses tumors. Limiting PD-L1 expression function therefore critical allowing development antitumor immune responses effective tumor clearance. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) also key player regulating cancer well immune responses. PKM2 catalyzes final rate-limiting step glycolysis. Furthermore, PKM2 dimer translocates nucleus, stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (Hif-1alpha) transactivation domain function recruitment p300 hypoxia response elements (HRE) Hif-1alpha target genes. Here, provide first evidence role PKM2 regulating expression PD-L1 macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), cells, tumor cells. LPS-induced expression PD-L1 primary macrophages inhibited PKM2 targeting compound TEPP-46. Furthermore, RNA silencing PKM2 inhibited LPS-induced PD-L1 expression. regulation occurs direct binding PKM2 Hif-1alpha HRE sites PD-L1 promoter. Moreover, TEPP-46 inhibited expression PD-L1 macrophages, DCs, cells well tumor cells mouse CT26 cancer model. findings broaden understanding PKM2 may contribute tumor progression may explain upregulation PD-L1 tumor microenvironment.
