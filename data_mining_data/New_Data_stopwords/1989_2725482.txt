 effects high carbohydrate diet renal gluconeogenic glycolytic capacities activities main enzymes carbohydrate metabolism, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase studied. parameters analysed two separate isolated fractions renal tubule, proximal convoluted (PCT) distal convoluted (DCT) zones. results presented study show rapid adaptation capacity kidney response high amount dietary carbohydrate, characterized decrease glucose production fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity proximal tubules, increase glycolytic flux phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase activities distal tubules. changes enzyme activities took place subsaturating substrate concentrations maximum velocity suggest probably due allosteric and/or covalent modifications so, independent variations cellular levels enzymes.
