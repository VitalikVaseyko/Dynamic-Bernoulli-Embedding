 Cancers "reprogrammed" use much higher rate glycolysis (GLY) relative oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), even presence adequate amounts oxygenation. Originally identified Nobel Laureate Otto Warburg, hallmark cancer recently termed metabolic reprogramming represents way cancer tissue divert carbon skeletons produce biomass. Understanding mechanisms underlie metabolic shift lead better strategies cancer treatments. Malignant gliomas, cancers resistant conventional treatments, highly glycolytic seem particularly suited approaches subvert phenotype.
