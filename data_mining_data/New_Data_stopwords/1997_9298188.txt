 pathway conversion metabolic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) formation acetate, succinate, formate, H2 anaerobic cellulolytic bacterium Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1 constructed basis enzyme activities detected extracts cells grown cellulose- cellobiose-limited continuous culture. PEP converted acetate CO2 (via pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase) carboxylated form succinate (via PEP carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase). Lactate formed even rapid growth (batch culture, mu = 0.35/h). H2 formed hydrogenase rather cleavage formate, 13C-NMR 14C-exchange reaction data indicated formate produced CO2 reduction, cleavage pyruvate. distribution PEP acetate succinate pathways affected changing extracellular pH growth rates within normal growth range. However, increasing growth rate 0.017/h 0.244/h resulted shift toward formate production, presumably expense H2. shift suggested reducing equivalents could balanced formate H2 production without affecting yields major carbon-containing fermentation endproducts.
