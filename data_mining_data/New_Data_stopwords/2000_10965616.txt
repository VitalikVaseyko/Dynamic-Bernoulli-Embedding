 OBJECTIVE: Activated leukocytes products play significant role reperfusion injury cause microvascular occlusion--the 'no-reflow phenomenon'--which decreases coronary blood flow release aortic cross-clamp open-heart surgery. study designed evaluate efficacy leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia patients right ventricular pressure volume overloaded congenital heart disease undergoing intracardiac repair. SUBJECTS METHODS: Fourteen infants children undergoing intracardiac repair congenital heart defects subjects study. Leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia employed seven patients (Group I). control, terminal blood cardioplegia leukocytes employed seven patients (Group II). order evaluate myocardial anaerobic metabolism, arteriovenous difference pyruvate lactate levels compared groups. Blood samples taken simultaneously arterial limb bypass circuit coronary sinus immediately after, 5, 10, 20 minutes after, release aortic cross-clamp. RESULTS: coronary arteriovenous difference pyruvate lactate levels demonstrated myocardial anaerobic metabolism Group II significantly higher Group I. delta excess lactate demonstrated myocardial hypoxia Group II persisted significantly longer Group I. tendency creatine kinase-MB level 6 hr surgery lower Group Group II. CONCLUSION: Leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia may reduce myocardial anaerobic metabolism patients right ventricular pressure volume overloaded congenital heart disease undergoing intracardiac repair.
