 kinetic properties sea urchin flagellar dynein ATPase reinvestigated using continuous assay regenerates ATP contains P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate, potent adenylate kinase inhibitor. Earlier studies (Shimizu, T. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 4347-4354) revealed complex, highly cooperative kinetics respect MgATP2- concentration absence inhibitor. Ap5A, kinetics characteristic classical Michaelis-Menten enzymes. Isolated 21 14S enzyme forms also examined, kinetic parameters presented Vanadate inhibition patterns presence P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate lose nonlinear character, observe linear noncompetitive inhibition "mixed" type.
