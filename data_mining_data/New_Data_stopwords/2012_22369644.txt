 AIMS: investigated molecular mechanism ethyl pyruvate (EP) induces heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) RAW 264.7 cells effect survival rate cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced wild-type (WT) HO-1 knockout (HO-1(-/-)) septic mice. RESULTS: EP induced HO-1 dose- time-dependent manner, mediated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling cascade RAW 264.7 cells. EP significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release RAW 264.7 cells. inhibitory effect EP LPS-stimulated iNOS expression HMGB1 release reversed transfection siHO-1RNA RAW 264.7 cells, EP failed reduce HO-1(-/-) peritoneal macrophages treated LPS. Moreover, treatment cells glutathione ethyl ester (GSH-Et), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), siHO-1, p38-siRNA transfection inhibited anti-inflammatory effect EP. Interestingly, HO-1 induction phosphorylation p38 EP reversed GSH-Et, antioxidant redox element-luciferase activity EP reversed SB203580 LPS-activated cells. EP increased survival decreased serum HMGB1 CLP-WT mice, whereas increase survival decrease circulating HMGB1 HO-1(-/-) CLP-mice. INNOVATION CONCLUSION: work provides new insights understanding molecular mechanism showing EP induces HO-1 p38 MAPK- NRF2-dependent pathway decreasing GSH cellular levels. conclude EP inhibits proinflammatory response LPS macrophages increases survival CLP-induced septic mice upregulation HO-1 level, p38 MAPK Nrf2 play important role.
