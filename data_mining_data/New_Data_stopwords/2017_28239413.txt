 BACKGROUND: Acetyl-CoA important precursor Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Various approaches adopted improve cytosolic level previously emphasis engineering "acetyl-" part acetyl-CoA. best knowledge, reports engineering "-CoA" part far. RESULTS: study, tried engineer S. cerevisiae "-CoA" part via pantothenate kinase overexpression (PanK S. cerevisiae, rate-limiting enzyme CoA synthesis) "acetyl-"part PDH bypass introduction (ALD6 S. cerevisiae SeAcs(L641P) Salmonella enteric). naringenin-producing reporter strain constructed reflect cytosolic acetyl-CoA level acetyl-CoA precursor naringenin. found PanK overexpression PDH bypass introduction alone led twofold 6.74-fold increase naringenin titer, combination (strain CENFPAA01) resulted 24.4-fold increase compared control (strain CENF09) presence 0.5 mM substrate p-coumaric acid. supplement PanK substrate pantothenate resulted another 19% increase naringenin production. CONCLUSIONS: greatly enhance acetyl-CoA level yeast cytosol, feasible engineer "acetyl-" part "-CoA" part simultaneously. Insufficient CoA supply might aggravate acetyl-CoA shortage cause low yield target product.
