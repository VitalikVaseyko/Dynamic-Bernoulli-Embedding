 critical minimum values Na,K-ATPase glycolytic enzyme activities erythrocyte viability lost calculated using mathematical model erythrocyte, included reactions glycolysis, adenylate metabolism, ionic balance, osmotic regulation erythrocyte volume. criterion cell death increase volume level sequestrated circulation lysed. hemolytic anemia associated hexokinase pyruvate kinase deficiency, activities enzymes measured patient erythrocytes appeared close calculated critical values. contrast, hemolytic anemia associated phosphofructokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, activities enzymes measured patient erythrocytes significantly greater calculated critical values. case, deficient enzyme stable, i.e. activity cell low, constant time, deficiency observed would account erythrocyte destruction observed development hemolytic anemia. shown, however, phosphofructokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, hemolytic anemia arise instability enzymes time.
