 Ligation cell surface GRP78 activated alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M*) promotes cell proliferation suppresses apoptosis. alpha2M*-treated human prostate cancer cells exhibit 2-3-fold increase glucose uptake lactate secretion, effect similar insulin treatment. alpha2M* insulin-treated cells, mRNA levels SREBP1-c, SREBP2, fatty-acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, Glut-1 significantly increased together protein levels, except SREBP2. Pretreatment cells alpha2M* antagonist antibody directed carboxyl-terminal domain GRP78 blocks alpha2M*-mediated effects, silencing GRP78 expression RNAi inhibits up-regulation ATP citrate lyase fatty-acid synthase. alpha2M* induces 2-3-fold increase lipogenesis determined 6-[(14)C]glucose 1-[(14)C]acetate incorporation free cholesterol, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine, blocked inhibitors fatty-acid synthase, PI 3-kinase, mTORC, antibody carboxyl-terminal domain GRP78. also assessed incorporation [(14)CH3]choline phosphatidylcholine observed similar effects. Lipogenesis significantly affected pretreatment prostate cancer cells fatostatin A, blocks sterol regulatory element-binding protein proteolytic cleavage activation. study demonstrates alpha2M* functions growth factor, leading proliferation prostate cancer cells promoting insulin-like responses. antibody carboxyl-terminal domain GRP78 may important applications prostate cancer therapy.
