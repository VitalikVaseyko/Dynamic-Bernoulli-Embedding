 controversy whether upstream stimulatory factors (USF) regulate glucose responsiveness L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) promoter activity hepatocytes. suggested USF-2 required glucose stimulation L-PK promoter activity single islet beta-cells INS-1 cells (Kennedy, H. J., Viollet, B., Rafiq, I., Kahn, A., Rutter, G. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20636-20640). present study, tet-on system employed achieve tightly controlled inducible expression USF-1 -2 dominant-negative mutants DN-USF-1 (DeltabTDU1) -2 (TDU2) INS-1 cells. Quantitative Northern blot analysis shows neither basal level glucose responsiveness endogenous L-PK mRNA affected overexpression USF-1 -2. Likewise, L-PK expression unaltered dominant-negative suppression USF function. Western blotting demonstrates USF-1 -2 DN-USF-1 -2 proteins stably expressed nuclear fractions INS-1 cells. Immunofluorescence staining indicates uniform induction transgene-encoded proteins cell nuclei. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using L-PK promoter segment reveal induction USF-1 -2 dramatically enhances USF binding activity, whereas DN-USF-1 -2 abolish binding. DN-USF-1 -2 exert dominant-negative effect forming non-functional heterodimers endogenous USF proteins. Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) recently shown regulate glucose responsiveness L-PK promoter activity hepatocytes. report presence transcription factor rat islets INS-1 cells. Glucose stimulates ChREBP transcription INS-1 cells, shown nuclear run-on experiments. Overexpression ChREBP INS-1 cells using tet-on system results left shift glucose responsiveness L-PK expression enhanced L-PK promoter activity. endogenous doxycycline-induced ChREBP proteins bind L-PK promoter glucose-dependent manner. unprecedented results suggest ChREBP rather USF mediates glucose-promoted L-PK expression insulin-secreting cells.
