 effects benfluorex two metabolites (S 422-1 1475-1) fatty acid glucose metabolic fluxes specific gene expression studied hepatocytes isolated 24-h fasted rats. benfluorex 422-1 (0.1 1 mmol/l) reduced beta-oxidation rates ketogenesis, whereas 1475-1 effect. concentration, benfluorex 422-1 efficient reducing gluconeogenesis lactate/pyruvate 1475-1. Benfluorex inhibited gluconeogenesis level pyruvate carboxylase (45% fall acetyl-CoA concentration) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (decrease ATP/ADP NAD(+)/NADH ratios). Accordingly, neither benfluorex 422-1 inhibited gluconeogenesis dihydroxyacetone, stimulated gluconeogenesis glycerol. hepatocytes cultured presence benfluorex 422-1 (10 100 micromol/l), expression genes encoding enzymes fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase [CPT] I), ketogenesis (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase), gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase, PEPCK) decreased, whereas mRNAs encoding glucokinase pyruvate kinase increased. contrast, Glut-2, acyl-CoA synthetase, CPT II gene expression affected benfluorex 422-1. conclusion, work suggests benfluorex mainly via 422-1 reduces gluconeogenesis affecting gene expression metabolic status hepatocytes.
