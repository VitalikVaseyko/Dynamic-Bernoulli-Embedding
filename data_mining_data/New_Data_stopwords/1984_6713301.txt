 Pyruvate kinase filamentous, citric acid producing fungus Aspergillus niger purified 100-fold ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, gel filtration. addition fructose-1,6-diphosphate necessary prevent loss activity purification. enzyme purified presence fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) exhibits hyperbolic kinetics respect phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP. Monovalent cations activated enzyme (K+, NH4+). FDP neither activated inhibited enzymatic activity extracts freshly prepared absence exogenous FDP; ATP showed weak activation. contrast enzyme crude extracts stored presence glycerol 3 days showed activation FDP metabolite thereof inhibition ATP. absence FDP sigmoidal kinetics obtained respect PEP, became hyperbolic kinetics addition FDP. ATP inhibition turned slight ATP activation presence FDP. However, possible reactivate inactivated pyruvate kinase (after dialysis absence FDP) adding FDP enzyme assay. results high affinity pyruvate kinase FDP (Ka less 0.1 microM), concluded enzyme probably FDP bound protein vivo. significance hypothesis regulation glycolysis A. niger, special reference mechanism citric acid accumulation, discussed.
