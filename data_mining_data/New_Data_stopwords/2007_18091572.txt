 Ca++ antagonists tested improve I/R injury kidney, clinical use limited due hypotensive properties. Therefore, tested hypothesis whether infusing Ca++ blocker nimodipine directly renal artery would reduce kidney cell apoptosis thus improve organ function porcine model suprarenal abdominal aortic cross-clamping. prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded study, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, instrumented pigs underwent 45 min suprarenal aortic cross-clamping animals receiving either 0.25 microg kg(-1) min(-1) nimodipine (n = 8) vehicle (n = 8). Systemic right kidney hemodynamics, oxygen exchange, metabolism assessed clamping, well 75 195 min reperfusion (i.e., 120 240 min aortic occlusion). end experiments, right kidney harvested conventional hematoxylineosin staining immunohistochemistry cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene expression apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin end labeling test). Neither systemic renal hemodynamics oxygen exchange, plasma urine protein concentrations, urine osmolarity, lactate-pyruvate ratios showed intergroup difference. Nimodipine infusion resulted significantly higher creatinine clearance 195 min reperfusion (26 [17 - 42] vs. 17 [9 - 22] mL x min(-1)) attenuated renal tubular damage, indicated lower urinary small protein (25 kd) concentrations. Improved renal function concomitant significantly less pronounced positive nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin end labeling staining. porcine model suprarenal aortic cross-clamping, intrarenal nimodipine infusion improved postischemia kidney function, likely result attenuated glomerular apoptosis.
