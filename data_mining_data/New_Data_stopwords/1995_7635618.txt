 application metabolic control theory carbohydrate breakdown tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta shows necessary phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase modulated order control relative fluxes two arms phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint. Changes activity enzymes outside two branches also influence flux ratio. Control coefficients individual enzymes fluxes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase fixed, vary flux ratio two arms branchpoint changes. metabolic model also used evaluate role fructose-1,6-bisphosphate loop calculate metabolite transition time control coefficients.
