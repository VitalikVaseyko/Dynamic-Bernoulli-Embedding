 Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) type L partly purified rat kidney. last two purification steps, incorporation [32P]phosphate protein incubation [32P]ATP cyclic 3',5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase found parallel pyruvate kinase activity. phosphorylation enzyme, major radioactive band molecular weight 57 000 found polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [32P]Phosphorylserine isolated kidney pyruvate kinase. Immunological identity found liver kidney pyruvate kinases type L. autoradiography high-voltage electropherograms partial acid hydrolysis phosphorylated rat liver kidney pyruvate kinases type L, identical results obtained. affinity phosphoenolpyruvate found decreased phosphorylation enzyme change apparent Km 0.15 mM 0.35 mM. incubation phosphorylated kidney pyruvate kinase phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve found identical unphosphorylated enzyme. Thus, activity rat kidney pyruvate kinase type L probability regulated reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction, thereby indicating hormonal regulation gluconeogenesis via cyclic AMP may importance renal cortex.
