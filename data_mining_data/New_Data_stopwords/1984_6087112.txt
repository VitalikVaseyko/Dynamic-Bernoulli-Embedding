 Key enzyme activities carbohydrate metabolism evaluated sensitive indicators liver cell injury rats. Hexokinase glucose 6-phosphatase distribution acinus liver also studied histochemically following results: activities liver-specific enzymes, glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1.6-diphosphatase, glucokinase pyruvate kinase Type L, decreased. activities nonspecific enzymes liver, hexokinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase Type M2 increased. decrease glucokinase activity marked found early one day bile duct ligation. Isozymes HK, I, II III, increased extents. Increased hexokinase activity found centrolobular area, decreased activity glucose 6-phosphatase observed. changes key enzyme activities indicated presence hepatocyte injury caused bile duct ligation.
