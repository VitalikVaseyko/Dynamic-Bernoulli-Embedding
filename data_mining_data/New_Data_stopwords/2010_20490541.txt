 Metabolite profiles activities key enzymes metabolism organic acids, nitrogen amino acids compared chlorotic leaves normal leaves 'Honeycrisp' apple understand accumulation non-structural carbohydrates affects metabolism organic acids, nitrogen amino acids. Excessive accumulation non-structural carbohydrates much lower CO(2) assimilation found chlorotic leaves normal leaves, confirming feedback inhibition photosynthesis chlorotic leaves. Dark respiration activities several key enzymes glycolysis tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, ATP-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, aconitase isocitrate dehydrogenase significantly higher chlorotic leaves normal leaves. However, concentrations organic acids including phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate, oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate, malate fumarate, activities key enzymes involved anapleurotic pathway including PEP carboxylase, NAD-malate dehydrogenase NAD-malic enzyme significantly lower chlorotic leaves normal leaves. Concentrations soluble proteins free amino acids significantly lower chlorotic leaves normal leaves. Activities key enzymes nitrogen assimilation amino acid synthesis, including nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, ferredoxin NADH-dependent glutamate synthase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase significantly lower chlorotic leaves normal leaves. concluded that, response excessive accumulation non-structural carbohydrates, glycolysis TCA cycle up-regulated "consume" excess carbon available, whereas anapleurotic pathway, nitrogen assimilation amino acid synthesis down-regulated reduce overall rate amino acid protein synthesis.
