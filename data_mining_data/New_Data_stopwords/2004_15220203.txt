 Glucocorticoids impair insulin sensitivity. insulin resistance closely linked increased incidence cardiovascular diseases given metabolic abnormalities linked initiation heart failure, examined acute effects dexamethasone (DEX) rat cardiac metabolism. Although injection DEX 4 h associated hyperinsulinemia, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp showed decrease glucose infusion rate. Rates cardiac glycolysis unaffected, whereas rate glucose oxidation following DEX significantly decreased could associated augmented expression PDK4 mRNA protein. Myocardial glycogen content DEX hearts increased compared control. Similar hypoinsulinemia induced streptozotocin (STZ), hearts insulin-resistant DEX animals also demonstrated enlargement coronary lipoprotein lipase (LPL) pool. However, unlike STZ, DEX hearts showed greater basal release LPL able maintain high heparin-releasable LPL vitro. effect could explained enhanced LPL mRNA expression following DEX. data provide evidence setting insulin resistance, increase LPL could facilitate increased delivery fatty acid heart, leading excessive triglyceride storage. determined whether acute effects DEX cardiac metabolism translated increased cardiovascular risk.
