 Two patients non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia found elevated red blood cell pyruvate kinase activities commensurate decreased mean red cell age, residual pyruvate kinase marked kinetic abnormalities. Accumulation metabolic intermediates pyruvate kinase reduced levels activity red blood cells parents patients supported diagnosis inherited abnormal pyruvate kinase causing hemolytic anemia. Although observed two unrelated persons, review enzyme assays performed red blood cells 651 patients hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia suggests occurrence rare.
