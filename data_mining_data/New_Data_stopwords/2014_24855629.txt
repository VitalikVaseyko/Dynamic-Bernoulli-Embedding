 BACKGROUND: AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates key metabolic reactions plays major role glucose homeostasis. Activating AMPK considered one potential therapeutic strategies treating type-2 diabetes. However, targeting AMPK small molecule mediated approach challenging owing diverse isoforms enzyme varied combination different tissues. current study employ novel strategy achieving AMPK activation increasing levels cellular AMP (an allosteric activator AMPK) levels activating enzyme involved AMP biosynthesis namely Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL). METHODS: Rat primary hepatocytes cultured metabolic overload conditions (500 muM palmitate) induce insulin resistance. ADSL overexpressed hepatocytes effect hepatic glucose output, triglyceride accumulation checked. addition this, ADSL overexpressed high fat diet induced obese mice hydrodynamic tail vein injection effect fasting glucose, glucose tolerance pyruvate tolerance checked. RESULTS: Rat primary hepatocytes cultured metabolic overload conditions developed insulin resistance measured terms failure insulin suppress glucose output. Overexpressing ADSL hepatocytes resulted increased AMPK phosporylation improved insulin sensitivity also resulted reduced triglyceride accumulation inflammatory cytokine levels. addition this, ADSL overexpressed high fat diet induced obese mice, resulted reduced fasting hyperglycemia (20% reduction), increased glucose pyruvate tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: study indicates activating ADSL potential mechanism achieve activation AMPK cells. leads novel idea exploring purine nucleotide metabolic pathway promising therapeutic target diabetes metabolic syndrome.
