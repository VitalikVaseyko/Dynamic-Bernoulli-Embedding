 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVE: Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) rare, inherited disease causing chronic hemolysis anemia varying intensity. genetic heterogeneity PKD high and, day, 240 different mutations identified. PATIENTS METHODS: 15 unrelated patients affected PKD studied. PKLR gene sequencing performed SANGER, including determination promoter regions, exonic, intronic flanking 3'UTR. RESULTS: Patients classified 3 groups based intensity clinical symptoms: I) severe severe (8 patients); II) moderate (2 patients), III) mild (5 patients). Six 18 alleles found new mutations described previously, PKLR c.721G>T mutation prevalent (26.67%), followed PKLR c.1456C>T mutation (13.33%). CONCLUSIONS: Spain, genetic heterogeneity PKLR still high differs observed previous study carried 1998. Total PKLR gene sequencing necessary characterization patients PKD genetic counseling.
