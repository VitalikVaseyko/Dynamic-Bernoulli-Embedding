 Iron overload serious condition, may lead irreversible organ damage. risk iron accumulation pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) traditionally regarded low, recent evidence questioned notion. present case young PKD patient showing evidence asymptomatic iron accumulation measured liver iron concentration (LIC) obtained noninvasively magnetic resonance imaging. iron overload related blood transfusions, rather secondary concomitant risk factors leading increased intestinal iron absorption, chronic hemolysis splenectomy. iron status PKD patients, preferably assessed LIC measurements, therefore evaluated regularly also asymptomatic patients. evaluation start already young age, order initiate iron chelation development iron-induced organ damage.
