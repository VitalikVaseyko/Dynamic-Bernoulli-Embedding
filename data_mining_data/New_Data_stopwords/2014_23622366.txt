 Inborn errors metabolism may impact muscle peripheral nerve. Abnormalities involve mitochondria subcellular organelles peroxisomes lysosomes related turnover recycling cellular compartments. Treatable causes beta-oxidation defects producing progressive neuropathy; pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, porphyria, vitamin B12 deficiency causing recurrent episodes neuropathy acute motor deficit mimicking Guillain-Barre syndrome. hand, lysosomal (mucopolysaccharidosis, Gaucher Fabry diseases), mitochondriopathic (mitochondrial nuclear mutations mDNA depletion), peroxisomal (adrenomyeloneuropathy, Refsum disease, sterol carrier protein-2 deficiency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, alpha-methylacyl racemase deficiency) diseases multisystemic disorders involving also heart, liver, brain, retina, kidney. Pathophysiology metabolic myopathies related impairment energy production abnormal production reactive oxygen species (ROS). Main symptoms exercise intolerance myalgias, cramps recurrent myoglobinuria limb weakness associated elevation serum creatine kinase. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency, followed acid maltase deficiency, lipin deficiency, common cause isolated rhabdomyolysis. Metabolic myopathies frequently associated extra-neuromuscular disorders particularly involving heart, liver, brain, retina, skin, kidney.
