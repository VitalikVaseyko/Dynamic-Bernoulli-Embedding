 Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) found predominately terminally differentiated cells, adipocytes, endothelia smooth muscle cells, well type pneumocytes. main structural component caveolae, Cav-1 important modulating cellular signaling. present study, expression clinical role Cav-1 analyzed tumor stromal human cancer cells, respectively. results previous studies shown downregulation tumor stromal Cav-1 promotes tumor survival predicts poor tumor prognosis, predominantly concentrating mechanism metabolism cancer microenvironment (according autophagic tumor stroma model cancer metabolism reverse Warburg effect). However, contradictory results concerning expression, clinical roles associated mechanisms Cav-1 reported. improved understanding Cav-1 expression tumor stromal cancer cells increase knowledge regard clinical value Cav-1 detailed mechanisms. review summarizes novel data concerning clinical values probable mechanisms Cav-1 expression tumor stromal (predominantly cancer-associated fibroblasts) cancer cells, respectively.
