 Ischemia-reperfusion injury heart results enhanced production H2O2 activation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Since mutations AMPK result cardiovascular dysfunction, investigated whether activation AMPK mediates H2O2-induced reduction cardiac mechanical function. Isolated working rat hearts perfused 37 degrees C Krebs-Henseleit solution. Following 20-minute equilibration period, single bolus H2O2 (300 micromol/L) added hearts perfused additional 5 min. H2O2 induced dramatic progressive reduction cardiac function. accompanied rapid significant activation AMPK, increase Thr-172 phosphorylation AMPK, increase creatine phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr) ratio. Addition pyruvate (5 mmol/L) perfusate prevented H2O2-mediated reduction cardiac mechanical dysfunction, activation myocardial AMPK activity, increase AMPK phosphorylation increase Cr/PCr ratio. Hearts challenged H2O2 (300 micromol/L) presence either AMPK inhibitor Compound C (10 micromol/L) vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1%) showed reduced impairment cardiac mechanical function. Compound C vehicle significantly inhibited myocardial AMPK activity. Thus, H2O2 induces cardiac dysfunction via AMPK-dependent independent mechanisms.
