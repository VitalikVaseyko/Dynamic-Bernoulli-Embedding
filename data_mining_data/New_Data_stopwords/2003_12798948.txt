 cDNA clone encoding pyruvate kinase (PK) isolated skeletal muscle cDNA library globefish (Fugu rubripes), kind lower vertebrate. full-length cDNA globefish skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase (FM-PK) approximately 2 kb encodes protein comprising 530 amino acids. FM-PK gene spanning approximately 4.8 kb consists 11 exons. FM-PK mRNA detected muscle heart using Northern blots. recombinant FM-PK (rFM-PK) expressed baculovirus-insect cell system purified using ion-exchange chromatography. purified rFM-PK shown exist 230 kDa homotetramer composed 57 kDa subunits. Gel filtration showed 230000 tetramer subunit. apparent K(m) (or S(0.5)) Hill coefficient phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) ADP 0.14 mM, 1.3 0.30 mM 0.98 pH 7.4, respectively, enzyme saturated second substrate. rFM-PK strongly activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, apparent K(m) PEP changes 0.059 mM Hill coefficient 1.1. ATP, product enzyme reaction, inhibits activity. first report show full-length cDNA amino acid sequence PK species fish.
