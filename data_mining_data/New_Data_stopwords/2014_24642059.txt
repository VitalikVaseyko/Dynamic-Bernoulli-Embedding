 Pentachlorophenol (PCP) prevalent pollutant environment demonstrated serious toxicant humans animals. However, little known regarding molecular mechanism underlying toxic effects vertebrate early development. explore impacts underlying mechanisms PCP early development, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos exposed PCP concentrations 0, 20 50 mug/L, microscopic observation cDNA microarray analysis subsequently conducted gastrulation stage. morphological observations revealed PCP caused developmental delay zebrafish embryos concentration-dependent manner. Transcriptomic data showed 50 mug/L PCP treatment resulted significant changes gene expression level, genes involved energy metabolism cell behavior identified based gene functional enrichment analysis. energy production embryos influenced PCP via activation glycolysis along inhibition oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). results suggested PCP acts inhibitor OXPHOS 8 hpf (hours postfertilization). Consistent activated glycolysis, cell cycle activity PCP-treated embryos higher controls. characteristics similar Warburg effect, occurs human tumors. microinjection exogenous ATP confirmed additional energy supply could rescue PCP-treated embryos developmental delay due energy deficit. Taken together, results demonstrated PCP causes Warburg-like effect zebrafish embryos gastrulation, affected embryos phenotype developmental delay.
