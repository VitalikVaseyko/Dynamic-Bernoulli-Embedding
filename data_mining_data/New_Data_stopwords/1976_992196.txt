 study glucose uptake lactate release performed isolated diaphragm stimulated regularly electric device. stimulated model much sensitive motionless diaphragm preparation Warburg apparatus. diaphragms take twice much glucose release one half times lactate summer winter. increase relates lighting conditions. suppressed even summer, rats maintained darkness 15 days experiment, factors remaining unchanged. Several antidiabetic drugs (insulin, metformin, phenformin, buformin), active stimulated diaphragm, effects reduced suppressed animals exposed intense light; regain effect even summer, animals kept dark. mechanism practical implication findings discussed.
