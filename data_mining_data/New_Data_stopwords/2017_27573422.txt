 Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) potent stimulator epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), key event initiation tumor cell metastasis. Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1) known involved resolution inflammation; however, whether AT-RvD1 exerts effects TGF-beta1-induced EMT remains unclear. Thus, first explored effects AT-RvD1 EMT lung cancer cells. Treatment TGF-beta1 increased level reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduced expression nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). expression E-cadherin A549 lung cancer cells reduced, expression vimentin enhanced. AT-RvD1 enhanced expression E-cadherin concentrationdependent manner suppressed expression Nrf2 vimentin. AT-RvD1 affect proliferation A549 lung cancer cells whereas suppressed TGF-beta1induced migration invasion A549 cells. expression pyruvate kinase M2 (Pkm2), associated TGF-beta-induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2), significantly increased TGF-beta1-induced EMT A549 lung cancer cells. mTOR pathway known regulate expression various glycolytic enzymes including Pkm2. examined involvement mTOR pathway suppressive effects AT-RvD1 Pkm2 expression A549 cells. mTOR activator restored expression Pkm2 partially downregulated expression E-cadherin. However, mTOR activator clear effect TGF-beta1-induced EMT. results suggest AT-RvD1 closely linked oxidative stress partially inhibits TGF-beta1-induced EMT inhibition mTOR pathway reducing expression Pkm2.
