 Akt kinase key regulator cell proliferation survival. activated part PDK1-induced phosphorylation. show RalGDS, Ras effector protein activates Ral GTPases, second function promotes Akt phosphorylation PDK1 bringing two kinases together. support conclusion finding suppression RalGDS expression cells inhibits epidermal growth factor insulin-induced phosphorylation Akt. Moreover, PDK1 complexes N-GDS, Akt complexes central region RalGDS intermediary, JIP1. biological significance newly discovered RalGDS function highlighted observation N-terminally deleted mutant RalGDS retains ability activate Ral proteins loses ability activate Akt also fails promote cell proliferation. Thus, RalGDS forms nexus transduces growth factor signaling Ral GTPase Akt-mediated signaling cascades.
