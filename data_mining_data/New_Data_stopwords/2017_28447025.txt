 tumor microenvironment (TME) ensemble non-tumor cells comprising fibroblasts, cells immune system, endothelial cells, besides various soluble secretory factors cellular components (including tumor cells). TME forms pro-tumorigenic cocoon around tumor cells reprogramming metabolism occurs tumor non-tumor cells underlies nature interactions well competitions ensuring steady supply nutrients anapleoretic molecules tumor cells fuels growth even hypoxic conditions. metabolic reprogramming also plays significant role suppressing immune attack tumor cells resistance therapies. Thus, metabolic cooperation competition among different TME components besides inherent alterations tumor cells arising genetic well epigenetic changes supports growth, metastasis, therapeutic resistance. review focuses metabolic remodeling achieved active cooperation competition among three principal components TME-the tumor cells, cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts discussing current strategies target metabolism TME components. Further, also consider probable therapeutic opportunities targeting various metabolic pathways well signaling molecules/transcription factors regulating development novel treatment strategies cancer.
