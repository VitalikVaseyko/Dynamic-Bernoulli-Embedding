 Cystinosis systemic genetic disease caused lysosomal transport deficiency accumulating cystine lysosomes tissues. Although tissue damage might depend cystine accumulation, mechanisms tissue damage still obscures. Considering thiol-containing enzymes critical several metabolic pathways, main objective investigate effects cystine cystine dimethylester load thiol-containing enzymes creatine kinase pyruvate kinase, brain cortex young Wistar rats. animals injected twice day 1.6 micromol/g body weight cystine dimethylester 1 micromol/g body weight cystine and/or 0.46 micromol/g body weight cysteamine 16th 20th postpartum day sacrificed 12 h. Cystine cystine dimethylester administration inhibited two enzyme activities. Co-administration cysteamine, drug used treat cystinotic patients, normalized two enzyme activities. Lactate dehydrogenase activity, nonthiol-containing enzyme affected cystine dimethylester administration. Cystine inhibits creatine kinase pyruvate activities possibly oxidation sulfhydryl groups enzymes. Considering creatine kinase pyruvate kinase, like thiol-containing enzymes, crucial energy homeostasis antioxidant defenses, enzymes inhibition caused cystine released lysosomes could one mechanisms tissue damage patients cystinosis.
