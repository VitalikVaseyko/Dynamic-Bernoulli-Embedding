 OBJECTIVE: Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) reported up-regulated play multiple functions several cancers. Herein, investigated roles primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: Expression PDK1 protein examined immunohistochemical staining 102 samples primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma (pNPC) 31 samples chronic nasopharyngitis. relationships PDK1 expression levels clinical features prognosis NPC patients analyzed. RESULTS: PDK1 protein expression significantly greater pNPC tissues chronic nasopharyngitis tissues (P<0.01). addition, overexpression PDK1 associated advanced clinical stage (P<0.01), advanced N classification (P=0.024), distant metastasis (P=0.048). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated patients higher PDK1 expression significantly shorter overall survival (P=0.006), disease-free survival (P=0.015), loco-regional relapse-free survival (P=0.008), distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.017). Furthermore, multi-variate analysis showed PDK1 expression independent prognostic factor pNPC patients. CONCLUSION: PDK1 frequently upregulated pNPC may serve prognostic marker.
