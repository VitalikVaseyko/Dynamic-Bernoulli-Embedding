 BACKGROUND: Reproductive aging females characterized fluctuations precipitous decline estrogen levels, may lead reduction cognitive function age-associated neurodegenerative disorders. nature estrogen-mediated neuronal plasticity unknown reproductive aging. hypothesize estrogen treatment early middle-aged ovariectomized rats may exert specific effects brain modulating signaling pathways regulating metabolic enzymes, inflammatory markers, antioxidant status, cholinergic function survival signals. PURPOSE: investigate mechanisms estrogen-induced effects neuroprotection neuroinflammation involvement intracellular signaling pathways brain areas ovariectomized (OVX) middle-aged (MA) female rats. METHODS: Ovariectomized early female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=8/group) implanted 17beta-estradiol (E2) 30-day release pellets (0.6mug 300mug). end treatment period, frontal cortex (FC), striatum (STR), medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), hippocampus (HP) isolated examined expression tyrosine hydroxylase (p-TH), nerve growth factor (NGF), p-NF-kappaB (p50 p65)and p-ERK, p-CREB, p-Akt, activities cholinesterases antioxidant enzymes, key regulatory enzymes metabolic pathways, nitric oxide production. RESULTS: E2 enhanced p-TH expression FC HP, reduced NGF expression HP, suppressed p-NF-kappaB expression FC STR. also increased expression molecular markers (p-ERK, p-CREB p-Akt), nitric oxide production various brain areas, differentially regulating activities metabolic enzymes cholinesterases. CONCLUSION: Estrogen modulates neural inflammatory factors, intracellular markers depending brain areas may influence differential remodeling neuronal circuitry used develop therapeutic strategies cognitive impairment neurodegenerative disorders aging.
