 report describe automated system rapidly automatically mixes reagents records results, spectrophotometric changes. employs commercial diode array spectrophotometer novel dilution chamber flow stream allows repetitive spectrophotometric rate measurements accurately measured incremental substrate concentrations. applied enzyme kinetic studies, initial velocities 15 different substrate inhibitor concentrations, pH values, recorded minutes high reproducibility, i.e., standard deviations less 1%, high sensitivity. Reactions occur 8-microliters flow cell reagent consumption minimal. concentration incrementally diluted reagent cell measured directly means indicator dye added substrate. Michaelis-Menten parameters, inhibition constants, pH profiles determined several enzymes including dehydrogenases producing NADH, kinase requiring coupled assay, hydrolase, carboxypeptidase A, reaction produces small decrease absorbance.
