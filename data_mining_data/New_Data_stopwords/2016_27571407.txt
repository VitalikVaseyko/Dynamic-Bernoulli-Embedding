 HIF1alpha common component pathways involved control cellular metabolism role regulating immune cell effector functions. Additionally, HIF1alpha critical maturation dendritic cells activation cells. HIF1alpha induced LPS-activated macrophages, critically involved glycolysis induction proinflammatory genes, notably Il1b. mechanism LPS-stimulated HIF1alpha induction involves succinate, inhibits prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) also induced interacts promotes function HIF1alpha. another critical inflammatory cell type, Th17 cells, HIF1alpha acts via retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gammat (RORgammat) drive Th17 differentiation. HIF1alpha therefore key reprogrammer metabolism inflammatory cells promotes inflammatory gene expression.
