 PURPOSE: Like cancer cells, photoreceptor cells produce lactate aerobically, requiring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A). Cancer cells also use glycolytic intermediates biosynthesis. molecular switch controlling glycolytic flow thought isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2). Here, determined expression localization PKM2 LDH-A mammalian retina make comparisons brain. METHODS: Single- double-labeling immunohistochemistry PKM2, pyruvate kinase M1 (PKM1), LDH-A performed using retinal sections C57BL/6 mice, Sprague-Dawley rats, rabbits, marmosets, humans. Pyruvate kinase M1 PKM2 mRNA protein expression levels quantified rodent retina brain using qPCR immunoblotting. quaternary forms PKM2 rat retina also determined. RESULTS: Pyruvate kinase M2 present glial cells rod cone photoreceptors retina species exclusively localized glia brain. Pyruvate kinase M1 confined neurons retina brain. Lactate dehydrogenase principally found photoreceptors inner portion avascular rabbit retina. Western blotting qPCR confirmed high levels PKM2 LDH-A retina. 6- 9-fold greater expression PKM2 mRNA rodent retina brain. dimeric (inactive, biosynthesis-driving form) active tetrameric (glycolytic-driving) forms PKM2 present retina brain. CONCLUSIONS: Mammalian photoreceptors contain dimeric tetrameric PKM2 LDH-A. consistent ability switch energy production biosynthesis like proliferating tissue, possibly due demands opsin synthesis.
