 activities two key enzymes glycolysis two key enzymes gluconeogenesis measured liver samples 44 human fetuses ranging gestational age 20 weeks term, infants 10 years adults 21 58 years. Specific activities gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, increased throughout period fetal development examined, rose near adult levels birth. activities glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase 1 pyruvate kinase, lower fetal pediatric adult samples. enzymes, significant reduction activity livers fetuses 34-37 weeks' gestation. enzymes showed hyperbolic kinetics 24 weeks' gestation, changed sigmoid kinetics 34-37 weeks' period low activity. data indicate last weeks gestation, inhibition activities two glycolytic enzymes, coupled rise two gluconeogenic enzymes, may reflect change liver primarily glycolytic role first two trimesters gluconeogenic role shortly birth.
