 Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induces invasive properties epithelial tumors promotes metastasis. Although EMT-mediated cellular molecular changes well understood, little known EMT-induced metabolic changes. HER2-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells induced undergo stable EMT using mammosphere culture, previously described us ERalpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Two epithelial breast cancer cell lines (BT-474 MCF-7) compared respective EMT-derived mesenchymal progeny (BT-474(EMT) MCF-7(EMT)) changes metabolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, anabolic pathways gluconeogenesis. EMT-derived cells displayed enhanced aerobic glycolysis along overexpression specific glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenase isoforms, monocarboxylate transporters glycogen phosphorylase isoform. contrast, EMT-derived cells suppressed expression crucial enzymes anabolic pathways gluconeogenesis. STAT3, transcription factor involved tumor initiation progression, plays role EMT-related changes expression specific enzymes transporters. study provides broad overview similar metabolic changes induced EMT two independent breast cancer cell lines. metabolic changes may provide novel therapeutic targets metastatic breast cancer.
