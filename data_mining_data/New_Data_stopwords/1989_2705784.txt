 Steady-state kinetic studies differing divalent metals ions carried pyruvate kinase-catalyzed, divalent cation-dependent decarboxylation oxalacetate probe role divalent metal ion reaction. either Mn2+ Co2+, initial velocity patterns show divalent metal ion bound enzyme rapid equilibrium prior addition oxalacetate. Further, change initial velocity patterns kinetic parameters presence absence K+, indicating K+ required oxalacetate decarboxylation. Dead-end inhibition decarboxylation reaction physiological substrate phosphoenolpyruvate indicates phosphoenolpyruvate binds enzyme-metal ion complex free enzyme. pKi values Mn2+ Co2+ decrease pK 7.0, increase pK 8.9. Since pK values ions, observed pK values must attributable enzymatic residues. pK 7.0 presumably ligand metal ion, pK 8.9 probably lysine involved enolization pyruvate normal physiological reaction. However, Co2+ divalent cation, V oxalacetate decreases pK 8.0, V/K decreases two pK values averaging 7.8, pKi oxalate decreases single pK 7.3. data indicate metal-coordinated water displaced binding substrates inhibitors pK value observed V V/K pH profiles (pK 8.3 Co2+ 9.2 Mg2+) enzymatic residue whose deprotonation disrupts charge distribution active site decreases activity.
