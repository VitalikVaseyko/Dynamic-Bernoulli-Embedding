 Proteomics represents powerful tool analysis mammalian spermatozoa, since terminally differentiated cells transcriptionally inactive exhibit limited dynamic range protein expression. report identification 5123 peptides, leading 829 unambiguous 2215 redundant gene products found present within rat spermatozoa derived cauda epididymis. Bioinformatics demonstrated 60 proteins appeared specifically expressed genitourinary tract, including pyruvate dehydrogenase 1, ropporin, testis-specific serine kinase 4, testis-specific transporter, retinol dehydrogenase 14. also identified eight members ADAM family, seven previously detected spermatozoa (ADAM2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -30) ADAM34 identified sperm proteome first time. Approximately 21 gene products found possess isomerase activity including peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerases known involved germ cell differentiation protein disulfide isomerases implicated sperm-oocyte fusion. Furthermore, 51 gene products clustered ion-transporter activity. inventory gene products, first ever 2-D LC-MS/MS analysis rat spermatozoa, invaluable directing future research molecular mechanisms drive highly specialized cells.
