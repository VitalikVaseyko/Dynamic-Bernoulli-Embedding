 Heat acclimatization induced group healthy male test subjects repetitive treadmill walking (5.6 km-h-1, 49 degrees/27 degrees C dry/wet bulb, 90 min-day-1, 7 days). second group men, paired maximal O2 consumption body weight, remained sedentary identical environmental conditions. Total plasma protein increased significantly 45 (P less 0.05) 90 (P less 0.025) min exercise first day heat exposure, yet 7 days increments occurred. Even heat acclimatization achieved (day 7), plasma levels creatine phosphokinase increased 90-min walk heat (time vs. 90, P less 0.025), also case day 1 (P less 0.05). Levels lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase significantly affected exercise heat either heat acclimatization. correlations could drawn base-line enzyme levels state physical conditioning.
