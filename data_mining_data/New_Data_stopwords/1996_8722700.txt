 Earlier work laboratory determined glucose plays important role mechanisms regulating meiotic maturation mammalian oocytes. current study, explored role glucose hormone-induced germinal vesicle breakdown (GVB) effort better understand glucose utilization metabolism relate control meiotic maturation mouse cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes (CEO). CEO cultured medium containing 4 mM hypoxanthine (to maintain meiotic arrest), 5.5 mM glucose, 0.23 mM pyruvate, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulated lactate accumulation time-dependent manner. Addition 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) medium various times initiation culture resulted rapid termination lactate production suppression FSH-induced GVB scored 18 hr culture, effectiveness diminishing longer delay addition 2-DG. 8 hr, addition 2-DG without effect GVB. Similar effects seen FSH-treated CEO washed free glucose. 2-DG dose-response experiment, gonadotropin-induced lactate production prevented, inhibition necessarily prevent GVB. activities six metabolic enzymes measured extracts freshly isolated complexes, order increasing activity were: hexokinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. six enzymes examined, hexokinase activity increased CEO exposed FSH. CEO cultured microdrops presence absence FSH, aliquots microdrop assayed glucose, lactate, pyruvate. response FSH, utilization glucose microdrop cultures CEO markedly increased accompanied comparable lactate production limited pyruvate production. Cycloheximide alpha-amanitin blocked FSH-induced oocyte maturation, cycloheximide prevented increase hexokinase activity glucose consumption. data suggest hexokinase important rate-limiting enzyme glucose utilization translational control participates mechanisms controlling reinitiation meiosis. However, stimulation glycolytic activity appear necessary concomitant meiotic induction.
