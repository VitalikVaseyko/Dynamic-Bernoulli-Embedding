 series benign semimalignant connective tissue proliferations (4 desmoids, 1 recurrence dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 4 fibromas, 1 neurofibroma, 3 keloids, 3 Dupuytren's contractures) normal fascia comparison pattern 18 enzymes different metabolic pathways investigated. clarified whether alterations enzyme pattern wouldoccur, asthey found malignant tumours. activity enzymes investigated increased twofold latter two extirpations (16 months interval) recurring desmoid. recurrence dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans recurrance fibroma remarkably high activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase found. High activities enzymes known characteristic experimental tumours animals human malignant neoplasms. Therefore assumed differences normal patternof enzyme activity related recidivity may regarded first signs deviation benignity.
