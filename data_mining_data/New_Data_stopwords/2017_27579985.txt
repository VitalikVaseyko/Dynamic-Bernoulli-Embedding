 Ethyl pyruvate, known ROS scavenger anti-inflammatory drug found combat leukemia cells. Tumor cell killing achieved concerted action necrosis/apoptosis induction, ATP depletion, inhibition glycolytic para-glycolytic enzymes. Ethyl lactate less harmful leukemia cells found arrest cell cycle G0/G1 phase. Both, ethyl pyruvate ethyl lactate identified new inhibitors GSK-3beta. Despite strong effect ethyl pyruvate leukemia cells, human cognate blood cells marginally affected. data compiled immune blotting, flow cytometry, enzyme activity assay gene array analysis. results inform new mechanisms ethyl pyruvate-induced cell death, offering thereby new treatment regime high therapeutic window leukemic tumors.
