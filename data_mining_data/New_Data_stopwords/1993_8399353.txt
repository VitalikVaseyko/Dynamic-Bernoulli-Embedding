 effect experimental hypothyroidism absorption, transmural transport metabolism glucose studied perfusion isolated loops rat jejunum vitro. expressed dry weight basis, rate absorption enhanced 32% (P < 0.01); expressed length basis significant change, since enhancement per unit weight almost exactly compensated diminution mass per unit length hypothyroid state. expressed either units, significant enhancement transmural transport (+123% +77%, respectively, P < 0.001), reflected part diminution rate glucose utilization (-29%, P < 0.01 -43%, P < 0.001, respectively). changes glucose utilization matched changes lactate production. Three factors contributed diminution glucose utilization hypothyroid state: diminution concentration 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (-35%, P < 0.05), increase S0.5 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase fructose 6-phosphate 0.4 0.6 mM fall mucosal concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (-56%, P < 0.05). point view whole animal, little change capacity intestine absorb glucose lumen, large enhancement transmural transport metabolically driven.
