 Incubation sickle cells cystamine, thiol reagnet, resulted formation intracellular S-ethylamine derivative. rate reaction dependent upon cystamine concentration, temperature, duration incubation. cystamine-treated cells demonstrated marked inhibition sickling hypoxic conditions, decrease mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, significant increase oxygen affinity. oxygen affinity cells less dependent mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration untreated sickle cells. minimum gelling concentration S-ethylamine doxyhemoglobin slightly increased. Cystamine affect intracellular pH 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level. exact contribution interrelated factors cystamine inhibition sickling (changes oxygen affinity, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, minimum gelling concentration) yet determined.
