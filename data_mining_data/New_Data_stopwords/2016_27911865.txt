 Aerobic glycolysis one emerging hallmarks cancer cells. study, investigated relationship blocking mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) MPC blocker UK5099 metabolic alteration well aggressive features esophageal squamous carcinoma. found blocking pyruvate transportation mitochondria attenuated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) triggered aerobic glycolysis, feature Warburg effect. addition, HIF-1alpha expression ROS production also activated upon UK5099 application. revealed UK5099-treated cells became significantly resistant chemotherapy radiotherapy, UK5099-treated tumor cells also exhibited stronger invasive capacity compared parental cells. contrast esophageal squamous epithelium cells, decreased MPC protein expression observed series 157 human squamous cell carcinomas, low/negative MPC1 expression predicted unfavorable clinical outcome. results together revealed potential connection altered MPC expression/activity Warburg metabolic reprogramming tumor aggressiveness cell lines clinical samples. Collectively, findings highlighted therapeutic strategy targeting Warburg reprogramming human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
