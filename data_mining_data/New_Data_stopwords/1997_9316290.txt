 Gaucher disease (GD) caused 50 mutations gene glucocerebrosidase (D-glucosyl acylsphingosine glucohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.45). 1448T C mutation found among ethnic groups. Ashkenazi Jews, patients homozygous 1448C mutation associated neuropathic form disease, case Japanese patients. present study analysis two haplotypes, Pv1.1 liver/erythrocytes pyruvate kinase (PKLR), Japanese GD patients homo- heterozygous 1448C mutation, comparison results ethnic patients genotypes order show ethnic differences. 28 patients, 20 type disease (7 homozygous 1448C), five type II (1 homozygous) 3 type III (all heterozygous). Japanese GD patients 1448C mutation, two haplotypes showed complete matching (+) (-). Pv1.1/PKLR(+) alleles accounted 84.0% frequency opposite reported Ashkenazi Jews Caucasians. 1448C homozygous state showed obvious linkage either haplotypes. haplotype analysis, postulated origin 1448C mutation Japanese GD patients different reported ethnic groups.
