 1. activity pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase assayed incorporation [(32)P]phosphate [gamma-(32)P]ATP dehydrogenase complex. close correlation incorporation loss pyruvate dehydrogenase activity preparations studied. 2. Nucleoside triphosphates ATP (at 100mum) cyclic 3':5'-nucleotides (at 10mum) significant effect kinase activity. 3. K(m) thiamin pyrophosphate pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 0.76mum. Sodium pyrophosphate, adenylyl imidodiphosphate, ADP GTP competitive inhibitors thiamin pyrophosphate dehydrogenase reaction. 4. K(m) ATP intrinsic kinase assayed three preparations pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase range 13.9-25.4mum. Inhibition ADP adenylyl imidodiphosphate predominantly competitive, nevertheless definite non-competitive element. Thiamin pyrophosphate sodium pyrophosphate uncompetitive inhibitors ATP. suggested ADP adenylyl imidodiphosphate inhibit kinase mainly binding ATP site adenosine moiety may involved binding. suggested thiamin pyrophosphate, sodium pyrophosphate, adenylyl imidodiphosphate ADP may inhibit kinase binding pyrophosphate imidodiphosphate moieties site ATP site. known whether coenzyme-binding site pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. 5. K(m) pyruvate pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 35.5mum. 2-Oxobutyrate 3-hydroxypyruvate glyoxylate also substrates; three compounds inhibited pyruvate oxidation. 6. preparations pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase free thiamin pyrophosphate, pyruvate inhibited kinase reaction concentrations range 25-500mum. inhibition uncompetitive. presence thiamin pyrophosphate (endogenous added 2 10mum) kinase activity enhanced low concentrations pyruvate (25-100mum) inhibited high concentration (500mum). Activation kinase reaction seen sodium pyrophosphate substituted thiamin pyrophosphate. 7. conditions kinase assay, pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase forms (14)CO(2) [1-(14)C]pyruvate presence thiamin pyrophosphate. Previous work suggests products may include acetoin. Acetoin activated kinase reaction presence thiamin pyrophosphate sodium pyrophosphate. suggested acetoin formation may contribute activation kinase reaction low pyruvate concentrations presence thiamin pyrophosphate. 8. Pyruvate effected conversion pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate pyruvate dehydrogenase rat heart mitochondria incubated 5mm-2-oxoglutarate 0.5mm-l-malate respiratory substrates. suggested effect pyruvate due inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase reaction mitochondrion. 9. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity inhibited high concentrations Mg(2+) (15mm) Ca(2+) (10nm-10mum) low Mg(2+) (0.15mm) high Mg(2+) (15mm).
