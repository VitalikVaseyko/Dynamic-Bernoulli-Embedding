 Monolayers liver cells cultured postnatal rats grown two types media. One set cultures grown selective medium contained ornithine deficient arginine; set grown nonselective medium contained arginine ornithine. cultures grown nonselective medium contained primarily mixture two cell types found liver: parenchymal hepatocytes fibroblast-like cells. fibroblast cells tended overgrow hepatocytes several days culture. contrast, fibroblast overgrowth inhibited cultures grown selective, arginine-deficient medium, thereby resulting relatively pure cultures functional parenchymal hepatocytes. Comparative studies sulfobromophthalein (BSP) uptake showed cultures grown selective medium continued active much longer cultures grown nonselective medium. Pyruvate kinase assays revealed cultures grown selective medium contained primarily L-isoenzyme type characteristic parenchymal hepatocytes. Cultures grown nonselective medium contained mixture L- M-isoenzymes indicative nonparenchymal liver cells. reported results indicate selective, arginine-deficient medium permits primarily growth parenchymal hepatocytes found neonatal rat liver.
