 Tumor cells known propensity proliferate uncontrollably generate multitudes metastatic masses advanced stages cancer. progression, tumor cells switch energy source mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation glucose-dependent glycolytic pathway, despite availability oxygen. Consequently, tumor cells increase metabolic rates well glucose uptake maintain proliferation. atypical metabolic phenomenon known Warburg effect, recognized hallmark cancer serves promising target diagnosis therapy cancer. review, summarize current advances toward development glucose-derived therapeutic diagnostic agents (theranostics) cancer.
