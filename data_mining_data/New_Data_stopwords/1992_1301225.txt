 1988, using powerful cDNA/PCR technique, demonstrated low levels dystrophin mRNA variety non-muscle tissues, including cultured fibroblasts lymphoblastoid cell lines. phenomenon also shown number tissue-specific gene, including beta-globin, factors VIIIc IX, anti-mullerian hormone, L-pyruvate kinase, retinal blue pigment, phenylalanine hydroxylase. level transcript inappropriate cells exceedingly low, perhaps one mRNA per 100-1,000 cells. low-level ubiquitous transcription tissue-specific genes called "illegitimate" "ectopic" transcription, proven occur 17 gene transcripts date. mechanism biological significance illegitimate transcription still obscure, but, since illegitimate transcripts exhibit pathology legitimate transcripts, useful tool study already 9 inherited diseases. strategy applied widely diseases samples appropriate tissue study difficult obtain, mRNA easier informative study genomic DNA (as large genes, alternative splicings involved).
