 Glioma stemmed glial cells brain, accounted 45% intracranial tumors. characteristic glioma invasive growth, well obvious boundary normal brain tissue glioma tissue, difficult resect completely worst prognosis. metabolism glioma following Warburg effect. Previous researches shown GLUT1, glucose transporter carrier, affected Warburg effect, molecular mechanism clear. CREB1 (cAMP responsive element-binding protein1) involved various biological processes, relevant studies confirmed CREB1 protein regulated expression GLUT1, thus mediating glucose transport cells. experiments mainly reveal CREB1 could affect glucose transport glioma cells regulating expression GLUT1, controlled metabolism glioma affected progression glioma.
