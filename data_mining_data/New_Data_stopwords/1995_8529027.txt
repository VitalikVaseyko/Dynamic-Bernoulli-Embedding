 ability glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, pyruvate kinase (PK), lactate dehydrogenase muscle-type (LDH(M)), generate interactive microtubule networks investigated. Bundles previously defined parallel alignment several microtubules one form microtubule networks. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy, interactive networks microtubules well bundles readily observed presence GAPDH, aldolase, PK. networks appear morphologically cross-linked microtubules, oriented many different ways. Light scattering indicated muscle forms GAPDH, aldolase, PK LDH(m) caused formation microtubule networks. Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) lactate dehydrogenase heart-type (LDH(H)), glycolytic enzymes interact tubulin microtubules, produce bundles, interactive networks. Sedimentation experiments confirmed enzymes cross-link also co-pellet microtubules. cross-linking microtubules indicate enzymes multivalent capability simultaneous binding one microtubule.
