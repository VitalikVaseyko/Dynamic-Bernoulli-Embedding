 assimilation NH(4) (+) causes rapid increase respiration provided carbon skeletons amino acid synthesis. study propose model regulation carbon partitioning starch respiration N assimilation green alga Selenastrum minutum. provide evidence cytosolic plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. cytosolic form inhibited AMP fructose-1,6-bisphosphate plastidic form inhibited phosphate. one ATP dependent phosphofructokinase which, based immunological cross reactivity, identified localized plastid. inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate activated phosphate. pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase found. initiation dark ammonium assimilation resulted transient increase ADP releases pyruvate kinase adenylate control. activation pyruvate kinase causes rapid 80% drop phosphoenolpyruvate 2.7-fold increase pyruvate. pyruvate kinase mediated decrease phosphoenolpyruvate correlates activation ATP dependent phosphofructokinase increasing carbon flow upper half glycolysis. increased concentration triosephosphate provided substrate pyruvate kinase. suggested increase triosephosphate coupled glutamine synthetase mediated decline glutamate, serves maintain pyruvate kinase activation ADP levels recover. initiation NH(4) (+) assimilation causes transient 60% increase fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. Given sensitivity cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase regulator, increase would serve inhibit cytosolic gluconeogenesis direct triosephosphate exported plastid glycolysis amino acid biosynthesis.
