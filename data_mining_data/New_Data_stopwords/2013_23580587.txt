 metabolism sustains cancer cells adapted preferentially glycolysis, even aerobic conditions (Warburg effect). effect one first alterations cancer cells recognized conferring survival advantage. study, show gene associated retinoid-interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19), previously identified tumor suppressor protein associated growth inhibition cell apoptosis, contributes switch oxidative glycolytic pathways. parallel this, vascular endothelial growth factor, promotes neovascularization, also regulated. identified hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) downstream factor GRIM-19 human glioblastoma cell lines. Downregulation GRIM-19 promotes HIF1alpha synthesis STAT3-dependent manner, acts potential competitive inhibitor von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL)-HIF1alpha interaction, thereby prevents HIF1alpha pVHL-mediated ubiquitination proteasomal degradation. Taken together, concluded GRIM-19, potential tumor suppressor gene, performs function part via regulating glioblastoma metabolic reprogramming STAT3-HIF1alpha signaling axis, added new perspective role tumorigenesis, thus providing potential strategies tumor metabolic therapy.
