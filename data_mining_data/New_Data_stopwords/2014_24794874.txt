 Trypanosoma brucei belongs group protists sequester first six seven glycolytic steps inside specialized peroxisomes, named glycosomes. glycosomal membrane impermeability nucleotides, ATP molecules consumed first glycolytic steps need regenerated glycosomes kinases, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), reversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate, could also involved process. address question, analyzed metabolism main carbon sources used procyclic trypanosomes (glucose, proline, threonine) deletion PPDK gene wild-type (Deltappdk) PEPCK null (Deltappdk/Deltapepck) backgrounds. rate acetate production glucose 30% reduced Deltappdk mutant, whereas threonine-derived acetate production affected, showing PPDK function glycolytic direction production ATP glycosomes. Deltappdk/Deltapepck mutant incubated glucose carbon source showed 3.8-fold reduction glycolytic rate compared Deltapepck mutant, consequence imbalanced glycosomal ATP/ADP ratio. role PPDK maintenance ATP/ADP balance confirmed expressing glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC) Deltappdk/Deltapepck cell line, restored glycolytic flux. also observed expression PGKC lethal procyclic trypanosomes, consequence ATP depletion, due glycosomal relocation cytosolic ATP production. illustrates key roles played glycosomal cytosolic kinases, including PPDK, maintain cellular ATP/ADP homeostasis.
