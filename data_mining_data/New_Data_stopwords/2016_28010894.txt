 majority human tumours comprised cancerous epithelial cells coexist multitude different cell types extracellular matrix components creating cancer microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) abundant mesenchymal cell types present within human carcinomas. Recent evidence suggests nutrient deprived epithelial cancer cells able survive conditions, result ability undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming exploit metabolic capacities surrounding CAFs. Although several studies support role CAFs tumour progression metastasis, molecular mechanisms underlying pro-tumourigenic interaction remains elucidated. review discuss complex metabolic interaction exists epithelial cancer cells CAF's: focussing primarily functional role tumour progression, metastasis chemotherapeutic resistance. Attempts made delineating molecular mechanisms underlying pro-tumourigenic interaction, potential CAF-based targets suggested.
