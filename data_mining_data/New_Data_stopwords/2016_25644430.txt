 Rhadomyosarcoma (RMS) common soft tissue sarcoma childhood. RMS cells resemble fetal myoblasts unable complete myogenic differentiation. previous work showed miR-206, low RMS, induced RMS cells promotes resumption differentiation modulating 700 genes. better define pathways involved conversion RMS cells differentiated counterpart, focused 2 miR-206 effectors emerged microarray analysis, SMYD1 G6PD. SMYD1, one highly upregulated genes, H3K4 histone methyltransferase. show SMYD1 silencing interfere proliferative block loss anchorage independence imposed miR-206, severely impairs differentiation ERMS, ARMS, myogenic cells. Thus SMYD1 essential activation muscle genes. Conversely, among downregulated genes, found G6PD, enzyme catalyzing rate-limiting step pentose phosphate shunt. work, confirmed G6PD direct target miR-206. Moreover, showed G6PD silencing ERMS cells impairs proliferation soft agar growth. However, G6PD overexpression interfere pro-differentiating effect miR-206, suggesting G6PD downmodulation contributes - absolute requirement - tumor suppressive potential miR-206. Targeting cancer metabolism may enhance differentiation. However, therapeutic inhibition G6PD encumbered side effects. alternative, used DCA combination miR-206 increase flux pyruvate mitochondrion reactivating PDH. DCA enhanced inhibition RMS cell growth induced miR-206, sustained upon miR-206 de-induction. Altogether results link miR-206 epigenetic metabolic reprogramming, suggest may worth combining differentiation-inducing metabolism-directed approaches.
