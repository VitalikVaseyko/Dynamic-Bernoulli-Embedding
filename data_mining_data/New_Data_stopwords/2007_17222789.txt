 unique metabolic profile cancer (aerobic glycolysis) might confer apoptosis resistance therapeutically targeted. Compared normal cells, several human cancers high mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) low expression K+ channel Kv1.5, contributing apoptosis resistance. Dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), shifts metabolism glycolysis glucose oxidation, decreases DeltaPsim, increases mitochondrial H2O2, activates Kv channels cancer, normal, cells; DCA upregulates Kv1.5 NFAT1-dependent mechanism. DCA induces apoptosis, decreases proliferation, inhibits tumor growth, without apparent toxicity. Molecular inhibition PDK2 siRNA mimics DCA. mitochondria-NFAT-Kv axis PDK important therapeutic targets cancer; orally available DCA promising selective anticancer agent.
