 Addition glucagon isolated hepatocytes reduced activity 6-phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). Phosphorylation contributed inhibition pyruvate kinase, several lines evidence indicated reaction responsible inhibition phosphofructokinase. First, increase phosphorylation intact cells induced increasing concentration glucagon correlate well decrease enzyme activity. Second, phosphorylation phosphofructokinase induced addition cyclic AMP Mg2+-ATP addition Mg2+-ATP catalytic subunit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase hepatocyte extracts effect enzyme activity. Third, ammonium sulfate precipitation enzyme extracts cells incubated glucagon abolished hormone effect. effect could restored, however, addition phosphofructokinase-free extract glucagon-treated cells ammonium sulfate-treated enzyme either untreated glucagon-treated cells. results suggest inhibition phosphofructokinase glucagon due changes level allosteric effector(s).
