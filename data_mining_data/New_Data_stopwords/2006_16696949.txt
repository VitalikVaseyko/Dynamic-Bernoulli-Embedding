 Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK; E.C. 2.7.9.1) catalyzes synthesis primary inorganic carbon acceptor, phosphoenolpyruvate C4 photosynthetic pathway reversibly regulated light. PPDK regulatory protein (RP), bifunctional serine/threonine kinase-phosphatase, catalyzes ADP-dependent inactivation Pi-dependent activation PPDK. Attempts clone RP date proven unsuccessful. bioinformatics approach taken identify nucleotide amino acid sequence protein. Based previously established characteristics including molecular mass, known inter- intracellular location, functionality, low level expression, available databases interrogated ultimately identify single candidate gene. paper, describe nucleotide deduced amino acid sequence gene establish identity maize PPDK RP vitro analysis catalytic properties via cloning expression recombinant protein.
