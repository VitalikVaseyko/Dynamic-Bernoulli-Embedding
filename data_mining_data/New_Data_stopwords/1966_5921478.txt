 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity determined lactate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay. effects modifications buffer substrate concentrations studied. Three patients congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia deficient erythrocyte PK, evidently homozygous deficiency. daughter one patient parents another intermediate PK levels probably heterozygous. erythrocyte adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level low one patient, high another. Adenosine triphosphatase activity erythrocyte membranes one patient normal.
