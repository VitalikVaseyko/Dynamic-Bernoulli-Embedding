 Corticosteroids (CS) effects insulin resistance related genes rat skeletal muscle studied. acute study, adrenalectomized (ADX) rats given single doses 50 mg/kg methylprednisolone (MPL) intravenously. chronic study, ADX rats implanted Alzet mini-pumps giving zero-order release rates 0.3 mg/kg/h MPL sacrificed various times 7 days. Total RNA extracted gastrocnemius muscles hybridized Affymetrix GeneChips. Data mining literature searches identified 6 insulin resistance related genes exhibited complex regulatory pathways. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4), fatty acid translocase (FAT) glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) dynamic profiles modeled mutual effects calculated nuclear drug-receptor complex (DR(N)) transcription factors. oscillatory feature endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression depicted negative feedback loop. integrated models provide testable quantitative hypotheses regulatory cascades.
