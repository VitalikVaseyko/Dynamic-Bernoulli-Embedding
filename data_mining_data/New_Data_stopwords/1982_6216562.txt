 Kinetic characteristics glycolytic kinases cells erythrocytic line studied rats. Erythrocyte Hexokinase (HK) shows low Km, reticulocytes high Km enzyme also found. low Km HK inhibited higher physiological concentrations 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. ATP inhibition 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) erythrocytes reticulocytes, deinhibitory effect shown AMP cyclic-AMP, lower situ vitro. sigmoidal fructose-6-phosphate saturation curve PFK observed vitro situ. approach enzyme shows hyperbolic kinetics, lower response positive allosteric effectors decrease activity. antagonistic effect shown cyclic-AMP cyclic-GMP vitro sigmoidal behaviour PFK. Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) hyperbolic enzyme, similar Km values, erythrocytes, reticulocytes bone marrow cells. Pyruvate kinase shows sigmoidal kinetics activation fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) erythrocytes; non rectangular hyperbolic kinetics negative cooperativity, lack response FBP inhibition ATP L-alanine, observed bone marrow enzyme.
