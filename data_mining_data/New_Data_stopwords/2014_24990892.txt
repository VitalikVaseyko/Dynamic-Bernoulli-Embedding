 disruption energy production important contributor renal injury, metabolic alterations sepsis-induced AKI remain understudied. assessed changes renal cortical glycolytic metabolism mouse model sepsis-induced AKI. specific rapid increase hexokinase (HK) activity ( approximately 2-fold) observed 3 h LPS exposure maintained 18 h, association decline renal function measured blood urea nitrogen (BUN). LPS-induced HK activation occurred independently HK isoform expression mitochondrial localization. changes glycolytic enzymes observed. LPS-mediated HK activation sufficient increase glycolytic flux indicated reduced unchanged pyruvate lactate levels renal cortex. LPS-induced HK activation associated increased glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity glycogen production. Mechanistically, LPS-induced HK activation attenuated pharmacological inhibitors EGF receptor (EGFR) Akt, indicating EGFR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling responsible. findings reveal LPS rapidly increases renal cortical HK activity EGFR- Akt-dependent manner HK activation linked increased pentose phosphate pathway activity.
