 anti-tumoral effects cannabinoids described different tumor systems, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mechanism action remains unclear. used cannabinoids specific CB1 (ACPA) CB2 (GW) receptors metabolomic analyses unravel potential pathways mediating cannabinoid-dependent inhibition pancreatic cancer cell growth. Panc1 cells treated cannabinoids show elevated AMPK activation induced ROS-dependent increase AMP/ATP ratio. ROS promote nuclear translocation GAPDH, amplified AMPK, thereby attenuating glycolysis. Furthermore, ROS determine accumulation NADH, suggestive blockage respiratory chain, turn inhibits Krebs cycle. Concomitantly, inhibition Akt/c-Myc pathway leads decreased activity pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), downregulating glycolysis, glutamine uptake. Altogether, alterations pancreatic cancer cell metabolism mediated cannabinoids result strong induction autophagy inhibition cell growth.
