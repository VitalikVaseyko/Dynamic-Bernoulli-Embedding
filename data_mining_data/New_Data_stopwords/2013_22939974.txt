 Metabolic derangements bioenergetic failure major contributors sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunctions. Due well known role magnesium (Mg) cofactor many enzymatic reactions involve energy creation utilization, present investigation directed estimate cardioprotective effect Mg supplementation lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced metabolic energy changes mice. Oral doses Mg aspartate (20 40 mg/kg) administered daily 7 day. Mice subjected single intraperitoneal injection LPS (2 mg/kg). Plasma separated 3 h LPS injection determination creatine kinase-MB activity. Animals sacrificed hearts separated estimation tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione, lactate, pyruvate, adenine nucleotides, creatine phosphate cardiac Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Finally, electron microscopic examination performed visualize protective effects Mg pretreatment mitochondrial ultrastructure. general, higher dose Mg effective lower dose ameliorating creatine kinase-MB elevation state oxidative stress, lactate accumulation, pyruvate reduction well preserving creatine phosphate, adenine nucleotides Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Moreover, higher dose Mg provided significant cardioprotection mitochondrial ultrastructural changes. Mg therapy afford significant protection metabolic energy derangements mitochondrial ultrastructural changes induced LPS cardiotoxicity mice.
