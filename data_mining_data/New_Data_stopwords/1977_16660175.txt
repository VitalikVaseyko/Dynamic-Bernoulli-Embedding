 Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., var. El Unico) leaf discs, floating buffer containing NH(4)Cl photosynthesizing (14)CO(2), produced labeled amino acid less sucrose control discs (no added NH(4)Cl). level pyruvate increased phosphoenolpyruvate decreased. changes levels labeled compounds led us conclude pyruvate kinase activated ammonia, resulting increased transfer photosynthetically incorporated carbon synthesis amino acid skeletons expense sucrose synthesis. Carbon flow enzymes catalyzing anaplerotic reactions apparently stimulated.
