 Herein describe novel survival pathway operationally links alternative pre-mRNA splicing hypoxia-inducible death protein Bcl-2 19-kD interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) unique glycolytic phenotype cancer cells. full-length Bnip3 protein (Bnip3FL) encoded exons 1-6 expressed isoform normal cells promoted cell death, truncated spliced variant Bnip3 mRNA deleted exon 3 (Bnip3Deltaex3) preferentially expressed several human adenocarcinomas promoted survival. Reciprocal inhibition Bnip3Deltaex3/Bnip3FL isoform ratio inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK2) Panc-1 cells rapidly induced mitochondrial perturbations cell death. findings present study reveal novel survival pathway functionally couples unique glycolytic phenotype cancer cells hypoxia resistance via PDK2-dependent mechanism switches Bnip3 cell death survival. Discovery survival Bnip3Deltaex3 isoform may fundamentally explain certain cells resist Bnip3 avert death hypoxia.
