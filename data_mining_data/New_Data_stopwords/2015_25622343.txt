 Carbon dioxide known time one products carbohydrate metabolism. recently demonstrated CO2 utilized pathways carbohydrate synthesis. Five reactions described CO2 incorporated citric acid intermediates. Two important functions CO2 fixation reactions suggested. Citric acid cycle intermediates generated fixation reactions schemes utilizing two reaction reverse pyruvic kinase reaction. latter step essential glucogenesis. paper shows carbon dioxide fixation occurs rat skin. labeling pattern oxaloacetate fixation consistent patterns predicted either malic enzyme propionyl carboxylase fixation reactions. presence phosphopyruvic carboxykinase pyruvic carboxylase reactions cannot definitely ruled experimental data. work enzymatic level show significance various fixaon reactions skin. experiments may also elucidate relationship factors known affect fixation reactions also produce gross microscopic changes skin.
