 effect pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) deficiency glucose homeostasis studied mice fed high-fat diet. Expression PDK4 greatly increased skeletal muscle diaphragm liver kidney wild-type mice fed high-fat diet. Wild-type PDK4(-/-) mice consumed similar amounts diet became equally obese. Insulin resistance developed groups. Nevertheless, fasting blood glucose levels lower, glucose tolerance slightly improved, insulin sensitivity slightly greater PDK4(-/-) mice compared wild-type mice. mice killed fed state, actual activity pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) higher skeletal muscle diaphragm liver kidney PDK4(-/-) mice compared wild-type mice. mice killed overnight fasting, actual PDC activity higher kidney PDK4(-/-) mice compared wild-type mice. concentrations gluconeogenic substrates lower blood PDK4(-/-) mice compared wild-type mice, consistent reduced formation peripheral tissues. Diaphragms isolated PDK4(-/-) mice oxidized glucose faster fatty acids slower diaphragms wild-type mice. Fatty acid oxidation inhibited glucose oxidation diaphragms wild-type PDK4(-/-) mice. NEFA, ketone bodies, branched-chain amino acids elevated PDK4(-/-) mice, consistent slower rates oxidation. findings show PDK4 deficiency lowers blood glucose slightly improves glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity mice diet-induced obesity.
