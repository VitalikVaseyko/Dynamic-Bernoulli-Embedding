 Endothelial cells function conditions different oxygen availability physiologic conditions variety pathologic states. determined effect normal low O2 tensions three key bioenergetic enzymes [pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40), phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 27.1.11) cytochrome aa3] culture-maintained endothelial cells derived calf pulmonary artery aorta. Endothelial cells derived pulmonary artery aorta demonstrate similar bioenergetic enzyme activities exposed PO2 vitro. Endothelial cells exposed hypoxia vitro 48-96 hr show significantly increase activities 2 key glycolytic enzymes: pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase. Freshly isolated intimal strips calf pulmonary artery (normal PO2 = 40 torr) show significantly greater activities PyKi aortic intimal strips (normal PO2 = 90 torr), suggesting similar pattern occurs vivo. data suggest cell types common bioenergetic pattern genetically determined pattern modified regulatory mechanisms geared ambient O2 tension. endothelial cells types uncommonly exposed hypoxic conditions, regulatory mechanisms may play important role maintaining vascular integrity.
