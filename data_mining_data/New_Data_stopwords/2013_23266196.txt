 report two families Sengers syndrome mutations acylglycerol kinase gene (AGK). first family, two brothers presented vascular strokes, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy cataracts, abnormal muscle cell histopathology mitochondrial function. One proband abnormal mitochondria citrate synthase crystals visible electron micrographs, associated markedly high citrate synthase activity. Exome sequencing used identify mutations AGK gene index patient. Targeted sequencing confirmed homozygous mutation (c.3G>A, p.M1I) brother. second family four affected members, examined two. also presented similar clinical symptoms, strokes. Postmortem heart skeletal muscle tissues showed low complex I, III IV activities heart, normal muscle. Skin fibroblasts showed elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios low complex I+III activity. Targeted sequencing led identification homozygous c.979A>T, p.K327* mutation. AGK located mitochondria phosphorylates monoacylglycerol diacylglycerol lysophosphatidic acid phosphatidic acid. Disruption signaling molecules affects mitochondria's response superoxide radicals, resulting oxidative damage mitochondrial DNA, lipids proteins, stimulation cellular detoxification pathways. High levels manganese superoxide dismutase protein detected four affected individuals, consistent increased free radical damage. Phosphatidic acid also involved synthesis phospholipids loss result changes lipid composition inner mitochondrial membrane. effects manifest cataract formation eye, respiratory chain dysfunction cardiac hypertrophy heart tissue. two pedigrees confirm mutation AGK responsible severe neonatal presentation Sengers syndrome. identification citrate synthase precipitates electron microscopy presence vascular strokes two siblings may expand cellular clinical phenotype disease.
