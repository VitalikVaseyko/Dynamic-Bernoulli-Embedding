 Decoding bioenergetic signature underlying embryonic stem cell cardiac differentiation revealed mandatory transformation metabolic infrastructure prominent mitochondrial network expansion distinctive switch glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation. Here, demonstrate despite reduction total glycolytic capacity, stem cell cardiogenesis engages significant transcriptome, proteome, well enzymatic topological rearrangement proximal, medial, distal modules glycolytic pathway. Glycolytic restructuring manifested shift hexokinase (Hk) isoforms Hk-2 cardiac Hk-1, intracellular intermyofibrillar localization mapping mitochondrial network arrangement. Moreover, upregulation cardiac-specific enolase 3, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucomutase marked increase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) phosphotransfer activity, along apparent post-translational modifications GAPDH phosphoglycerate kinase, distinctive derived cardiomyocytes compared embryonic stem cell source. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoforms evolved towards LDH-2 LDH-3, containing higher proportions heart-specific subunits, pyruvate dehydrogenase isoforms rearranged E1alpha E1beta, transitions favorable substrate oxidation mitochondria. Concomitantly, transcript levels fetal pyruvate kinase isoform M2, aldolase 3, transketolase, shunt glycolytic pentose phosphate pathways, reduced. Collectively, changes glycolytic pathway modules indicate active redeployment, would facilitate connectivity expanding mitochondrial network ATP utilization sites. Thus, delineated developmental dynamics glycolytic phosphotransfer network integral remodeling cellular energetic infrastructure underlying stem cell cardiogenesis.
