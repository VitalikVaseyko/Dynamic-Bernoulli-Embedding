 Pyruvate kinase catalyzes rate-limiting final step glycolysis, generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pyruvate. M2 tumor-specific isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes glucose uptake lactate production presence oxygen, known aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect. recently reported Nature, PKM2, besides metabolic function, nonmetabolic function direct control cell cycle progression activating beta-catenin inducing expression beta-catenin downstream gene CCND1(encoding cyclin D1). nonmetabolic function PKM2 essential epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation-induced tumorigenesis.
