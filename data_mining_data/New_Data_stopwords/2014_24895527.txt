 Although insulin known regulate glucose metabolism closely associate liver cancer, molecular mechanisms still remain elucidated. study, attempt understand mechanism insulin promotion liver cancer metabolism. found insulin increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulating glucose consumption lactate production, key process glycolysis hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 Bel7402 cells. Interestingly, insulin-induced ROS found responsible suppression miR-145 miR-128, forced expression either miR-145 miR-128 sufficient abolish insulin-induced PKM2 expression. Furthermore, knockdown PKM2 expression also inhibited cancer cell growth insulin-induced glucose consumption lactate production, suggesting PKM2 functional downstream effecter insulin. Taken together, study would provide new insight mechanism insulin-induced glycolysis.
