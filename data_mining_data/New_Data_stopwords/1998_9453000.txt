 Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binding studies effects DHT expression beta-glucuronidase (Gus) kidney androgen-regulated protein (KAP) genes cell growth investigated immortalized early PKSV-PCT late PKSV-PR proximal tubule cells, derived transgenic mice carrying L-pyruvate kinase/SV40 hybrid gene. [3H]DHT binding studies indicated cell lines conserved substantial amounts androgen receptors. levels KAP Gus transcripts PKSV-PCT cells, KAP transcripts PKSV-PR cells, decreased cells shifted serum-supplemented steroid-free medium. addition 30 nM DHT steroid-free medium resulted slight increase Gus marked increase KAP transcripts cell lines. Dihydrotestosterone also affected growth PKSV-PCT PKSV-PR cells, since hormone added steroid-free medium stimulated incorporation [3H]thymidine dose-dependent manner induced formation domes, represent indicators ionic transport processes. Thus, early late mouse proximal tubule cells conserved androgen receptors, represent attractive cell systems analyze action androgens specific functions mouse proximal tubule.
