 Enolase catalyses reversible conversion 2-phosphoglycerate phosphoenolpyruvate glycolysis. Phosphoenolpyruvate constitutes important branch point plant metabolism. converted pyruvate pyruvate kinase organic acids phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Phosphoenolpyruvate also acts precursor synthesis aromatic amino acids plastids. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) enolase antisense plants analysed changes metabolite composition, respiration photosynthetic parameters. Antisense repression resulted 95% reduction total enolase activity. also resulted fundamental changes foliar metabolism. Although 2-phosphoglycerate remained largely unaltered, substantial decrease phosphoenolpyruvate. levels aromatic amino acids secondary phenylpropanoid metabolites derived compounds decreased strongly, branched chain amino acids. level pyruvate unaltered, rate respiration. substantial increases tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, including 16-fold increase isocitrate, increase total free amino acid content, including 14-fold increase asparagine glutamine, 50% decrease free sugars. conclude decrease enolase activity affects secondary pathways, shikimate branch amino acid biosynthesis, inhibit rate respiration.
