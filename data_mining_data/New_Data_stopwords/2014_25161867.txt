 Previous studies impact hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] mammalian cell energetics revealed alterations suggestive shift fermentative metabolism. Aiming defined understanding metabolic effects Cr(VI) molecular basis, assessed impact mild Cr(VI) exposure critical bioenergetic parameters (lactate production, oxygen consumption intracellular ATP levels). Cells derived normal human bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B cell line), main vivo target Cr(VI) carcinogenicity, subjected 48 h 1 muM Cr(VI). could confirm shift fermentative metabolism, resulting simultaneous inhibition respiration stimulation glycolysis. shift accompanied decrease protein levels catalytic subunit (subunit beta) mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase (beta-F1-ATPase) concomitant marked increase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). corresponding alteration beta-F1-ATPase/GAPDH protein ratio (viewed bioenergetic signature) upon Cr(VI) exposure agreement observed attenuation cellular respiration enhancement glycolytic flux. Altogether, results constitute novel finding terms molecular mechanisms Cr(VI) effects.
