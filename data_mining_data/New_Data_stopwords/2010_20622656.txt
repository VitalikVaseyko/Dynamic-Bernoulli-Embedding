 OBJECTIVE: investigate effects preoperative feeding carbohydrate-based drink also contained glutamine antioxidants (oral nutritional supplement [ONS], Fresenuis Kabi, Germany) glycogen reserves, mitochondrial function, expression key metabolic genes proteins. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Preoperative carbohydrate loading attenuates decline postoperative insulin sensitivity cellular mechanisms underlying remain unclear. METHODS: Two groups 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy participated randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study. Patients received either 600 mL ONS placebo evening surgery, 300 mL 3 4 hours anesthesia. 300-mL aliquot ONS contained 50 g carbohydrate, 15 g glutamine antioxidants. Blood sampled ingestion evening drink, induction anesthesia, postoperative day 1 measurement concentrations glucose, glutamine, antioxidants. Rectus abdominis muscle liver biopsies performed intraoperatively determine glycogen glutamine concentrations, mitochondrial function, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4), forkhead transcription factor 1 (FOXO1), metallothionein 1A (Mt1A) expression. RESULTS: drink-related complications. ONS ingestion led increased intraoperative liver glycogen reserves (44%, P < 0.001) plasma glutamine antioxidant concentrations, latter 2 remaining elevated first postoperative day. Muscle PDK4 mRNA, PDK4 protein expression, Mt1A mRNA expression 4-fold (P < 0.001), 44% (P < 0.05), 1.5-fold (P < 0.001), respectively, lower ONS group. differences FOXO1 mRNA protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: changes muscle PDK4 may explain mechanism preoperative feeding carbohydrate-based drinks attenuates development postoperative insulin resistance.
