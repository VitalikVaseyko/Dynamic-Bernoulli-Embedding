 bone marrow environment among hypoxic body, hypoxia affects bone formation known. low oxygen tension stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) proteins, investigated effect expressing stabilized form HIF1alpha osteoblast precursors. Brief stabilization HIF1alpha SP7-positive cells postnatal mice dramatically stimulated cancellous bone formation via marked expansion osteoblast population. Remarkably, concomitant deletion vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) mouse diminish bone accrual caused HIF1alpha stabilization. Thus, HIF1alpha-driven bone formation independent VEGFA up-regulation increased angiogenesis. hand, HIF1alpha stabilization stimulated glycolysis bone up-regulation key glycolytic enzymes including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). Pharmacological inhibition PDK1 completely reversed HIF1alpha-driven bone formation vivo. Thus, HIF1alpha stimulates osteoblast formation direct activation glycolysis, alterations cellular metabolism may broadly applicable mechanism regulating cell differentiation.
