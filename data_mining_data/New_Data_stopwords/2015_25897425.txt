 Cancer cells need regulate metabolic program fuel several activities, including unlimited proliferation, resistance cell death, invasion metastasis. aim work revise complex scenario. Starting proliferating cancer cells located well-oxygenated regions, may express so-called "Warburg effect" aerobic glycolysis, meaning although plenty oxygen available, cancer cells choose glycolysis, sole pathway allows biomass formation DNA duplication, needed cell division. Although oxygen represent primary font energy, diffusion rate reduces oxygen tension emerging hypoxia promotes "anaerobic glycolysis" hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha-dependent up-regulation. acquired hypoxic phenotype endowed high resistance cell death high migration capacities, although cells less proliferating. Cells using aerobic anaerobic glycolysis survive case extrude acidic metabolites acidifying extracellular space. Acidosis drives cancer cells glycolysis OxPhos, OxPhos transforms available alternative substrates energy used fuel migration distant organ colonization. Thus, metabolic adaptations sustain different energy-requiring ability cancer cells, render responsive perturbations anti-metabolic agents, inhibitors glycolysis and/or OxPhos.
