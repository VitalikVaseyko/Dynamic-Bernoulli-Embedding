 dynamic functional organization fructose-6-phosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate cycle investigated open homogeneous reconstituted enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. properties system analyzed model based kinetic properties individual enzymes. could shown broad parameter region sustained oscillations arise. low maximum activities phosphofructokinase domain multiple stationary states occurs, stable stationary states coexist stable oscillatory alternate stable stationary state. occurrence oscillations emergence alternate stationary motions caused mainly reciprocal effect allosteric effectors AMP fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase must involved reaction network. study bisphosphatase. attained states either glycolytic gluconeogenic, metabolic efficiencies depend mainly maximum activities phosphofructokinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase well supply fructose-6-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Efficient metabolic states arise enzyme concentrations rates substrate supply favor either glycolytic gluconeogenic mode action. medium maximum concentrations enzymes oscillations occur, glycolytic gluconeogenic states consecutively passed. high rate substrate cycling observed transitions functionally antagonistic phases periodicities. temporal organization mean efficiency states increased. integration fructose-2,6-bisphosphate sensitively acting activator phosphofructokinase inhibitor fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gives rise either emergence oscillations extinction. Generally, glycolytic mode favored effector stimulatory action phosphofructokinase activity.
