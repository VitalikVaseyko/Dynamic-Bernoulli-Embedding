 Members protein kinase C (PKC) family implicated controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, motility. Many processes energy demanding. PKCs affect mitochondrial function regulate energy production well defined. Using inhibitor Go6983 broad specificity, found inhibiting PKCs reduced mitochondrial mass altered mitochondrial function characterized elevations mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. alterations indicated Go6983 suppressed activities mitochondrial regulators estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). Indeed, Go6983 dose-dependently suppressed expression levels ERRalpha-target genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). Conversely, PKC activator phorbol ester (PMA) enhanced expression level another ERRalpha-target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). PMA-mediated induction PDK4 blunted ERRalpha inverse agonist XCT-790, suggesting ERRalpha plays role mediating effects PKCs mitochondrial function. over-expressing constitutively active forms PKCs, found PKCepsilon preferentially stimulated transcription activity ERRalpha. mutating residues ERRalpha, established PKCepsilon-induced ERRalpha activity involves threonine 106, serine 110, threonine 124 ERRalpha. Collectively, pieces evidence suggest ERRalpha plays important role down-stream PKCepsilon regulate mitochondrial homeostasis.
