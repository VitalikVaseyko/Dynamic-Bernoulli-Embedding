 Neurone-specific enolase (NSE) brain form creatine phosphokinase (CPK-BB) previously found present rat synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) using two-dimensional gel (2-D gel) peptide analysis; enzymatic activities pyruvate kinase (PK), involved ATP generation, shown "cryptic" unless SPM treated Triton X-100. show enzymatic activation also occurs SPM treated trifluoperazine (TFP). TFP activation occurred even enzymes membrane associated, showing solubilization responsible "unmasking" enzyme activities. TFP treatment performed alkaline instead neutral pH, NSE CPK-BB released well PK, nonneuronal enolase, aldolase identified 2-D gel tryptic peptide analysis. proteins released included calmodulin, actin, 70-kilodalton heat-shock cognate protein. Tubulin, synapsin I, 35-kilodalton basic protein largely unaffected. latter identified glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase basis 2-D gel peptide analyses subsequent partial sequencing rat brain cDNA coding protein. TFP treatment thus useful activating latent enzymes well distinguishing enzymes different disposition membrane.
