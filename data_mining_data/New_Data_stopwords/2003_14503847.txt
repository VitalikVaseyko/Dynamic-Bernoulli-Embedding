 understand effects bcl-2 glucose metabolism tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mediated cytotoxicity, activities glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, pyruvate kinase), lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase examined without TNF-alpha treatment TNF-alpha sensitive L929 cells TNF-alpha resistant bcl-2 transfected L929 cells. TNF-alpha-treated L929 cells, activities glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase greatly increased, detectable change phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Pyruvate carboxylase activity decreased 25% 6 12 h TNF-alpha treatment. activities glycolytic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase bcl-2 transfected L929 cells lower L929 cells upon TNF-alpha treatment. hand, activity pyruvate carboxylase 20-100% greater 6 h TNF-alpha treatment L929 cells. activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase bcl-2 trasfected L929 cells lower 25% L929 cells 12 h. increase pyruvate carboxylase activity decrease phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity bcl-2 transfected L929 cells may contribute protective effects bcl-2 TNF-alpha mediated cytotoxicity.
