 Neurons highly vulnerable ischemic/hypoxic stress, glial cells show tolerance stress. However, mechanisms tolerance acquisition glial cells yet established. attempted isolate identify stress protein upregulated response hypoxia human astrocytoma CCF-STTG1 cells. particular, pyruvate kinase (PK) upregulated hypoxia CCF-STTG1 cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), primary transcription factor responsible multiple gene activation hypoxia, plays critical role PK expression hypoxic challenge. determine whether newly synthesized PK involved tolerance hypoxic stress, established PK-overexpressing neuronal cells. Overexpression wild-type, kinase-negative mutant, resulted attenuation loss cell viability typical apoptotic features hypoxia oxidative stress SK-N-MC cells. findings suggest upregulation PK may result acquisition tolerance hypoxic stress, antioxidant effect may involved protective effect PK.
