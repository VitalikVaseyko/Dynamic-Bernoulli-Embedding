 Transfusion-induced hemochromatosis potential therapeutic complication management sickle cell anemia. Selective transfusion young erythrocytes (neocytes), theoretically longer life-span regular donor red cells, could decrease transfusion frequency reduce iron deposition sickle cell patient. Using blood cell separators, method devised prepare neocyte units transfusion. Neocyte enrichment evaluated reticulocyte count mean red cell age estimated erythrocyte pyruvate kinase, age-dependent enzyme. neocyte units average estimated men cell age 30 days compared 60 days unfractionated units. Radiochromium studies seven splenectomized thalassemia major patients revealed average half-life 47.4 days neocytes stored frozen state compared average half-life 29.5 days standard frozen red cells. Neocyte aliquots collected three normal, eusplenic donors average estimated mean cell age 6.5 days average half-life 57.2 days reinfused. Neocyte units cost +300 collect process compared $92 frozen red cells, use neocyte units could reduce one-half transfusion requirement transfusion-dependent patients.
