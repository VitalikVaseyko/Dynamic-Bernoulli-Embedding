 Trypanosoma cruzi (epimastigotes), Crithidia fasciculata Leishmania mexicana (promastigotes) grown brain-heart-tryptose medium supplemented heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. T. cruzi C. fasciculata utilized glucose completely log phase growth, whereas L. mexicana used significant amounts carbohydrate end log phase beginning stationary phase. cases glucose consumption resulted excretion succinate, much smaller amounts acetate. C. fasciculata L. mexicana produced small amounts pyruvate. C. fasciculata produced ethanol, taken metabolysed glucose exhausted. Lactate malate produced. cells disrupted sonic disintegration, activities key enzymes carbohydrate amino acid catabolism assayed whole homogenates. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase present three organisms; L. mexicana presented highest specific activity. activity enzyme maximal glucose consumption, slightly decreased glucose exhausted. suggests role played enzyme glycolytic gluconeogenic; latter case higher organisms. Hexokinase pyruvate kinase presented highest levels C. fasciculata T. cruzi glucose consumption. L. mexicana, active glycolysis whole experimental period, presented highest specific activities enzymes. Citrate synthase, hand, increased C. fasciculata and, lesser extent, T. cruzi, glucose exhausted; enzyme could detected L. mexicana. NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase increased considerably C. fasciculata T. cruzi glucose exhausted, suggesting catabolic role enzyme. increase coincided increase NH3 production organisms glucose consumption. NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase, hand, presented maximum time glucose exhausted, decreased again, suggests catabolic role enzyme. glutamate dehydrogenases low activities L. mexicana; fits well low NH3 production throughout culture organism. results good agreement current ideas mechanism aerobic glucose fermentation trypanosomatids, suggest that, experimental conditions used, T. cruzi C. fasciculata used glucose perferentially amino acids growth.
