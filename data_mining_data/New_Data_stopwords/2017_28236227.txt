 PURPOSE: hallmark cancer metabolic reprogramming, exploited cancer cells ensure rapid growth survival. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes final step glycolysis, key step tumor metabolism growth. Recently, reported radiosynthesis first positron emission tomography tracer visualizing PKM2 vivo-i.e., [(11)C]DASA-23. Due highly promising imaging results obtained [(11)C]DASA-23 rodent model glioblastoma, set generate F-18-labeled version tracer, end goal clinical translation mind. Herein, report radiosynthesis 1-((2-fluoro-6-[(18)F]fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperaz ine ([(18)F]DASA-23) initial investigation binding properties cancer cells. PROCEDURE: synthesized [(18)F]DASA-23 via fluorination 1-((2-fluoro-6-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine (10) K[(18)F]F/K2.2.2 N,N-dimethylformamide 110 degrees C 20 min. Subsequently, evaluated uptake [(18)F]DASA-23 HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells vitro stability human mouse serum. RESULTS: successfully prepared [(18)F]DASA-23 2.61 +/- 1.54 % radiochemical yield (n = 10, non-decay corrected end synthesis) specific activity 2.59 +/- 0.44 Ci/mumol. Preliminary cell uptake experiments revealed high uptake HeLa cells, effectively blocked pretreating cells structurally distinct PKM2 activator, TEPP-46. [(18)F]DASA-23 remained intact human mouse serum 120 min. CONCLUSION: Herein, identified F-18-labeled PKM2 specific radiotracer shows potential vivo imaging. promising cell uptake results reported herein warrant evaluation [(18)F]DASA-23 ability detect monitor cancer noninvasively.
