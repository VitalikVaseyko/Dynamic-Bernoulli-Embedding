 Altered metabolism cancer first discovered Otto Warburg early last century. Although Warburg Effect widely used tumor detection, relatively little progress made mechanistic understanding cancer metabolism subsequent eight decades. Genetic studies recently identified mutations human cancer targeting multiple enzymes involved intermediate metabolism. One emerging mechanism common mutant enzymes accumulation metabolite alters epigenetic control.
