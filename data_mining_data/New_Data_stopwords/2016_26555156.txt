 Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate-like 1 (MARCKSL1) plays pivotal role regulation apoptosis shown maintain antitumor metastasis-suppressive properties. present study, examined effects MARCKSL1 novel anti-angiogenic agent inhibition angiogenesis-mediated cell migration. MARCKSL1 also reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, well capillary-like tubular structure formation vitro. MARCKSL1 disrupted phosphorylation vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) ovarian tumorigenesis. addition, MARCKSL1 showed potent anti-angiogenic activity reduced levels VEGF hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression, essential regulator angiogenesis. Consistently, MARCKSL1 decreased VEGFinduced phosphorylation PI3K/Akt signaling pathway components, including phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1), mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC-2), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) protein. Collectively, results provide evidence physiological/biological function endothelial cell system involved angiogenesis suppression Akt/PDK-1/mTOR phosphorylation interaction VEGFR-2.
