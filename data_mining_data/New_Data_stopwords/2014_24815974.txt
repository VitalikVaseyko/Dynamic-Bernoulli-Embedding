 formerly introduced theoretical R values [Henn & Schonleber (2013). Acta Cryst. A69, 549-558] used develop relative indicator systematic errors model refinements, R(meta), applied published charge-density data. counter R(meta) gives absolute measure systematic errors percentage points. residuals (Io - Ic)/sigma(Io) published data examined. found published models correspond residual distributions consistent assumption Gaussian distribution. consistency Gaussian distribution, however, important, model parameter estimates standard uncertainties least-squares procedure valid assumption. effect correlations introduced structure model briefly discussed help artificial data discarded source serious correlations examined example. Intensity significance cutoffs applied refinement procedure found mechanisms preventing residual distributions becoming Gaussian. Model refinements artificial data yield zero close-to-zero values R(meta) data truncated small negative values case application moderate cutoff Io > 0. well known literature application cutoff values leads model bias [Hirshfeld & Rabinovich (1973). Acta Cryst. A29, 510-513].
