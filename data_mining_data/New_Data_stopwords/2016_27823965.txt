 Radiotherapy widely used part multidisciplinary treatment approaches advanced laryngeal carcinoma preservation laryngeal function. However, mechanism radioresistance still unclear. studies revealed Warburg effect promotes radioresistance various malignant tumors, including laryngeal carcinoma. Among regulators involved Warburg effect, hexokinase-II (HK-II) crucial glycolytic enzyme catalyzes first essential step glucose metabolism. HK-II reportedly highly expressed human solid carcinomas many studies. laryngeal carcinoma, one. Till now, studies directly targeted inhibited HK-II enhanced radiosensitivity laryngeal carcinoma. Accumulating evidence shown dysregulated signaling pathways often result HK-II overexpression. Here, summarize recent advances understanding association among Warburg effect, HK-II, radioresistance laryngeal carcinoma. speculate feasibility enhancing radiosensitivity targeted inhibiting HK-II signaling pathways laryngeal carcinoma, may provide novel anticancer therapy.
