 purpose study investigate whether intensive insulin treatment dogs suffering type 1 diabetes mellitus, resulting tight glycemic control, could reflected changes peripheral leukocyte metabolism. Specifically, plasma metabolites enzyme activities assessed. addition, quantitative RT-PCR used determine changes insulin signaling gene (insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) P85alpha) mRNA levels peripheral leukocytes. Lastly, leukocyte enzymes involved cellular energy metabolism examined changes glucose utilization. results indicated intensive insulin treatment successful type 1 DM dogs, leading tight glycemic control. mean glucose concentration glycated albumin percentage significantly decreased 156 mg/dl 15.6%, respectively, following treatment. peripheral leukocytes, IRS-2 PI3-K p85alpha mRNA levels significantly increased, significant increase pyruvate kinase pyruvate carboxylase activity, two enzymes involved cellular energy metabolism, also observed post treatment. Therefore, observed changes insulin signaling pathway activity cellular energy metabolism enzyme activity peripheral leukocytes considered characteristics amelioration glucose metabolism insulin action. such, peripheral leukocytes sufficiently sensitive monitor improving glycemic control intensive insulin treatment type 1 DM dogs. Blood cells leukocytes much readily available muscle adipose tissue studies dogs.
