 Mutations PKLR gene responsible pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient anaemia mainly located coding regions: 11 splicing sites and, recently, three mutations described promoter region. report novel point mutation A-->G nucleotide 72, upstream initiation codon PKLR gene, four Portuguese PK-deficient patients. new regulatory mutation occurs within proximal four GATA motifs (GATA-A element) R-type promoter region. two patients homozygous mutation, semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure used evaluate amount R-PK mRNA transcript reticulocytes. mRNA level five times lower normal controls, demonstrating PKLR gene transcription severely affected, probably -72A-->G point mutation disables binding erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 GATA-A element. Supporting data, two patients homozygous -72A-->G mutation severe haemolytic anaemia transfusion dependent splenectomy. Two patients compound heterozygous mutation previously described missense mutation 1456C-->T mild condition.
