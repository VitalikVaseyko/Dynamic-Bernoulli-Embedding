 Mammalian hibernation requires specific regulatory controls metabolism coordinate entry, maintenance, arousal stages, well adjustments many metabolic functions support long-term dormancy. Several mechanisms metabolic regulation involved potentiating survival. One reversible phosphorylation regulatory enzymes, including glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase. particular, sharp suppression pyruvate dehydrogenase hibernation shows importance control mitochondrial oxidative metabolism reducing metabolic rate. Fine control specific enzymes also occurs via differential temperature effects kinetic allosteric properties. Analysis temperature effects properties pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, creatine kinase, citrate synthase ground squirrel bat tissues shows range responses, would reduce enzyme activity hibernating state would promote temperature-insensitive enzyme function. Reduced tissue phosphagen adenylate levels, energy charge, may also contribute overall metabolic suppression. New research exploring role transcriptional translational controls hibernation via several approaches. example, immunoblotting antibodies heat shock proteins (hsp 70 family) revealed presence constitutive hsc 70 bat tissues levels protein change euthermic hibernating states neither inducible hsp 70 glucose-responsive protein grp 78 appeared hibernation.
