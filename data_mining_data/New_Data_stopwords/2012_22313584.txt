 BACKGROUND: Results different trails provided evidence protective effects cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) cardiovascular diseases. inhibition prolyl hydroxylase 1 (PHD1) associated induction hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) CLA protective effects never reported before. objective study evaluate two predominant cis-9,trans-11 (c9, t11), trans-10,cis-12 (t10, c12) CLA isomers mixture two isomers inhibit PHD1 induction HIFs myocardium mice subsequent effects myocardium metabolism. RESULTS: CLA mixture c9, t11 CLA inhibited PHD1 protein expression increased levels protein mRNA HIF-2alpha myocardium mice. Meanwhile, CLA mixture c9, t11 CLA also elevated expression HIF related transcriptional factors like PDK4 PPARalpha. reprogramming basal metabolism myocardium mice shown increasing GLUT4 gene expression c9, t11 CLA supplemented group. UCP2 increased CLA mixture c9, t11 CLA attenuating production ROS. CONCLUSION: CLA mixture c9, t11 CLA could inhibit PHD1 induce HIF-2alpha myocardium mice, associated upregulation PDK4 activation PPARalpha. process also implies reprogramming basal metabolism oxidative damage protection myocardium mice. effects shown hearts mice due c9, t11 CLA t10, c12 CLA.
