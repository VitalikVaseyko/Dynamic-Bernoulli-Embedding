 present review discusses recent work melatonin-mediated circadian regulation, metabolic molecular signaling mechanisms involved human breast cancer growth, associated consequences circadian disruption exposure light night (LEN). anti-cancer actions circadian melatonin signal human breast cancer cell lines xenografts heavily involve MT1 receptor-mediated mechanisms. estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive human breast cancer, melatonin suppresses ERalpha mRNA expression ERalpha transcriptional activity via MT1 receptor. Melatonin also regulates transactivation members nuclear receptor superfamily, estrogen-metabolizing enzymes, expression core clock clock-related genes. Furthermore, melatonin also suppresses tumor aerobic metabolism (the Warburg effect) and, subsequently, cell-signaling pathways critical cell proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, drug resistance. Melatonin demonstrates cytostatic cytotoxic activity breast cancer cells appears cell type-specific. Melatonin also possesses anti-invasive/anti-metastatic actions involve multiple pathways, including inhibition p38 MAPK repression epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Studies demonstrated melatonin promotes genomic stability inhibiting expression LINE-1 retrotransposons. Finally, research animal human models indicated LEN-induced disruption circadian nocturnal melatonin signal promotes growth, metabolism, signaling human breast cancer drives breast tumors endocrine chemotherapeutic resistance. data provide strongest understanding support mechanisms underpin epidemiologic demonstration elevated breast cancer risk night-shift workers individuals increasingly exposed LEN.
