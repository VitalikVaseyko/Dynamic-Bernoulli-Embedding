 Recent treatment patients thalassemia chronic anemia involves transfusion young red cells (YRBCs) "neocytes." developed technique enabling YRBCs separated based buoyant density autologous plasma centrifugation. Following procedure, measurement pyruvate kinase (PK), age-dependent red cell enzyme, showed neocyte enrichment top one-third RBC layer corresponding mean 47.5 percent total PK present unfractionated unit. provide neocyte transfusion preparation acceptable hemoglobin content, top one-third fraction three bags blood pooled. Leukocytes removed "neocyte unit" initial sedimentation 6 percent hydroxyethyl starch (HES) followed filtration filter (IG 500, Imugard). process resulted removal 99.3 +/- 0.5 percent (mean +/- SD) leukocytes mean RBC recovery 89.5 +/- 5.5 percent final hemoglobin content 53.4 +/- 2.3 g. Tests plasma-free hemoglobin HES supernatant final transfusion product gave acceptable mean values 28 mg per dl 3.0 mg per ml. Autologous mean RBC survival Cr51-labeled YRBC fractions 41.8 +/- 2.9 days (n = 5). technique yields neocyte enrichment superior achieved using cell processor (model 2991, IBM) added advantage less costly prepare ($45.00 [1984] U.S. per YRBC unit compared estimated $135.00 [1984] U.S., IBM) economical terms blood use.
