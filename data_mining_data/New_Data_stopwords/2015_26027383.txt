 catalytic kinetic properties pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) isolated heart skeletal muscles rabbits hares 9-16-fold purification studied. initial specific activity enzyme hare heart homogenates 66% skeletal muscles 25% high respective rabbit tissues. Temperature optimums thermostability PK hare tissues higher compared rabbits. comparison K(M) (S0.5) values follows hare skeletal muscle PK exhibits highest affinity phosphoenol pyruvate, lowest ADP, compared rabbit skeletal muscle PK. Moreover, PK hare tissues exhibits positive kinetic cooperativity (Hill coefficient > 1.35) phosphoenol pyruvate ADP binding sites. contrast PK rabbit tissues, enzyme hare heart muscles PK presented allosteric isoform might advantageous extreme conditions hare's habitation.
