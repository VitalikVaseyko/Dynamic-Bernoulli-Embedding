 Carrell Lehmann reported method precipitating Hb attractive terms rapidity, simplicity, reversibility, lack rigorous conditions. applied methodology concentration partial purification certain red cell enzyme activities. Twenty-three glycolytic nonglycolytic enzymes studied (Table 1). conditions 97% 98% Hb precipitated, recoveries supernatant 14 enzymes ranged 40% 100%, nine activities virtually completely recovered measured routine assay. six instances, minimal activity recoverable either supernatant precipitate. case enzymes whose recovered activities supernatant large, rigorous investigation detect possible zinc-induced alterations necessary determine whether procedure impairs parameters readily evaluated routine assay. effect procedure PK studied intensively. kinetics enzyme PEP ADP unaffected, thermostability appeared differ native PK, ATP inhibition activity normal. Addition zinc supernatant precipitated PK, could partially purified (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Inclusion magnesium substrate PEP hemolysate prior zinc addition increased recovery supernatant 40% 80%.
