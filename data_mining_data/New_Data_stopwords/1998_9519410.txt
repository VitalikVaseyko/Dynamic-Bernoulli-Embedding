 BACKGROUND: Yeast pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes final step glycolysis. enzyme therefore represents important control point allosterically activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). mammals enzyme found four different isozymes different regulatory properties: two isozymes produced alternate splicing. allosteric regulation PK directly related proliferation certain cell types, demonstrated expression allosterically regulated isozyme tumor cells. model allosteric transition inactive (T) state active (R) state proposed previously, FBP-binding site identified. RESULTS: report structures PK yeast complexed substrate analog catalytic metal ions presence absence bound FBP. allosteric site located 40 active site entirely located enzyme regulatory (C) domain. phosphate-binding site allosteric activator created residues encoded region gene corresponding alternately spliced exon mammalian isozymes. FBP activation appears induce several conformational changes among active-site sidechains mechanism likely involve significant domain motions, previously hypothesized. CONCLUSIONS: structure location allosteric activator site agrees pattern alternate genetic splicing PK gene multicellular eukaryotes distinguishes non-regulated isozyme regulated fetal isozymes. conformational differences observed active sites inactive fully active PK enzymes agreement recently determined thermodynamic mechanism allosteric activation 'metal relay' increases affinity enzyme natural phosphoenolpyruvate substrate.
