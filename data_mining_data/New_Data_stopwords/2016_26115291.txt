 objective study determine impact stocker production systems differing growth rate rumen fermentation characteristics utilization substrates fatty acid synthesis intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), perirenal (PR) adipose tissues. Angus steers assigned 4 stocker cattle production systems 2 consecutive years: 1) 1.0 kg/d 40% CP cottonseed meal-based supplement grazing dormant native range (CON), 2) ground corn/soybean meal-based supplement grazing dormant native range fed 1% BW (CORN), 3) grazing wheat pasture high stocking rate achieve low rate BW gain (LGWP), 4) grazing wheat pasture low stocking rate high rate BW gain (HGWP). Eight ruminally cannulated steers used determine rumen fermentation characteristics. Steers harvested stocker phase similar age (different carcass weight) Exp. 1 (3 steers/treatment) similar carcass weight Exp. 2 (4 steers/treatment). Adipose tissues analyzed mRNA expression genes involved glucose (solute carrier family 2, member 4 [GLUT4], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PDH], phosphofructokinase, muscle [PFKM], pyruvate kinase 2, muscle [PK2]), lactate (lactate dehydrogenase B [LDHB]), acetate (acetyl-CoA synthetase, cytosol [ACSS2]) utilization fatty acid synthesis. acetate:propionate ratio least (P < 0.05) HGWP steers, intermediate CORN LGWP steers, greatest CON steers. similar age, LGWP HGWP steers tended (F-test; P < 0.15) greater (P < 0.10) G6PDH ACSS2 mRNA expression CON CORN steers SC PR IM adipose tissue. Expression PFKM PK2 mRNA tended (F-test; P < 0.15) greater (P < 0.10) HGWP CON LGWP steers IM SC PR adipose tissue. similar HCW, expression GLUT4 G6PDH mRNA greater (P < 0.10) SC adipose tissue LGWP HGWP steers compared CON CORN steers IM PR adipose tissue. Expression LDHB mRNA lesser (P < 0.10) SC adipose tissue greater (P < 0.10) PR adipose tissue LGWP HGWP steers compared CON CORN steers. results indicate shift toward glucose utilization SC adipose tissue shift towards lactate utilization PR adipose tissue. results suggest diet changes VFA profile influence substrates utilized fatty acid synthesis, diet greater effect SC IM adipose tissue.
