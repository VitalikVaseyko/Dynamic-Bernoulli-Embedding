 OBJECTIVE: study mechanism controls fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) accumulation, well mRNAs levels glycolytic/gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes livers fed starved lean (fa/-) obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats. DESIGN: Rats fed standard chow deprived food 24 h. SUBJECTS: Male lean (fa/-) genetically obese (fa/fa) rats (nine weeks old). MEASUREMENTS: Fru-2,6-P2 concentration, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2), glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK) activities mRNA levels GK, PFK-2, L-type pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) analyzed. RESULTS: PFK-2/FBPase-2 mRNA decreased starvation fa/- fa/fa animals. Although PFK-2/FBPase-2 mRNA levels similar fed lean obese rats, PFK-2 concentration activity higher fed obese fed lean animals, might explain high concentration Fru-2,6-P2 observed obese animals. starvation, PFK-2 protein concentration decreased, correlating enzymatic activity Fru-2,6-P2 levels. activities GK L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) also increased fed obese (fa/fa) rats compared fed lean (fa/-) animals, decreased starvation. mRNA levels glycolytic enzymes fed obese rats similar (PFK-2) higher (GK, L-PK) fed lean animals. starvation, decreased lean obese rats one important exception, GK mRNA remained high obese animals. mRNA gluconeogenic enzymes remained constant (FBPase-1) increased (PEPCK) fasting. CONCLUSION: changes observed might explained hyperinsulinaemia observed liver obese rats, might lead stimulation glycolysis lipogenesis.
