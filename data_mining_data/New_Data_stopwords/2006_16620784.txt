 Ninety-eight genes/ESTs differential expressions epididymal adipose tissue fed 3-day fasting (F3) rats identified microarray analysis. Genes lipogenesis, glycolysis, glucose aerobic oxidation decreased response starvation. study performed investigate expression patterns genes rat tissues short- long-term starvations. results increased expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) rat muscle together decreased fatty acid synthase (FAS) rat adipose tissue 1 day fasting (F1) suggested transcriptional level glucose aerobic oxidation down-regulated rat muscle synthesis saturated fatty acids inhibited rat adipose tissue short-term fasting. noted transcriptions genes involved fatty acid oxidation, very-long-chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAH), Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CAT)L, greatly increased F1 rat liver, began decrease F3 5-day fasting (F5) rat liver, combined significantly increased serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) F1 rats increased urea F5 rats, suggesting inhibition oxidation lipid decreased availability fuels may play important role phase II-phase III fasting transition long-term fasting rats.
