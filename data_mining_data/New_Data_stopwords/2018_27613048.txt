 polypeptide chain interact polypeptide chains form stable functional complexes called "oligomers." Frequently, biochemical analysis complexes made difficult great size. Traditionally, size exclusion chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation techniques used isolate oligomers. Components oligomers separated sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified immunoblotting specific antibodies. Although sensitive, techniques easy perform reproduce. use Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis allows simultaneous analysis proteins mass range 10-500 kDa. used characteristic together cross-linking reagents analyze oligomerization endogenous proteins single electrophoretic gel. demonstrate oligomerization p53, pyruvate kinase isoform M2, heat shock protein 27 studied system. also show system useful studying oligomerization large proteins clathrin heavy chain tuberous sclerosis complex. Oligomerization analysis dependent cross-linker used concentration. features make system helpful tool analysis protein oligomerization.
