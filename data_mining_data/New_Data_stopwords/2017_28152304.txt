 PDK1 essential cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation NF-kappaB, PDK1-induced phosphorylation PKCtheta important TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, inverse regulation PDK1 PKCtheta cell activation investigated. study, found PKCtheta involved human PDK1 phosphorylation kinase activity crucial human PDK1 phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry analysis wild-type PKCtheta kinase-inactive form PKCtheta revealed PKCtheta induced phosphorylation human PDK1 Ser-64. PKCtheta-induced PDK1 phosphorylation positively regulated cell activation TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, phosphorylation human PDK1 Ser-64 increased stability human PDK1 protein. results suggest Ser-64 important phosphorylation site part positive feedback loop human PDK1-PKCtheta-mediated cell activation.
