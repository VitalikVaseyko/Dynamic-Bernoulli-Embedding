 Comparative genomic analysis wild-type strain ovine pathogen Chlamydia abortus nitrosoguanidine-induced, temperature-sensitive, virulence-attenuated live vaccine derivative identified 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms unique mutant, including nine nonsynonymous mutations, one leading truncation pmpG, encodes polymorphic membrane protein, two intergenic mutations potentially affecting promoter sequences. nonsynonymous mutations mapped pmpG pseudogene predicted coding sequences encoding putative lipoprotein, sigma-54-dependent response regulator, PhoH-like protein, putative export protein, two tRNA synthetases, putative serine hydroxymethyltransferase. One intergenic mutations putatively affects transcription two divergent genes encoding pyruvate kinase putative SOS response nuclease, respectively. observations suggest temperature-sensitive phenotype associated virulence attenuation vaccine strain result disrupted metabolic activity due altered pyruvate kinase expression and/or alteration function one membrane proteins, notably PmpG putative lipoprotein.
