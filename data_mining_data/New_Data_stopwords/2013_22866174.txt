 Sulindac FDA-approved non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug documented anticancer activities. recent studies showed sulindac selectively enhanced killing cancer cells exposed oxidizing agents via production reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting mitochondrial dysfunction. effect sulindac oxidative stress cancer cells could related defect respiration cancer cells, first described Warburg 50 years ago, known Warburg effect. postulated sulindac might enhance selective killing cancer cells combined compound alters mitochondrial respiration. test hypothesis used dichloroacetate (DCA), known shift pyruvate metabolism away lactic acid formation respiration. One might expect DCA, since stimulates aerobic metabolism, could stress mitochondrial respiration cancer cells, would result enhanced killing presence sulindac. study, shown combination sulindac DCA enhances selective killing A549 SCC25 cancer cells conditions used. predicted, mechanism killing involves ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, JNK signaling death apoptosis. results suggest sulindac-DCA drug combination may provide effective cancer therapy.
