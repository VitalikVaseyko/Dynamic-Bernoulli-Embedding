 Relative levels many individual proteins Escherichia coli HB101 strains 0, 37, 56, 240 plasmids per chromosome determined computer image analysis two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns. plasmids investigated similar sequences except small domains encoding repressor plasmid replication. intermediate plasmid copy number 56, levels several TCA cycle enzymes (oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, succinate thiokinase, succinate dehydrogenase) well aspartate transcarbamoylase increased. plasmid copy number 240, higher amounts PEP carboxylase well several heat shock proteins observed. Furthermore, high plasmid levels, significant decreases occurred growth rate, pyruvate kinase I, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, unadenylated glutamine synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase well several proteins involved translation. Decreases ribosome content well free 30S 50S ribosomal subunit pool fractions also observed separate analyses. results indicate recombinant DNA manipulations cause major alterations numerous host cell properties could significantly influence cloned protein production metabolic engineering endeavors.
