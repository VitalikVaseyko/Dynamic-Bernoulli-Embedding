 down-regulation cellular depletion protein kinase C (PKC) attendant prolonged activation phorbol esters widely described property key family signaling enzymes. However, neither mechanism down-regulation whether mechanism occurs following stimulation physiological agonists known. show peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 provides timer lifetime conventional PKC isozymes, converting enzymes species dephosphorylated ubiquitinated following activation induced either phorbol esters natural agonists. regulation Pin1 requires catalytic activity isomerase presence Pro immediately following phosphorylated Thr turn motif phosphorylation site, one two C-terminal sites phosphorylated maturation PKC isozymes. Furthermore, second C-terminal phosphorylation site, hydrophobic motif, docks Pin1 PKC. data consistent model Pin1 binds hydrophobic motif conventional PKC isozymes catalyze isomerization phospho-Thr-Pro peptide bond turn motif, thus converting PKC isozymes species efficiently down-regulated following activation.
