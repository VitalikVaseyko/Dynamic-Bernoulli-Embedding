 Transcription genes encoding enzymes required lipogenesis induced hepatocytes response elevated glucose metabolism. previously mapped carbohydrate-response elements (ChoREs) rat liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) S(14) genes found share significant sequence similarity. However, progress unraveling signaling pathway hampered due difficulty identifying key factor(s) bind ChoREs. gain insight nature carbohydrate-responsive transcription factor, glucose regulatory sequences mouse S(14) gene examined primary hepatocytes. Three elements found essential supporting glucose response: thyroid hormone-response element -1522 -1494, accessory factor site -1421 -1392, ChoRE -1450 -1425. these, accessory factor site conserved rat mouse S(14) genes. Investigation ChoRE sequence indicated two half E box motifs critical response glucose. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed complex formed mouse S(14) ChoRE liver nuclear proteins. complex also formed ChoREs rat S(14) L-PK genes mutants sites inactive supporting glucose response. results suggest presence novel transcription factor complex mediates glucose-regulated transcription S(14) L-PK genes.
