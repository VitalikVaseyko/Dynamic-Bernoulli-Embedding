 Increased O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) associated insulin resistance muscle adipocytes. Upon insulin treatment insulin-responsive adipocytes, O-GlcNAcylation several proteins increased. Key insulin signaling proteins, including IRS-1, IRS-2, PDK1, substrates OGT, suggesting potential O-GlcNAc control points within pathway. elucidate roles O-GlcNAc dampening insulin signaling (Vosseller, K., Wells, L., Lane, M. D., Hart, G. W. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 5313-5318), focused pathway upstream AKT. Increasing O-GlcNAc 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreases phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) interactions IRS-1 IRS-2. Elevated O-GlcNAc also reduces phosphorylation PI3K p85 binding motifs (YXXM) IRS-1 results concomitant reduction tyrosine phosphorylation Y(608)XXM IRS-1, one two main PI3K p85 binding motifs. Additionally, insulin signaling stimulates interaction OGT PDK1. conclude one steps O-GlcNAc contributes insulin resistance inhibiting phosphorylation Y(608)XXM PI3K p85 binding motif IRS-1 possibly PDK1 well.
