 activity enzymes central metabolic pathways subject intensive analysis; however, Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway recently begun attract attention. metabolic response edd gene knockout Escherichia coli JM101 PTS- Glc+ investigated gluconate glucose batch cultures compared pyruvate kinase PTS mutants previously constructed. Even though specific growth rates strain carrying edd gene knockout parent JM101 PTS- Glc+ edd parent PTS- Glc+ similar, reproducible changes specific consumption rates biomass yields obtained grown glucose. results support participation ED pathway gluconate metabolism metabolic biochemical processes E. coli. Despite gluconate non-PTS carbohydrate, PTS- Glc+ derived strains showed important reductions specific growth gluconate consumption rates. Moreover, overall activity ED pathway gluconate resulted important increments PTS- Glc+ PTS- Glc+ pykF mutants. Additional results obtained pykA pykF mutant indicate important contribution pyruvate kinase enzymes pyruvate synthesis energy production carbon sources.
