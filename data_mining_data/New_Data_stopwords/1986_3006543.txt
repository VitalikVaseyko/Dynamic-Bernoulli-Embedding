 Half-site editing vitro mutagenesis procedure designed use making precise plasmid constructions. Like many vitro mutagenesis techniques, procedure involves hybridization mutagenic oligonucleotide primer single-stranded template DNA followed polymerization DNA polymerase (Klenow). Half-site editing differs techniques two main ways. First, T4 DNA polymerase treatment truncates target DNA point determined primer repairs mismatches sequence specified primer. Second, blunt-end ligation step included. ligation exploits symmetry inherent restriction sites create desired restriction site truncated end target DNA fragment. Half-site editing used place ClaI restriction sites 3' end yeast pyruvate kinase promoter two positions 5' end yeast acetolactate synthase coding sequence.
