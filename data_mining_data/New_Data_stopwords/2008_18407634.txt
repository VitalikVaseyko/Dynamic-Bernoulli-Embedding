 19F NMR-based methods found utility activity-based screening assays. However, enzymes catalyze diverse set reactions, large variety fluorinated substrates would need identified target one separately. developed streamlined approach applicable many enzymes utilize ATP substrate. method, fluorine-containing ATP analogue, 2-fluoro-ATP, used monitor reaction. Applications described nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1. Fragment screening results latter indicate technique identify compounds inhibit well activate reactions. present results, together previous biochemical studies laboratories, shown 2-fluoro-ATP serve substrate nine enzymes representative three six enzyme subclasses, namely transferases, hydrolases, ligases. suggests 2-fluoro-ATP suitable universal tool screening ATP-requiring enzymes. Importantly, 2-fluoro-ATP determined valid substrate variety kinases, including small molecule protein kinases, suggesting may useful investigating large number pharmaceutically relevant kinases.
