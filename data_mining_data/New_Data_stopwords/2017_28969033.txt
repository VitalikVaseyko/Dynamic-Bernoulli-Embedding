 BACKGROUND: Discrimination benign malignant tumors challenging process pediatric adrenocortical tumors. New insights metabolic profile pediatric adrenocortical tumors may contribute distinction, predict prognosis, well identify new molecular targets therapy. aim work characterize expression metabolism-related proteins MCT1, MCT2, MCT4, CD147, CD44, GLUT1 CAIX series pediatric adrenocortical tumors. METHODS: total 50 pediatric patients presenting adrenocortical tumors, including 41 clinically benign 9 clinically malignant tumors, included. Protein expression evaluated using immunohistochemistry samples arranged tissue microarrays. RESULTS: immunohistochemical analysis showed significant increase plasma membrane expression GLUT1 malignant lesions, compared benign lesions (p=0.004), expression protein associated shorter overall disease-free survival (p=0.004 p=0.001, respectively). Although significant differences observed proteins GLUT1, MCT1, MCT4 CD147 highly expressed pediatric adrenocortical neoplasias (around 90%). CONCLUSION: GLUT1 expression differentially expressed pediatric adrenocortical tumors, higher expression clinically malignant tumors, associated shorter survival, suggesting metabolic remodeling towards hyperglycolytic phenotype malignancy.
