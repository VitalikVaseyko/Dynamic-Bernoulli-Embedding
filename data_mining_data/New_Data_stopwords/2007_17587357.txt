 M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) specially expressed tumour cells (Tu M2-PK) detected peripheral blood patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC). analysed benefit using Tu M2-PK tumour marker primary detection RCC receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. area curve 0.674, sensitivity, specificity positive predictive value (PPV) 44.4%, 87.5% 88%, respectively, ROC optimal cut-off 28.2 kU/L. examined 71 patients. Since marker sensitivity detection early stages T1 T2 47% suggested use marker primary diagnosis RCC. use part confirmatory preoperative evaluation might considered view high PPV.
