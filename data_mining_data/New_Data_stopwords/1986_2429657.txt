 using [32P]-labeled phosphoaminoacids shown that, mu molar range concentrations, Tyr-32P neither Ser-32P Thr-32P significantly dephosphorylated highly purified repressible acid phosphatase Saccharomyces cerevisiae. phosphopeptide Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala however, reproducing phosphorylation site pyruvate kinase previously phosphorylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase, readily dephosphorylated favourable kinetic constants (Km 0.28 microM, Vmax = 62 units/micrograms) derivatives Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala, Arg-Arg-Ala-Thr(32P)-Val-Ala, Arg-Arg-Pro-Ser(32P)-Pro-Ala well peptides protein substrates phosphorylated either protein kinase-C casein kinase-2 either unaffected slowly dephosphorylated phosphatase. Conversely Tyr-32P containing angiotensin, poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 phosphopeptide Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr(32P)-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly dephosphorylated kinetic constants comparable free phosphotyrosine (Km 0.2-1 microM; Vmax = 4-10 units/micrograms). proposed that, acid phosphatase exhibits broad specificity toward phosphotyrosine phosphotyrosyl polypeptides, highly selective toward phosphoseryl sites fulfilling definite structural requirements reminiscent determining phosphorylation cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
