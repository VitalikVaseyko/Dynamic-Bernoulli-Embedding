 Fatty acid (FA) oversupply skeletal muscle related metabolic disorders associated obesity, also normal physiological responses. studied, vivo vitro, chronological response physiological increases FA, analyzing expression selected genes important glucose/lipid metabolism. vivo sequential model fasting (known increase circulating FA) refeeding used male Wistar rats study soleus (more oxidative) gastrocnemius (more glycolytic) muscles, chronological study made C2C12 muscle cells treatment oleic/linoleic FA mixture, physiological concentration. Body weight, muscle glycogen blood parameters (glucose, insulin, free fatty acids -FFA-, triglycerides) monitored. mRNA levels muscle carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (mCPT1), GLUT 4, insulin receptor (InsR), MyoD1, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) beta (PGC1beta), PPARalpha, PPARdelta, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) uncoupling proteins (UCPs) 2 3 analyzed quantitative RT-PCR. main results quick induction PGC1alpha, UCP3 PDK4 vivo (more marked gastrocnemius) PGC1alpha, PGC1beta, InsR, PDK4, UCP2 UCP3 vitro. concluded FA able rapidly induce expression muscle cells key genes involved catabolism oleic/linoleic acid mixture positive role increasing expression master metabolic regulators downstream target genes, facilitating transition glycolytic lipid-oxidative metabolism.
