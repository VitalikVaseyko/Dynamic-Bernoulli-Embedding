 Light controls pineal melatonin production temporally coordinates circadian rhythms metabolism physiology normal neoplastic tissues. previously showed peak circulating nocturnal melatonin levels 7-fold higher daytime spectral transmittance white light blue-tinted (compared clear) rodent cages. Here, tested hypothesis daytime blue-light amplification nocturnal melatonin enhances inhibition metabolism, signaling activity, growth prostate cancer xenografts. Compared male nude rats housed clear cages 12:12-h light:dark cycle, rats blue-tinted cages (with increased transmittance 462-484 nm decreased red light greater 640 nm) evinced 6-fold higher peak plasma melatonin levels middark phase (time, 2400), whereas midlight-phase levels (1200) low (less 3 pg/mL) groups. Circadian rhythms arterial plasma levels linoleic acid, glucose, lactic acid, pO2, pCO2, insulin, leptin, corticosterone disrupted rats blue cages compared corresponding entrained rhythms clear-caged rats. implantation tissue-isolated PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts, tumor latency-to-onset growth growth rates markedly delayed, tumor cAMP levels, uptake-metabolism linoleic acid, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), growth signaling activities reduced rats blue compared clear cages. data show amplification nighttime melatonin levels exposing nude rats blue light daytime significantly reduces human prostate cancer metabolic, signaling, proliferative activities.
