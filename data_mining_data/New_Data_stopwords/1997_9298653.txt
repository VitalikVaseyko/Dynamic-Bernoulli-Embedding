 Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) become method choice efficient separation complex protein mixtures. Previously, analysis Spiroplasma melliferum proteome (protein complement genome) performed pH 3-10 narrow range pH 4-7 IPG gel strips. report use novel 18 cm basic (pH 6-11) immobilised pH gradients (IPG) increase resolution protein spots visible within 2-D gels. gradients synthesised emulate gradient commercially available IPG gel strips 5 cm region overlap attempt construction complete map cellular protein expression. Approximately 50 additional gene products detected S. melliferum previously well-resolved visible using wide-range pH 3-10 IPG gel strips. Twenty-seven electrotransferred polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane analysed N-terminal protein microsequencing. Protein spots initial peak yield little 100 femtomoles (fm) sequenced 5-10 amino acid residues, demonstrating importance improved sample handling procedures analytical technologies. Many essential metabolic enzymes shown basic pI, including: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, carbamate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. basic protein (pI approximately 11.0) identified uridylate kinase, enzyme indirectly associated pyrimidine biosynthesis thought absent members bacterial class Mollicutes. advent novel basic (pH 6-11) IPGs allowed visualisation significantly greater percentage 'functional proteome', portion total protein complement genome actively translated within specific time frame, 2-D electrophoresis gels. aid characterisation translated gene products conjunction genome sequencing initiatives.
