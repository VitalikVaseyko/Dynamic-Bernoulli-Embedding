 BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum, causative agent serious form malaria, infects 5-10% world human population per year. well established erythrocytic stages malaria parasite rely mainly glycolysis energy supply. present study, glucose utilisation erythrocyte population parasitaemia levels similar malaria patients measured. results allowed us assess effect parasites glucose utilisation vast majority uninfected erythrocytes. METHODS: Using [2-13C]glucose nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, glucose utilisation normal red blood cell (RBC) P. falciparum infected red blood cell (IRBC) populations measured. IRBC population consisted > 96% RBC < 4% parasite infected red blood cells (PRBC). glycolytic enzymes assayed assess effect infected red cells enzymatic activities uninfected ones. RESULTS: rate glucose utilisation IRBC considerably higher RBC. Upon addition 25% v/v conditioned culture medium (CM) IRBC, RBCs exhibited significant decrease glucose utilisation. CM could directly inhibit activities RBC glycolytic enzymes-phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), without interfering activity pentose phosphate pathway enzyme-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: present study showed clinical level P. falciparum infected RBCs (< 4% parasitaemia) significantly enhance glycolytic flux well down-regulate glucose utilisation rate majority uninfected RBC population. mechanism inhibition seems direct inhibition regulatory glycolytic enzymes-PFK PK.
