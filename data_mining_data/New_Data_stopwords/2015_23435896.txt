 Cofactor specificities glycolytic enzymes Clostridium thermocellum studied cellobiose-grown cells batch cultures. Intracellular glucose phosphorylated glucokinase using GTP rather ATP. Although phosphofructokinase typically uses ATP phosphoryl donor, found pyrophosphate (PPi)-linked activity. Phosphoglycerate kinase used GDP ADP phosphoryl acceptors. agreement absence pyruvate kinase sequence C. thermocellum genome, activity enzyme could detected. Also, annotated pyruvate phosphate dikinase (ppdk) crucial generation pyruvate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), deletion ppdk gene substantially change cellobiose fermentation. Instead pyruvate formation likely proceed via malate shunt GDP-linked PEP carboxykinase, NADH-linked malate dehydrogenase, NADP-linked malic enzyme. High activities enzymes detected extracts cellobiose-grown cells. results thus show GTP consumed GTP ATP produced glycolysis C. thermocellum. requirement PPi pathway satisfied small extent biosynthetic reactions, contrast generally assumed PPi-dependent glycolysis anaerobic heterotrophs. Metabolic network analysis showed required PPi must generated via ATP GTP hydrolysis exclusive happens biosynthesis. Experimental proof necessity alternative mechanism PPi generation obtained studying glycolysis washed-cell suspensions biosynthesis absent. conditions, cells still fermented cellobiose ethanol.
