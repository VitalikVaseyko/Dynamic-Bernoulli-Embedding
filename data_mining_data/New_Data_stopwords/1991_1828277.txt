 Glycolysis important energy productive system. Enzyme abnormalities glycolytic pathway, cause myoglobinuria, deficiencies phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Common symptoms enzyme abnormalities muscle cramp, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis strenuous exercise. Acute renal failure owing myoglobinuria noteworthy symptom. daily life, symptoms rarely observed prognosis usually good. Correct fast diagnosis latent symptomatic disorders important prevent turn worse symptoms. LDH subunit deficiency first discovered urinary discoloration discrepancy laboratory data. Since then, four cases reported Japanese population. response ischemic forearm work characteristic (an increase venous lactate concentration ischemic work observed marked increase venous pyruvate found). increase pyruvate concentration specific LDH-M subunit deficiency, observed abnormalities glycolytic pathway. Glycolysis markedly retarded patient's muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA3PD) step, possibly due impaired reoxidation NADH produced GA3PD activity. Then, excess NADH reoxidized alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase triose phosphates drained alpha-glycerophosphate glycerol. Therefore ATP production significantly impaired muscle tissue damaged. genetical study revealed deletion 20 base-pairs exon 6 LDH-M subunit deficiency. mutation results frame-shift translation premature termination.
