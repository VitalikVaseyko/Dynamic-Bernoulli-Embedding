 consumption high-fat diets (HFDs) fasting known increase expression enzymes involved fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, reported ability physiological stressors induce enzymes FAO skeletal muscle blunted obesity. regard, sought explore effects potential mechanisms HFD expression FAO enzymes fed fasted state. consumption HFD increased mRNA expression protein content medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) fed state. Fasting increased mRNA expression PDK4, MCAD, UCP-3, protein content UCP-3 chow HFD rats. HFDs increase carnitine palmitoyl transfer-1 (CPT-1) mRNA levels fed state effects fasting markedly reduced compared chow-fed rats. expression peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1beta (PGC-1beta) increased muscle HFD rats fed state, PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC) increased fasting chow-fed HFD rats. Plasma fatty acid levels elevated fed state HFD rats increased fasting, whereas fasting increased plasma fatty acids chow-fed animals. Fasting-mediated increases plasma epinephrine, activation PKA AMPK skeletal muscle similar chow HFD rats. p38 MAPK phosphorylation increased fasting chow-fed HFD rats. findings suggest blunted effect fasting induction PDK4, MCAD, UCP3 skeletal muscle HFD rats likely result already elevated levels enzymes, induction associated increases plasma fatty acid PGC-1beta. hand, blunted induction PRC CPT-1 mRNA may explained decreases p38 MAPK signaling.
