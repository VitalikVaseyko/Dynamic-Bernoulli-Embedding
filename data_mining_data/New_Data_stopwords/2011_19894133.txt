 effect dietary carbohydrate complexity growth, feed utilization activity selected key liver enzymes intermediary metabolism studied gilthead sea bream juveniles. Four isonitrogenous (50% crude protein) isolipidic (16% crude lipids) diets formulated contain 20% pregelatinized maize starch, dextrin, maltose glucose. Triplicate groups fish (117 g initial weight) fed diet near satiation 6 weeks. effect dietary carbohydrate growth noticed. Feed efficiency lower fish fed glucose diet maltose dextrin diets. lowest protein efficiency ratio observed fish fed glucose diet. Six hours feeding, glycemia higher fish fed glucose diet maltose starch diets. Liver glycogen content unaffected dietary carbohydrate complexity. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) activity higher fish fed glucose maltose diets, higher pyruvate kinase (PK) activity recorded fish fed glucose diet fish fed starch diet. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities higher fish fed starch diet compared dextrin glucose diets. Data suggest dietary glucose maltose effective complex carbohydrates enhancing liver glycolytic activity. Dietary glucose also seems effective starch depressing liver gluconeogenic lipogenic activities. Overall, dietary maltose, dextrin starch better utilized glucose energy source gilthead sea bream juveniles.
