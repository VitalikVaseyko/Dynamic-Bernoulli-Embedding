 Maximal activities creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase cytochrome oxidase total concentrations creatine phosphorylated adenylates measured cardiac muscle hagfish, eight teleost species, frog, turtle, pigeon rat. ratio creatine kinase cytochrome oxidase cytochrome oxidase rough estimate aerobic capacity cellular "energy turnover", increased myocardia hagfish, turtle crucian carp. myocardia likely frequently exposed oxygen deficiency. agreement this, possess high relative glycolytic capacity indicated high pyruvate kinase/cytochrome oxidase ratio. creatine kinase/cytochrome oxidase ratio myocardia varied within factor 2, except value cod myocardium others. Total creatine varied among species high active species herring, pigeon rat also high crucian carp. variation total concentration phosphorylated adenylates considerably less variation total creatine. high creatine kinase/cytochrome oxidase ratio myocardia likely challenged hypoxia may represent enhanced efficiency "spatial" "temporal" buffering phosphorylated adenylates attenuate impact depressed energy liberation. differences total creatine, factor influences cellular energy distribution possibly also contractility via effect free phosphate level.
