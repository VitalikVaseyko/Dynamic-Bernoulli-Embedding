 Clinical prescription cisplatin, one widely used chemotherapeutic agents, limited side effects, particularly tubular injury-associated nephrotoxicity. Since details underlying mechanisms fully understood, investigated role pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury. Among PDK isoforms, PDK4 mRNA protein levels markedly increased kidneys mice treated cisplatin, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation involved cisplatin-induced renal PDK4 expression. Treatment PDK inhibitor sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) genetic knockout PDK4 attenuated signs cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, including apoptotic morphology kidney tubules along numbers TUNEL-positive cells, cleaved caspase-3, renal tubular injury markers. Cisplatin-induced suppression mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate, expression electron transport chain components, cytochrome c oxidase activity, disruption mitochondrial morphology noticeably improved kidneys DCA-treated PDK4 knockout mice. Additionally, levels oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal mitochondrial reactive oxygen species attenuated, whereas superoxide dismutase 2 catalase expression glutathione synthetase glutathione levels recovered DCA-treated PDK4 knockout mice. Interestingly, lipid accumulation considerably attenuated DCA-treated PDK4 knockout mice via recovered expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha coactivator PGC-1alpha, accompanied recovery mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, PDK4 mediates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, suggesting PDK4 might therapeutic target attenuating cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.
