 Age-related impairment functionality central nervous system (CNS) associated increased susceptibility develop many neurodegenerative diseases. Increased oxidative stress CNS aged animals manifested increased protein oxidation, believed contribute age-related learning memory deficits. Glutamate dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction impaired protein synthesis observed aged brains, along increased protein oxidation. Interestingly, age-related cellular alterations improved caloric restriction (CR), also improve plasticity recovery CNS. Although beneficial effects CR brains well established, mechanism(s) action remains unclear. order gain insight mechanism CR brain, located brain regions benefited reduced oxidative stress CR. Along brain regions, striatum (ST) showed significantly decreased bulk protein carbonyl levels hippocampus (HP) showed decreased bulk protein 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels CR aged rats compared age matched controls. determine proteins oxidatively modified brain regions, used parallel proteomics approach identify proteins altered oxidation expression. specific carbonyl levels pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), alpha-enolase (ENO1), inositol monophosphatase (INSP1), F1-ATPase Chain B (ATP-F1B) significantly decreased ST aged CR rats. contrast, expression levels phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PKG1), inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (IMPCH) F1-ATPase Chain (ATP-F1A) significantly increased ST CR rats. hippocampus CR rats, specific 3-NT levels malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PKG1) 14-3-3 zeta protein significantly decreased expression levels DLP1 splice variant 1 (DLP1), mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH), neuroprotective peptide H3 (NPH3), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) increased. Moreover, unnamed protein product (UNP1) similar sequence initiation factor 2 (IF-2) decreased HP CR rats. data support hypothesis CR induces mild metabolic stress response increasing production neurotrophic proteins, therefore, priming neurons apoptosis. Moreover, study shows improvement glutamate dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction protein synthesis CR is, least partially, due CR-mediated alteration oxidation expression PKM2, ENO1, INSP1, ATP-F1B, PKG1, IMPCH, ATP-F1A MDH, PKG1 14-3-3 zeta protein, DLP1, ACO2, DLDH, NPH3, eIF-5A UNP1. study provides valuable insights mechanisms beneficial factors brain aging CR.
