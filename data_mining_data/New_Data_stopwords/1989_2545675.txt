 Hepatocytes isolated adult fasted rats cultured presence thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, serum-free medium conserve essentials differentiated function hormonal sensitivity least 1 week. cells, gene L-type pyruvate kinase expressed glucose insulin present together, inactive itself. Inhibition expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene occurs glucose and/or insulin removed culture medium associated accumulation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA, argues involvement intracellular cyclic AMP phenomenon. Rather, transcriptional activator, derived carbohydrate metabolism accumulating presence insulin, seems needed support expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene. Glucagon, vitro vivo, inhibits production L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs. addition roles production mRNAs, glucose insulin one hand glucagon profound effects stability L-type pyruvate kinase messengers: half-life mRNA whose production blocked actinomycin 1 h presence glucagon 24 h presence glucose insulin. Glucagon glucose/insulin partially antagonize other's effect mRNA stability.
