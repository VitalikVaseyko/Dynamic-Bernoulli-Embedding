 Enzymatic nonenzymatic mixed-function oxidase systems shown generate oxidant catalyzes inactivation glutamine synthetase metabolic enzymes. Recent studies shown microsomes isolated rats chronically fed ethanol generate reactive oxygen intermediates elevated rates compared controls. Microsomes rats fed ethanol found effective control microsomes catalyzing inactivation enzymes added incubation system. enzymes studied alcohol dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase. inactivation process types microsomal preparations sensitive catalase glutathione plus glutathione peroxidase, affected superoxide dismutase hydroxyl radical scavengers. Iron required inactivation added enzymes; microsomes rats fed ethanol remained effective control microsomes catalyzing inactivation enzymes absence presence several ferric complexes. inactivation enzymes enhanced addition menadione paraquat microsomes, rates inactivation higher microsomes ethanol-fed rats. enhanced generation reactive oxygen intermediates increased inactivation enzymes microsomes may contribute toward hepatotoxic effects associated ethanol consumption.
