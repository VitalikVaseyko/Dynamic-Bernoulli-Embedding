 Loss anchorage extracellular matrix leads apoptosis (anoikis) normal cells, cancerous cells usually resistant stress. report pivotal role E3 ubiquitin ligase, ring-finger protein 126 (RNF126), resistance cancer cells stress associated non-adherent conditions. Non-adherent cancer cells exhibited increased flux tricarboxylic acid cycle via increased conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. RNF126 found act ubiquitin ligase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), resulting proteasomal degradation. decrease PDK levels allowed pyruvate dehydrogenases catalyze conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Moreover, depletion RNF126 increased expression PDK1 cancer cells suppressed colony formation soft agar well tumorigenicity mice. RNF126 expression cancer cells found control extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway, essential anoikis resistance. Thus, RNF126 attractive molecule treating cancer selectively targeting anchorage-independent growth.
