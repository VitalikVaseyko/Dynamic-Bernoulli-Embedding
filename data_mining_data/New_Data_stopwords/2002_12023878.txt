 aim present study determine whether peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) deficiency disrupts normal regulation triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation, hepatic lipogenesis glycogenesis fatty acids insulin using PPARalpha-null mice. wild-type mice, hepatic TAG concentrations increased (P<0.01) fasting (24 h), substantial reversal refeeding (6 h). Hepatic TAG levels fed PPARalpha-null mice 2.4-fold higher wild-type (P<0.05), increased fasting, remained elevated refeeding. PPARalpha deficiency also impaired hepatic glycogen repletion (P<0.001), despite normal insulin glucose levels refeeding. Higher levels plasma insulin required support similar levels hepatic lipogenesis de novo ((3)H(2)O incorporation) PPARalpha-null mice compared wild-type. difference reflected corresponding changes relationship plasma insulin mRNA expression lipogenic transcription factor sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c, one known targets, fatty acid synthase. wild-type mice, hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 protein expression (a downstream marker altered fatty acid catabolism) increased (P<0.01) response fasting, suppression (P<0.001) refeeding. Although PDK4 up-regulation fasting halved PPARalpha deficiency, PDK4 suppression refeeding attenuated. summary, PPARalpha deficiency leads accumulation hepatic TAG elicits dysregulation hepatic lipid carbohydrate metabolism, emphasizing importance precise control lipid oxidation hepatic fuel homoeostasis.
