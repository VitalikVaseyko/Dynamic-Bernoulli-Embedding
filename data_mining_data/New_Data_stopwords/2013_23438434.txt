 Snail, repressor E-cadherin gene transcription, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition involved tumor progression. Snail also mediates resistance cell death induced serum depletion. contrast, observed snail-expressing MDCK (MDCK/snail) cells undergo cell death higher rate control (MDCK/neo) cells low-glucose medium. Therefore, investigated whether snail expression influences cell metabolism MDCK cells. Although gylcolysis affected MDCK/snail cells, exhibit reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, controls pyruvate entry tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Indeed, activity multiple enzymes involved TCA cycle decreased MDCK/snail cells, including mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), electron transport Complex II Complex IV. Consequently, lower ATP content, lower oxygen consumption increased survival hypoxic conditions also observed MDCK/snail cells compared MDCK/neo cells. addition, expression promoter activity pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), phosphorylates inhibits activity PDH, increased MDCK/snail cells, expression levels glutaminase 2 (GLS2) ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), involved glutaminolysis fatty acid synthesis, decreased MDCK/snail cells. results suggest snail modulates cell metabolism altering expression activity key enzymes. results enhanced glucose dependency leads cell death low-glucose conditions. hand, reduced requirements oxygen nutrients surrounding environment, might confer resistance cell death induced hypoxia malnutrition.
