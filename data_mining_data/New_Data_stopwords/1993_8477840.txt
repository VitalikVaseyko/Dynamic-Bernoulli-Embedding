 Despite significant increases circulating concentrations lipid fuels (triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) ketone bodies) late-pregnant rats sampled fed (absorptive) state, cardiac skeletal muscle active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) activities remained comparable observed fed, age-matched virgin controls. Cardiac PDHa activity suppressed response acute (6 h) starvation late-pregnant (as well virgin) rats: inactivation opposed inhibition mitochondrial long-chain FA oxidation. Starvation (6 h) also led PDH inactivation skeletal muscles late-pregnant, virgin, rats. Starvation 24 h led suppression cardiac PDHa activity associated significant increases PDH kinase activities virgin late-pregnant rats. Late pregnancy influence cardiac PDH kinase activity.
