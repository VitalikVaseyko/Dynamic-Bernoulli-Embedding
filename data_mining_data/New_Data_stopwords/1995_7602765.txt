 Recent progress biotechnology tremendous application isozyme diagnosis altered. First, mechanism isozyme system molecular level revealed clinical assessment isozymes followed. Several examples shown: tumor-producing amylase caused translocation amylase gene; serum cholinesterase encoded one gene; pyruvate kinase gene two independent exon, containing translation initiator signal; electrophoretic variant lactate dehydrogenase caused missense mutation; alkaline phosphatase isozymes constituted different allele products post-translational modification. Second, improvement assay procedure using biotechnology made isozyme analysis easier, faster, convenient precise. Stable enzymes monoclonal antibodies produced enzymes utilized different recognition isozymes. believed diagnostic system isozymes established detail.
