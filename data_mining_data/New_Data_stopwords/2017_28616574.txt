 Argininosuccinate Synthetase 1 deficiency induces dependence extracellular arginine continued cellular growth survival. Arginine starvation inhibits Warburg effect diverts glucose serine biosynthesis, simultaneously increasing glutamine metabolism via tricarboxylic acid cycle. Simultaneous arginine deprivation inhibition subsequent metabolic adaptations induce synthetic lethality.
