 anucleate mature erythrocyte also lacks ribosomes mitochondria thus cannot synthesize enzymes derive energy Krebs citric acid cycle. Nevertheless, red blood cell metabolically active contains numerous residual enzymes products essential survival normal functioning. Enzyme deficiencies Embden-Myerhoff glycolytic pathway result nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (NSHA), also associated neuromuscular neurologic disorders. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency hexose monophosphate shunt also results hemolytic anemia, especially following exposure various drugs. Defects glutathione synthesis pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency also cause NSHA, increased adenosine deaminase activity. Gluthathione synthetase deficiency limited red cell also presents oxoprolinuria neurologic signs. red cell enzyme defects appear single gene errors, cases recessive inheritance, either autosomal X-linked.
