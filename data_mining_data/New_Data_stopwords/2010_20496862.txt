 Protein malnutrition utero induces permanent changes metabolism investigated intensively various animals recent years, best knowledge, yet mink, strict carnivore. present study, minks fed either low-protein (LP) diet, i.e., protein:fat:carbohydrate ratio 14:51:35% metabolisable energy (ME), adequate-protein diet (AP), i.e. 29:56:15% ME, implantation completed parturition (17.9 +/- 3.6 days). Respiration balance experiments performed gestation lactation. Plasma concentrations leptin, IGF-1, insulin determined radioimmunoassay; relative abundances glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase), phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase (PKM2) determined liver, abundances adiponectin leptin adipose tissue determined real-time quantitative PCR (q PCR). protein supply affected quantitative metabolism traits period differentiated feeding. dietary composition reflected nitrogen metabolism substrate oxidation, effects remained lactation. LP dams tended smaller liver mass relation body weight AP dams (2.5% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.09), significantly less leptin mRNA (p < 0.05), 30.6% fewer kits per mated female (p = 0.03). Furthermore, F1-generation kits exposed protein restriction foetal life (FLP1; 10.3 g) lower birth weight (p = 0.004) F1-generation kits exposed adequate protein (FAP1; 11.3 g). Differences remained significant 21 days age (120.4 g vs. 127.6 g; p = 0.005). FLP1 foetuses displayed lower abundance Fru-1,6-P2ase mRNA (p = 0.007) PKM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) FAP1 foetuses. Whether changes foetal life cause permanent changes glucose homeostasis offspring result transmission epigenetic phenotypic changes, seen rat, needs investigation.
