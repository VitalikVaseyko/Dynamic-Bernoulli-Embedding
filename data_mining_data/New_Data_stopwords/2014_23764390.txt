 Several inositol isomers particular myo-inositol (MI) D-chiro-inositol (DCI), shown possess insulin-mimetic properties efficient lowering post-prandial blood glucose. addition, abnormalities inositol metabolism associated insulin resistance long term microvascular complications diabetes, supporting role inositol derivatives glucose metabolism. aim review focus potential benefits dietary supplement myo-inositol, far common inositol isomer foodstuffs, human disorders associated insulin resistance (polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome) prevention treatment diabetic complications (neuropathy, nephropathy, cataract). relevance nutritional strategy discussed context basis clinical and/or animal studies. dietary sources myo-inositol metabolism dietary uptake renal excretion also covered review. Finally, actual insights inositol insulin-sensitizing effects addressed particular possible role inositol glycans insulin second messengers.
