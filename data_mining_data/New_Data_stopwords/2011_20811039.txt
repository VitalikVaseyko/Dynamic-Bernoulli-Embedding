 OBJECTIVE: Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) constitutes one main clinical obstacles optimum treatment type 1 diabetes. Neurons ventromedial hypothalamus thought mediate counterregulatory responses hypoglycemia. previously hypothesized hypoglycemia-induced hypothalamic angiotensin might contribute HAAF, suggesting angiotensin blocker valsartan might prevent HAAF. hand, clinical studies demonstrated opioid receptor blocker naloxone ameliorates HAAF. goal study generate novel hypothalamic markers hypoglycemia use assess mechanisms mediating HAAF reversal. RESEARCH DESIGN METHODS: Quantitative PCR used validate novel panel hypothalamic genes regulated hypoglycemia. Mice exposed one five episodes insulin-induced hypoglycemia, without concurrent exposure valsartan naloxone. Corticosterone, glucagon, epinephrine, hypothalamic gene expression assessed final episode hypoglycemia. RESULTS: subset hypothalamic genes regulated acutely hypoglycemia failed respond repetitive hypoglycemia. Responsiveness subset genes preserved naloxone valsartan. Notably, hypothalamic expression four genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1, acutely induced single episode hypoglycemia, antecedent hypoglycemia; naloxone treatment prevented failure. Similarly, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibited repetitive hypoglycemia, inhibition prevented naloxone. Repetitive hypoglycemia also caused loss hypoglycemia-induced elevation glucocorticoid secretion, failure prevented naloxone valsartan. CONCLUSIONS: Based observations speculate acute hypoglycemia induces reprogramming hypothalamic metabolism away glycolysis toward beta-oxidation, HAAF associated reversal reprogramming, naloxone preserves responses hypoglycemia preventing reversal.
