 Pyruvate kinase deficiency studied biochemically ten homozygous seven heterozygous individuals previously examined clinically hematologically (see part I). crude hemolysates properties deficient enzymes found altered. pH optimum shifted towards alkaline range, thermal optimum found 17 27 degrees Cinstead 37 und 47 degrees C. abnormal enzymes much less stable normal pyruvate Kinase (PK), susceptible inhibition adenosinetriphosphate. affinity adenosinediphosphate normal cases whereas affinity phosphoenolpyruvate either normal (two cases/, increased (two cases) slightly decreased (six cases). Fructosediphosphate activated abnormal enzymes factor 1.5--18 simultaneously transformed sigmoidal affinity curve phosphoenolpyruvate hyperbolic curve known normal enzyme. consumption glucose formation lactate higher PK deficient erythrocytes normal cells lower erythrocyte populations similar reticulocyte counts. formation 2,3-diphosphoglycerate markedly increased, whereas breakdown low. close relation degree reticulocytosis impairment glucose metabolism found. patients high reticulocyte counts, i.e. splenectomized patients, highest concentrations glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate 2,3-diphosphoglycerate well high formation low breakdown 2,3-diphosphoglycerate deficit lactate formation found. heterozygotes, small increases concentration glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate 3-phosphoglycerate demonstrated. results support conclusion PK deficiency mainly disorder reticulocytes. metabolism grossly deteriorates within venous sinuses spleen. Splenectomy improves clinical course critical area microcirculation highly unfavourable metabolic milieu eliminated.
