 Lactic acidosis buildup lactic acid blood tissues, due several inborn errors metabolism well nongenetic conditions. Deficiency pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) common genetic disorder leading lactic acidosis. Phosphorylation specific serine residues E1alpha subunit PDHC pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inactivates enzyme, whereas dephosphorylation restores PDHC activity. found phenylbutyrate enhances PDHC enzymatic activity vitro vivo increasing proportion unphosphorylated enzyme inhibition PDK. Phenylbutyrate given C57BL/6 wild-type mice results significant increase PDHC enzyme activity reduction phosphorylated E1alpha brain, muscle, liver compared saline-treated mice. means recombinant enzymes, showed phenylbutyrate prevents phosphorylation E1alpha binding inhibition PDK, providing molecular explanation effect phenylbutyrate PDHC activity. Phenylbutyrate increases PDHC activity fibroblasts PDHC-deficient patients harboring various molecular defects corrects morphological, locomotor, biochemical abnormalities noa(m631) zebrafish model PDHC deficiency. mice, phenylbutyrate prevents systemic lactic acidosis induced partial hepatectomy. phenylbutyrate already approved human use diseases, findings study potential rapidly translated treatment patients PDHC deficiency forms primary secondary lactic acidosis.
