 Rapidly proliferating cells require increased rate metabolism allow production nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes final step glycolysis pathway, different isoforms display vastly different catalytic efficiencies. M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2) strongly expressed cancer cells contributes aerobic glycolysis commonly termed Warburg effect. Here, show PKM2 covalently modified lipid electrophiles 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE). HNE ONE modify multiple sites PKM2 vitro, including Cys424 His439, play role protein-protein interactions fructose 1,6-bis-phosphate binding, respectively. Modification sites results dose-dependent decrease enzymatic activity. addition, high concentrations electrophile, notably case ONE, result substantial protein-protein cross-linking vitro cells. Exposure RKO cells electrophiles results modification monomeric PKM2 dose-dependent manner. concomitant decrease PKM2 activity cells upon ONE exposure, HNE exposure. Together, data suggest modification PKM2 certain electrophiles results kinase inactivation.
