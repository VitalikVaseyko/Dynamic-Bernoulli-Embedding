 activity enzymes regulatory function pathways glycolysis, gluconeogenesis NADP-generation investigated 50 placentae normal pregnancies deliveries, 23 placentae women gestational diabetes, 12 placentae insulin-dependent patients. placentae gestational diabetic group, activity pyruvate kinase NADPH-generating enzymes raised activity enzymes connected glucogenesis unchanged. alterations attributed oversupply glucose insulin morphologically normal well-oxygenated placental tissue. placentae insulin-dependent group, activity pyruvate kinase reduced, activity NADPH-generating enzymes enhanced activity related gluconeogenesis unchanged. suggested pattern enzyme changes reflects reduction glycolytic capacity placentae, may due inhibition products enhanced fatty acid oxidation diabetes, amino acids and/or long-term anoxia result uteroplacental circulatory disturbances. possible relation reduced energy-forming capacity placenta diabetes transport function discussed.
