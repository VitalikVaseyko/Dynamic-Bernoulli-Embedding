 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase shown catalyze decarboxylation oxalacetate (Creighton, D.J. Rose, I.A. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 61). Noncovalent covalent modifiers enzyme used assess whether decarboxylase kinase reactions take place common site. Phosphoenol-alpha-ketobutyrate, analog substrate phosphoenol-pyruvate, inhibits decarboxylase kinase competitively nearly identical Ki values (5.7 micron 4.8 micron, respectively). Oxalate, analog enol-pyruvate, inhibits competitively similar Ki values (11 micron 4.7 micron, respectively). activities lost parallel upon reaction dithionitrobenzoate, active-site specific. results indicate two activities share common site enzyme. But, effects following modifiers suggest different amino acid residues site participate two reactions: phenylalanine inhibition fructose 1,6-bisphosphate activation effective decarboxylase; iodoacetamide preferentially inactivates decarboxylase trinitrobenzenesulfonate preferentially inactivates kinase.
