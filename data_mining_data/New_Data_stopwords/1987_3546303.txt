 Substantial evidence suggests insulin receptor-associated protein kinase may play pivotal role expression intracellular effects insulin. study undertaken determine whether insulin receptor kinase contributes generation putative insulin mediators. effect ATP divalent cation addition production insulin mediators liver plasma membranes investigated. ATP (1 mM) added liver plasma membranes absence divalent cations enhanced insulin-stimulated release/generation mediator slightly (approximately 3-fold). ATP presence Mn2+ increased release/generation mediator markedly (approximately 100-fold). contrast, ATP presence Mg2+ stimulatory effect. Mn2+ Mg2+ alone ineffective. Addition EDTA completely diminished stimulatory effects insulin, ATP, Mn2+. stimulation ATP-specific since nucleotides nonhydrolyzable analogues ATP weak activity. ATP-Mn2+ stimulated insulin-dependent mediator release/generation dose-dependent manner. results suggest insulin mediator release/generation markedly stimulated ATP-Mn2+-dependent phosphorylation reaction, similar insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation.
