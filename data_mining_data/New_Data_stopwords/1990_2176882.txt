 Steady-state kinetic studies muscle pyruvate kinase conducted function pH phenylalanine concentrations. Results show pH 7.0, observable effect phenylalanine kinetic properties muscle pyruvate kinase. results pH 6.5 used state comparison, kinetic results show phenylalanine proton exert synergistic effect allosteric properties enzyme. significantly greater change Hill coefficients high pH detected presence phenylalanine absence. pinpoint specific mechanism leads synergistic effect, kinetic data resolved five equilibrium two rate constants characterize basic two-state model. shown KTI, binding constant phenylalanine inactive state, strongly proton-linked. affinity phenylalanine state increases increasing pH. pH dependence KTI analyzed linked-function theory [Wyman, J. (1964) Adv. Protein Chem. 19, 224-285], shown deprotonation favors phenylalanine binding state. KRI (the binding constant phenylalanine active R state), KTS (the binding constant substrate state), L (the isomerization constant two states) weakly proton-linked also shown protonation favors ligand-pyruvate kinase complex. KRS, binding constant substrate R state, shows observable linkage proton concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
