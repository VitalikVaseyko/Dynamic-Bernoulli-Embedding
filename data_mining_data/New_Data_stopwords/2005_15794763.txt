 synthesis ATP human parasite Entamoeba histolytica carried solely glycolytic pathway. Little kinetic structural information available pathway enzymes. report gene cloning, overexpression purification hexokinase, hexose-6-phosphate isomerase, inorganic pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6 bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO), triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), enolase, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) enzymes E. histolytica. Kinetic characterization 10 recombinant enzymes made, establishing kinetic constants optimal physiological pH values, analyzing effect activators inhibitors, investigating storage stability oligomeric state. Determination catalytic efficiencies pH optimum pH values resemble amoebal trophozoites performed enzyme identify possible controlling steps. analysis suggested PGAM, ALDO, GAPDH, PPDK might flux control steps, showed lowest catalytic efficiencies. vitro reconstruction final stages glycolysis made determine flux control coefficients. results indicate PGAM PPDK exhibit high control coefficient values physiological pH.
