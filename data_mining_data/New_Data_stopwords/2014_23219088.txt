 protective effect pyruvate ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced damage investigated human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Although pyruvate inhibit UVB-induced stimulation intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, improve survival rate UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Furthermore, pyruvate suppressed UVB-induced mRNA expression inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). decrease associated reduced secretion IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) culture media. addition, pyruvate reversed phosphorylation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), induced UVB-irradiation, HaCaT cells increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation sham-irradiated cells. UVB-induced production IL-6 inhibited SB203580, p38 MAPK inhibitor. results suggested pyruvate inhibits UVB-mediated inflammatory response inhibiting p38 MAPK activation.
