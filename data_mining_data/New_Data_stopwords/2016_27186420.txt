 Hyaluronan expressed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HCC generally arises cirrhotic liver excessive production accumulation HA leads developing cirrhosis. Though suggested HA involved progression HCC, mechanisms underlying connection HA HCC progression unclear. Since increased aerobic glycolysis metabolic trait malignant cells HA-CD44 modulate glucose metabolism, aim investigate roles PKM2, key enzyme glucose metabolism, HA-CD44 axis facilitated progress HCC. shown PKM2 required HA-promoted HCC progression, modulated PKM2 kinase activity nuclear translocation PKM2. PKM2 translocation Erk (Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation dependent, functioned downstream HA-CD44 binding. Furthermore, elevated HA expression significantly correlated PKM2 nuclear location independent factors predicting poor HCC prognosis. conclusions PKM2 nuclear translocation required mediating described HA biological effects HCC progression results imply inhibition HA may therapeutic value treating HCC.
