 1980s, Shiio coworkers demonstrated using random mutagenesis following three phenotypes effective boosting lysine production Corynebacterium glutamicum: (1) low-activity-level citrate synthase (CS(L)), (2) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) resistant feedback inhibition aspartic acid (PEPC(R)), (3) pyruvate kinase (PYK) deficiency. Here, reevaluated phenotypes interrelationship lysine production using recombinant DNA techniques.The pyk deletion PEPC(R) (D299N ppc) independently showed marginal effects lysine production, phenotypes synergistically increased lysine yield, demonstrating importance PEPC anaplerotic enzyme lysine production. Similar effects also found glutamic acid production. CS(L) (S252C gltA) increased lysine yield. Thus, using molecular techniques, combination three phenotypes reconfirmed effective lysine production. However, simple CS(L) mutant showed instabilities growth lysine yield.Surprisingly, pyk deletion found increase biomass production wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13032 biotin-sufficient conditions. mutant showed 37% increase growth (based OD660) compared ATCC13032 strain complex medium containing 100 g/L glucose. Metabolome analysis revealed intracellular accumulation excess precursor metabolites. Thus, conversion biomass considered relieve metabolic distortion pyk-deleted mutant. Detailed physiological studies various pyk-deleted mutants also suggested malate:quinone oxidoreductase (MQO) important control intracellular oxaloacetic acid (OAA) level respiration rate. findings may facilitate rational use C. glutamicum fermentation industries.
