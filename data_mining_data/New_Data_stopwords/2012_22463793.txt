 Recent studies Mn(2+) transport mutants indicate manganese essential unstressed growth bacterial species, required primarily induced stress responses others. Bradyrhizobium japonicum mutant defective high-affinity Mn(2+) transporter gene mntH severe growth phenotype manganese limitation, suggesting requirement metal unstressed growth. Here, found activities superoxide dismutase glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase deficient mntH strain grown manganese limitation. identified pykM pyruvate kinase-encoding gene based deficiency activity pykM mutant, rescue growth phenotype pyruvate, pyruvate kinase activity purified recombinant PykM. PykM unusual required Mn(2+) rather Mg(2+) high activity, neither fructose-1,6-bisphosphate AMP positive allosteric effector. mntH-dependent superoxide dismutase encoded sodM, expressed superoxide dismutase-encoding gene unstressed growth conditions. mntH mutant grew slowly pyruvate manganese-limited conditions pykM sodM double mutant, implying additional manganese-dependent processes. findings implicate roles manganese key steps unstressed oxidative metabolism B. japonicum.
