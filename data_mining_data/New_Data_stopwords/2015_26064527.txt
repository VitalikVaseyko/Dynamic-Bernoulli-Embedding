 transition inactive T-state (apoenzyme) active R-state (effector bound enzyme) Trypanosoma cruzi pyruvate kinase (PYK) accompanied symmetrical 8 degrees rigid body rocking motion A- C-domain cores four subunits, coupled formation additional salt bridges across two four subunit interfaces. salt bridges provide increased tetramer stability correlated enhanced specificity constant (k cat/S 0.5). detailed kinetic structural comparison potential drug target PYKs pathogenic protists T. cruzi, T. brucei Leishmania mexicana shows allosteric mechanism conserved. contrast, structural comparison trypanosomatid PYKs evolutionarily divergent PYKs humans bacteria shows adopted different allosteric strategies. underlying principle case maximize (k cat/S 0.5) stabilizing rigidifying tetramer active R-state conformation. However, bacterial mammalian PYKs evolved alternative ways locking tetramers together. contrast divergent allosteric mechanisms, PYK active sites highly conserved across species. Selective disruption varied allosteric mechanisms may therefore provide useful approach design species-specific inhibitors.
