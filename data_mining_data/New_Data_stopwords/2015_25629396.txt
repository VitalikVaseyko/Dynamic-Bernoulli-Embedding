 study allosteric proteins, understanding effector-protein interactions contribute allosteric activation important designing allosteric drugs understanding allosteric mechanisms. antihyperglycemic target, human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK), binds allosteric activator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP), 1'-phosphate interacts side chains Arg501 Trp494 6'-phosphate interacts Thr444, Thr446, Ser449 (i.e., 444-449 loop), Ser531. Additionally, backbone atoms 527-533 loop interact sugar ring hydroxyl two effector phosphate moieties. effector analogue series indicates one phosphate sugar required activation. However, singly phosphorylated sugars, including Fru-1-P Fru-6-P, bind Kix range 0.07-1 mM. second phosphate Fru-1,6-BP causes tight effector binding, native effector Kix 0.061 muM. Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate bind 0.07-1 mM range. contrast higher Fru-1,6-BP binding indicates specificity fructose sugar conformation. Site-directed random mutagenesis residue contacts bound Fru-1,6-BP showed negative charge introduced position 531 mimics allosteric activation, even absence Fru-1,6-BP. Collectively, analogue mutagenesis studies consistent 527-533 loop playing key role allosteric function. Deletion mutations shortened 527-533 loop expected prevent formation hydrogen bonds backbone atoms loop Fru-1,6-BP. Indeed, Fru-1,6-BP activate loop-shortened mutant proteins. Previous structural comparisons M1-PYK M2-PYK indicate 527-533 loop makes interactions across subunit interface activator present. Mutating hL-PYK subunit interface interactions among Trp527, Arg528, Asp499 mimics allosteric activation. Considered published structures, results consistent (1) two phosphates Fru-1,6-BP docking Arg501/Trp494 444-449 loop, respectively, (2) formation hydrogen bonds among Fru-1,6-BP backbone atoms 527-533 loop pulling loop away subunit interface, results breaking Trp527-Arg528-Asp499 interactions elicit allosteric response.
