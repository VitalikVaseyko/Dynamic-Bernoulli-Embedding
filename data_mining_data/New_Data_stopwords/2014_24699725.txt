 BACKGROUND: Screening colorectal cancer improves outcomes cost effective. Stool-based tests highest participation rates screening programmes. efficacy limited relatively low sensitivity specificity compared colonoscopy. Stool levels M2-PK, dimeric form enzyme pyruvate kinase, correlate colorectal cancer neoplasia. combination stool markers may enhance screening performance; however, remains determined whether additional test would affect participation rates negatively. AIMS: aim study assess performance faecal M2-PK faecal immunochemical test (FIT) combined effect screening programme. MATERIALS METHODS: Within round 2 biennial FIT-based pilot, invitations additionally included M2-PK kit. FIT greater 100 ngHb/ml and/or M2-PK greater 4 U/ml considered positive. FIT-positive M2-PK-positive patients offered colonoscopy. RESULTS: all, 1800 combined M2-PK FIT invites sent out, 879 (49%) samples analysed. Overall positivity 27% (n=245). 23 (2.6%) patients positive tests. all, 186 (88%) screening colonoscopies performed. adenoma detection rate M2-PK-positive patients (n=157) significant 25% (n=40), 3% (n=5) advanced lesions. FIT-positive patients (n=51), adenoma detection rate 29% (n=15), significantly more, 21% (n=11), advanced lesions (P<0.001, confidence interval 0.117-0.156). FIT tested, 70% (n=35) fewer patients would polyps removed. CONCLUSION: addition M2-PK biennial bowel screening programme acceptable patients, feasible detects additional adenomas, potentially earlier stage.
