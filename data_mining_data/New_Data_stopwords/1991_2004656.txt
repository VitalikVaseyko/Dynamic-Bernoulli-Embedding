 Human peripheral lymphocytes activated concanavalin phorbol myristate ester exhibit increase glycolysis time-course similar DNA synthesis. Elevated glycolysis accompanied increased specific activities glycolytic enzymes. Increased enzyme activities accounted appearance specific isoenzyme forms (muscle forms) normally expressed rapidly growing tumor cells growth-stimulated cells. present study analyzed expression glycolytic isoenzymes cell cycle progression activated human lymphocytes using two-parameter (DNA protein) flow cytometry. Time-course studies analysis subpopulations prepared elutriation centrifugation showed inducible isoenzymes expressed low levels G0 cells. expressed first G0 G1 transition early G1. However, expression increases throughout G1, reaching maximum S-phase. Thus, induction glycolytic isoenzymes provides excellent marker T-cell activation progression toward DNA synthesis.
