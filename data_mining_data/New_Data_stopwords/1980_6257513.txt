 Rat liver soluble proteins phosphorylated endogenous protein kinase [gamma-32P]ATP. Proteins separated dodecyl sulphate slab gels detected aid autoradiography. relative role cAMP-dependent, cAMP-independent Ca2+-activated protein kinases phosphorylation soluble proteins investigated. Heat-stable inhibitor cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits nearly completed phosphorylation seven proteins, including L-type pyruvate kinase. phosphorylation eight proteins influenced protein kinase inhibitor. phosphorylation six proteins, including phosphorylase, partially inhibited protein kinase inhibitor. results indicate phosphoproteins rat liver subdivided three groups: phosphoproteins phosphorylated (a) cAMP-dependent protein kinase (b) cAMP-independent protein kinase; (c) phosphoproteins cAMP-dependent cAMP-independent protein kinase play role phosphorylation. relative phosphorylation rate substrates cAMP-dependent protein kinase 15-fold phosphorylation rate substrates cAMP-independent protein kinase. Km ATP cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylase kinase 8 microM 38 microM, respectively. Ca2+ micromolare range stimulates phosphorylation (a) phosphorylase, (b) protein molecular weight 130 000 (c) protein molecular weight 15 000. phosphate incorporation protein molecular weight 115 000 inhibited Ca2+. Phosphorylation phosphorylase 15 000-Mr protein presence 100 microM Ca2+ could completely inhibited trifluoperazine. concluded calmodulin involved phosphorylation least two soluble proteins. evidence Ca2+-stimulated phosphorylation subunits glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, found. indicates unlikely direct phosphorylation Ca2+-dependent protein kinases involved stimulation gluconeogenesis hormones act cAMP-independent, Ca2+-dependent mechanism.
