 previously showed insulin profound effect suppress pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4 expression rat skeletal muscle. present study, examined whether insulin's effect PDK4 expression impaired acute insulin-resistant states and, so, whether change accompanied decreased insulin's effects stimulate Akt forkhead box class (FOXO) 1 phosphorylation. induce insulin resistance, conscious overnight-fasted rats received constant infusion Intralipid lactate 5 h, control group received saline infusion. Following initial infusions, group received saline insulin infusion (n = 6 7 each) additional 5 h, saline, Intralipid, lactate infusion continued. Plasma glucose clamped basal levels insulin infusion. Compared control group, Intralipid lactate infusions decreased glucose infusion rates required clamp plasma glucose approximately 60% (P < 0.01), confirming induction insulin resistance. Insulin's ability suppress PDK4 mRNA level impaired skeletal muscle Intralipid lactate infusions, resulting two- threefold higher PDK4 mRNA levels insulin (P < 0.05). Insulin stimulation Akt FOXO1 phosphorylation also significantly decreased Intralipid lactate infusions. data suggest insulin's effect suppress PDK4 gene expression skeletal muscle impaired insulin-resistant states, may due impaired insulin signaling stimulation Akt FOXO1 phosphorylation. Impaired insulin's effect suppress PDK4 expression may explain association PDK4 overexpression insulin resistance skeletal muscle.
