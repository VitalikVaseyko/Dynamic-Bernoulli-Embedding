 generally recognized activities red cell enzymes decline cell ages. However, still controversy regarding rate aging occurs. present study applied newly developed technology specific isolation maturing reticulocytes/erythrocytes comprehensive study vivo aging red cell enzymes rabbits. Anemia induced repeated phlebotomy, reticulocyte-rich erythrocytes labeled N-hydroxy succinimido-biotin transfused normal rabbit. biotinylated cells isolated various time points affinity avidin support, enzymatic activity 19 red cell enzymes measured. observed biphasic pattern decay activity six age-dependent enzymes--aldolase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, pyruvate kinase.
