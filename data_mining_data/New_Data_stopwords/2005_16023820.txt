 Considering pyruvate kinase activity, crucial enzyme glucose metabolism energy liberation brain, may regulated amino acids, possible diminution enzyme activity may contribute brain damage caused amino acids accumulated metabolic diseases, phenylalanine, tryptophan cystine. Therefore, present study undertaken investigate effect amino acids pyruvate kinase activity brain cortex rats. also investigated effect serine alanine pyruvate kinase activity tissue. results suggested phenylalanine, tryptophan, cystine, alanine, serine act site enzyme, phenylalanine, tryptophan, cystine causing inhibition, alanine serine preventing effect. Cystine also inhibited enzyme activity different mechanism, possibly acting enzyme thiol groups. Considering enzyme target amino acids accumulated metabolic diseases amino acid metabolism, possible inhibition may contribute brain damage found diseases.
