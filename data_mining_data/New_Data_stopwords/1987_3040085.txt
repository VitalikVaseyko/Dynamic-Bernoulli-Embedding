 2 equiv divalent cation required cofactors pyruvate kinase reside sites different affinities different species cation [Baek, Y. H., & Nowak, T. (1982) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 217, 491-497]. intrinsic selectivity protein-based site Mn(II) nucleotide-based site Mg(II) exploited electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) investigations ligands Mn(II) protein-based site. Oxalate, structural analogue enolate pyruvate, used surrogate reactive form pyruvate complexes enzyme, Mn(II), Mg(II), ATP. Addition Mg(II) solutions enzyme, Mn(II), ATP, oxalate sharpens EPR signals enzyme-bound Mn(II). Superhyperfine coupling unpaired electron spin Mn(II) nuclear spin 17O, specifically incorporated oxalate, shows oxalate bound active site bidentate chelate Mn(II). Coordination gamma-phosphate ATP Mn(II) center revealed observation superhyperfine coupling form 17O regiospecifically incorporated gamma-phosphate group ATP. contrast, 17O alpha-phosphate beta-phosphate groups ATP influence spectrum. Experiments 17O-enriched water show also single water ligand bound Mn(II). data indicate ATP bridges Mn(II) Mg(II) active site. close spacing two divalent cations also evident occurrence magnetic interactions complexes 2 equiv Mn(II) present active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
