 purpose study investigate acute effects all-out 100-m swimming sprint changes serum enzyme calcium ion concentrations young (12 14 years) male female swimmers. Changes serum enzyme concentrations creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), serum glucose (GL), calcium ion ((Ca2+) concentrations measured 23 elite swimmers (13 boys 10 girls) 100-m freestyle all-out sprint. Analysis showed (1) significant sex differences serum CK concentration baseline (Pretest); (2) significant sex differences serum CK LDH concentrations 100-m spring; (3) significant differences Ca2+ concentration 100-m spring; (4) significant increase Serum GOT blood glucose concentrations 100-m sprint, suggesting might useful indicators anaerobic exercise stress young swimmers.
