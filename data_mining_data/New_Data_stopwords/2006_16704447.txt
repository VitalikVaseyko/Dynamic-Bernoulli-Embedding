 Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency common enzyme defect affecting glycolytic pathway erythrocyte. Usually, clinically silent heterozygotes serious disorders described birth homozygotes compound heterozygotes. Including mutants herein reported, 180 mutations PK-LR gene identified. 3-year study carried detect mutations associated disease-affecting families. Haematological indices, erythrocyte PK glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities measured. Molecular characterisation PK gene mutations included restriction enzyme analysis, mutation scanning gene sequencing. Among 56 families studied, nine homozygous cases 41 different mutations found. Eight mutations involved splice site, 31 missense mutations located crucial domains molecule (catalytic site, cleft C domains, A/A' interface) two cases insertion-deletion found. total, 20 new mutations modifying structure enzyme seven affecting splice site reported. PK deficiency diagnosed disease. However, deficiency could life threatening perinatal period report two lethal cases. results support characterisation PK mutations, show prenatal diagnosis identify affected infants prepare safer conditions birth.
