 Xenopus nuclear factor 7 (xnf7) nuclear phosphoprotein encoded member novel zinc finger gene family likely functions transcription factor. possesses nuclear localization signal (NLS) similar bipartite basic NLS nucleoplasmin, unlike nucleoplasmin, re-enters nuclei immediately fertilization, xnf7 remains cytoplasmic mid-blastula transition (MBT). measured accumulation injected labeled xnf7 protein protein produced synthetic xnf7 transcripts oocyte nuclei (GV). data show NLS xnf7 functions efficiently oocytes. Mutations either bipartite basic domains xnf7 NLS inhibit nuclear accumulation, mutations spacer sequences effect. xnf7 NLS linked pyruvate kinase directs efficient accumulation protein nuclei early embryos prior MBT. data suggest retention xnf7 protein development result mechanism interferes xnf7 NLS function.
