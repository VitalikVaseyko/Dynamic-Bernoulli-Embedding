 Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) glycolysis two main pathways control energy metabolism cell. Warburg effect, glycolysis remains active even aerobic conditions, considered key driver cancer cell proliferation, malignancy, metastasis, therapeutic resistance. target aerobic glycolysis, exploited complementary roles OXPHOS glycolysis ATP synthesis basis chemical genetic screen, enabling rapid identification novel small-molecule inhibitors facilitative glucose transport. Blocking mitochondrial electron transport antimycin leucascandrolide little effect highly glycolytic A549 lung carcinoma cells, adding known glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose, iodoacetate cytochalasin B, rapidly depleted intracellular ATP, displaying chemical synthetic lethality. Based principle, exposed antimycin A-treated A549 cells newly synthesized 955 member diverse scaffold small-molecule library, screening compounds rapidly depleted ATP levels. Two compounds potently suppressed ATP synthesis, induced G1 cell-cycle arrest inhibited lactate production. Pathway analysis revealed novel probes inhibited GLUT family facilitative transmembrane transporters but, unlike cytochalasin B, effect actin cytoskeleton. work illustrated utility pairwise chemical genetic screen discovery novel chemical probes, would useful study system-level organization energy metabolism could also facilitate development drugs targeting upregulation aerobic glycolysis cancer.
