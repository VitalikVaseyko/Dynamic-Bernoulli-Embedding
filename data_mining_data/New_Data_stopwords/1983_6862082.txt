 1. Studies pyruvate kinase immobilized via -S-S- linkages showed single subunits tetrameric enzyme inactive. 2. Pyruvate kinase coupled different preparations CNBr-activated Sepharose via one one bond, removal non-covalently bound subunits denaturant treatment subunit derivatives obtained composed different pyruvate kinase species. 3. Heat inactivation studies immobilized enzyme derivatives suggested tetramers pyruvate kinase active. 4. idea supported experiments 2 urea dissociation immobilized tetrameric enzyme carried presence Mg2+ ions.
