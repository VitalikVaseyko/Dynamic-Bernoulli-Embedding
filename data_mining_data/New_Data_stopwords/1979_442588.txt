 Activity M2-pyruvate kinase medullar layer rabbit kidney studied diabetes, starvation within 1 day 10-16 days long-term starvation rabbits administration glucose hydrocortisone protamine-Zn-insulin. enzymatic activity increased diabetes decreased long-term starvation administration insulin. correlation observed low activity pyruvate kinase kidney medulla conditions long-term starvation rabbits deficiency enzyme substrate. data, obtained study enzymatic activity kidney medulla compared rabbit kidney cortex, demonstrate various adaptability cells kidney layers regulatory effects hormones pyruvate kinase activity.
