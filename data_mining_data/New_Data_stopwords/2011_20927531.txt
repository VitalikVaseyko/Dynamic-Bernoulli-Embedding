 Aerobic glycolysis increases tumor cells pyruvate kinase (PK) one key enzymes involved; PK exists different isoforms various tissues. Tumor M2-PK (TM2-PK) one isoforms expression observed various tumor cells, including lymphocytes, lymphoproliferative disorders. present study aimed compare plasma levels TM2-PK serum levels two established markers various lymphoproliferative disorders-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) beta-2 microglobulin, evaluate role TM2-PK drug monitorization disease activity mycosis fungoides (MF) patients. study included 27 MF patients 46 healthy controls. Among MF patients, 18 stage IA, 6 stage IB, 1 stage IIA, 2 stage III. Plasma TM2-PK, serum LDH beta-2 microglobulin levels patients controls measured using ELISA technique, kinetic method, chemiluminescent assay, respectively. Measurements repeated patient group posttreatment. Median levels TM2-PK, LDH, beta-2 microglobulin level MF patients 22 U mL(-)(1), 375 U L(-)(1), 1,831 ng mL(-)(1), respectively. TM2-PK beta-2 microglobulin levels significantly differ MF patients controls; however, LDH levels significantly higher MF patients. TM2-PK levels 17 MF patients remission significantly differ pre-therapy levels. Based cut-off point 17.5 U mL(-)(1), sensitivity specificity TM2-PK diagnosing MF 55.6 60.9%, respectively. beta-2 microglobulin sensitive marker diagnosing MF (63%), LDH specific marker. Furthermore, sensitivity TM2-PK increased analyzed combination parallel tests LDH beta-2 microglobulin (86%), specificity measured 32%. serial analysis, specificity increased 98%, sensitivity 5%. Statistically significant agreement diagnosing MF also noted TM2-PK LDH levels. TM2-PK may useful marker MF, especially early-stage patients, proliferates slowly. think TM2-PK levels investigated advanced-stage MF types cutaneous T-cell lymphomas; particular, combination established markers.
