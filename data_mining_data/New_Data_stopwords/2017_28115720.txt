 L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) emerged putative oncometabolite capable inhibiting enzymes involved metabolism, chromatin modification, cell differentiation. However, despite ability L-2HG interfere broad range cellular processes, molecule often characterized metabolic waste product. Here, demonstrate Drosophila larvae use metabolic conditions established aerobic glycolysis synthesize accumulate high concentrations L-2HG normal developmental growth. majority larval L-2HG pool derived glucose dependent Drosophila estrogen-related receptor (dERR), promotes L-2HG synthesis up-regulating expression Drosophila homolog lactate dehydrogenase (dLdh). also show dLDH necessary sufficient directly synthesizing L-2HG Drosophila homolog L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (dL2HGDH), encodes enzyme breaks L-2HG, required stage-specific degradation L-2HG pool. addition, dLDH also indirectly promotes L-2HG accumulation via synthesis lactate, activates metabolic feed-forward mechanism inhibits dL2HGDH activity stabilizes L-2HG levels. Finally, use genetic approach demonstrate dLDH L-2HG influence position effect variegation DNA methylation, suggesting compound serves coordinate glycolytic flux epigenetic modifications. Overall, studies demonstrate growing animal tissues synthesize L-2HG controlled manner, reveal mechanism coordinates glucose catabolism L-2HG synthesis, establish fly unique model system studying endogenous functions L-2HG cell growth proliferation.
