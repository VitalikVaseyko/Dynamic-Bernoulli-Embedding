 Histochemical analysis five muscles water monitor, Varanus salvator, identified three major classes fibers based histochemical activities enzymes myosin ATPase (mATPase), succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPDH). Fast-twitch, glycolytic (FG) fibers abundant fiber type exhibited following reaction product intensities: mATPase, dark; SDH, light; alpha GPDH, moderate dark. Fast-twitch, oxidative, glycolytic (FOG) fibers characteristically mATPase, dark; SDH, light; alpha GPDH, moderate dark. third class fibers following histochemical characteristics: mATPase, light; SDH, moderate dark; alpha GPDH, light. fibers considered either slow twitch, tonic, oxidative (S/O). Pyruvate kinase (PK), alpha GPDH, citrate synthase (CS) activities measured homogenates muscles studied histochemically. positive relationship PK alpha GPDH activities percentage glycolytic fiber types within muscle. Likewise, CS activities greater muscles high FOG S/O content. Based CS activities, Varanus S/O fibers eight-fold oxidative FG fibers within muscle. PK/CS ratios suggested FG fibers possess high anaerobic capacity, similar iguanid lizard Dipsosaurus. fiber type composition gastrocnemius muscle, relative lizard species, suggests varanid lizards may possess greater proportion FOG S/O fibers lizards.
