 developmental senescent patterns number heart enzyme activities linked energy metabolism studied rats aged 4 days 21 months. morphometric study mitochondrial volume fractions numbers also carried out. Developmental changes result rise mitochondrial enzymes (NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase) mitochondrial volume fractions. Exceptions NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase, declines 4 days onwards, NAD+-malate dehydrogenase, declines rises period. Senescent changes follow two different trends. pyruvate kinase mitochondrial enzymes lying citrate formation isocitrate oxidation (citrate synthase, NADP+-and NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenases) decline degree, mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase NAD+-malate dehydrogenase activities increase period. could point towards partial impairment Krebs cycle function, reduced energy-producing capacity aged rat heart.
