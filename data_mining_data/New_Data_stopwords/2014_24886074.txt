 BACKGROUND: malignant tumour, cancer cells embedded stromal cells, namely cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs accepted important players cancer dynamics, involved tumour growth progression. Although various reports interaction tumour stromal cells, clinico-pathological significance cross-talk still largely unknown. study, aimed characterise expression key metabolic proteins involved glucose transport, pyruvate/lactate shuttle system, glycolytic metabolism fatty acid oxidation CAFs tumour cells different stages malignant transformation. aimed contextualise clinico-pathological significance protein expression profiles reference known prognostic indicators, including biochemical recurrence pT stage. METHODS: Prostate tissues obtained 480 patients median age 64 years following radical prostatectomy previous hormonal therapy. Tissues analysed expression several key metabolism-related proteins glands surrounding fibroblasts immunohistochemistry. Reliable markers prognosis pT stage biochemical recurrence assessed case. RESULTS: observed prostate cancer cells rely mainly glycolytic metabolism, high expression MCT4 CAIX - CAFs. corroborates hypothesis "Reverse Warburg effect" prostate cancer, fibroblasts oxidative stress express CAIX, established hypoxia marker. found alterations expression metabolism-related proteins already evident early stages malignant transformation, suggesting continuing alteration CAFs early stage. Additionally, first time, show cases showing high MCT4 expression CAFs concomitant strong MCT1 expression prostate cancer (PCa) cells associated poor clinical outcome, namely pT3 stage tumour. CONCLUSIONS: summary, work demonstrates first time clinico-pathological significance lactate shuttle prostate cancer. also suggests alterations CAFs may useful prognostic factors, supports use MCT1/MCT4 targets PCa therapy.
