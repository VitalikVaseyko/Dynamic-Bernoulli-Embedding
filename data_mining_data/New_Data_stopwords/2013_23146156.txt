 Knowledge gene expression animals involved abnormal behaviors contribute understanding underlying biological mechanisms. study aimed explore motivational background tail biting, abnormal injurious behavior severe welfare problem pig production. Affymetrix microarrays used investigate gene expression differences hypothalamus prefrontal cortex pigs performing tail biting, pigs receiving bites tail neutral pigs involved behavior. hypothalamus, 32 transcripts differentially expressed (P < 0.05) tail biters compared neutral pigs, 130 comparing receiver pigs neutrals, two tail biters compared receivers. prefrontal cortex, seven transcripts differently expressed tail biters compared neutrals, seven receivers vs. neutrals none tail biters vs. receivers. total, 19 genes showed different expression pattern neutral pigs compared performers receivers. implies functions may provide knowledge neutral pigs involved tail biting behavior performers receivers. Among 19 transcripts genes associated production traits pigs (PDK4), sociality humans mice (GTF2I) novelty seeking humans (EGF). line hypotheses linking tail biting reduced back fat thickness explorative behavior.
