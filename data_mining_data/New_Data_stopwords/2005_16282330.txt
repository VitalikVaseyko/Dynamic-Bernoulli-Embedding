 Cholesterol homeostasis mammals involves pathways biosynthesis, cellular uptake, hepatic conversion bile acids. Key genes three pathways regulated negative feedback control. Uptake biosynthesis directly regulated cholesterol inhibition proteolytic activation sterol regulatory element binding proteins. conversion cholesterol bile acids liver regulated bile acid-dependent induction negatively acting small heterodimer partner nuclear receptor. report, shown small heterodimer partner also directly regulates cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase effect low density lipoprotein receptor expression. significant metabolic significance, provides mechanism independently regulate cholesterol synthesis uptake (an essential regulatory feature known occur vivo) pathway direct regulation cholesterol biosynthesis bile acids. latter feature ensures early phase bile acid synthesis (pre-cholesterol) metabolic communication later stages pathway properly regulate whole pathway flux. highlights important regulatory feature shared key branched, multienzyme pathways, glycolysis, pathway outflow pyruvate kinase regulated concentration key early intermediate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
