 overactivation immune cells plays important role pathogenesis hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis. Homocysteine (Hcy) activates B cell proliferation Ab secretion; however, underlying mechanisms effects remain largely unknown. Metabolic reprogramming critical lymphocyte activation effector function. study, showed Hcy-activated B cells displayed increase oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, tendency shift toward latter, well accumulation intermediates pentose phosphate pathway, provide energy biosynthetic substrates cell growth function. Mechanistically, Hcy increased protein expression glycolytic enzyme activity pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) B cells, whereas PKM2 inhibitor shikonin restored Hcy-induced metabolic changes, well B cell proliferation Ab secretion vivo vitro, indicating PKM2 plays critical role metabolic reprogramming Hcy-activated B cells. investigation revealed Akt-mechanistic target rapamycin signaling pathway involved process, mechanistic target rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin inhibited Hcy-induced changes PKM2 enzyme activity B cell activation. Notably, shikonin treatment effectively attenuated HHcy-accelerated atherosclerotic lesion formation apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. conclusion, results demonstrate PKM2 required support metabolic reprogramming Hcy-induced B cell activation function, might serve critical regulator HHcy-accelerated initiation atherosclerosis.
