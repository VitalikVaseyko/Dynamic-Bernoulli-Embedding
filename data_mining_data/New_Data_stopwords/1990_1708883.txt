 exhaustive structural comparisons, found one-third alpha-helix-turn-beta-strand polypeptides alpha-beta barrel domains share common structural motif. chief characteristics motif first, geometry turn alpha-helix beta-strand somewhat constrained, second, beta-strand contains hydrophobic patch fits hydrophobic pocket alpha-helix. geometry turn seem major determinant alpha-beta unit, turns vary length four six residues. However, motif occur constraints geometry turn-for instance, turns alpha-helix beta-strands long. also occurs much less frequently flat-sheet alpha-beta proteins, topology much less regular amount twist sheet varies considerably barrel proteins. motif may one basic building blocks alpha-beta barrels constructed.
