 Plasma levels glutamate, alanine, free fatty acids (FFA), citrate, glucose, insulin, lactate, creatine kinase aspartate aminotransferase determined frequently first 2-48 h onset chest pain 10 patients developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 8 (non-AMI). initial decrease plasma glutamate increase alanine found AMI compared non-AMI patients. AMI group showed early, moderate rises plasma FFA citrate concentrations, positively related initial ST-segment elevation enzymatic estimated infarct size. AMI patients continuously hyperglycaemic, relative insulin response i.e. plasma glucose/insulin ratio identical non-AMI patients. Lactate values differ two groups. Via participation malate-aspartate shuttle shunting pyruvate alanine instead lactate, glutamate importance maintaining myocardial glucose utilization. finding initial low plasma glutamate concentrations onset myocardial infarction suggests insufficient glutamate supply ischaemic myocardium. basis animal experiments, external supply glutamate might 'metabolic' treatment AMI, alternative additional glucose-insulin-potassium infusion order promote myocardial glucose oxidation.
