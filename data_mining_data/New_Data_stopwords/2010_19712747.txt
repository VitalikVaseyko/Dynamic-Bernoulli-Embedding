 Little known metabolic profile lung tumors reminiscence embryonic features. Herein, determined bioenergetic profiles human fibroblasts taken lung epidermoid carcinoma (HLF-a) fetal lung (MRC5). also analysed human lung tumors surrounding healthy tissue four patients adenocarcinoma. different models, measured functional parameters (cell growth rates oxidative glycolytic media, respiration, ATP synthesis PDH activity) well compositional features (expression level various energy proteins upstream transcription factors). results demonstrate lung fetal cancer cell lines produced ATP predominantly glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation capable poor ATP delivery. explained decreased mitochondrial biogenesis caused lowered expression PGC1alpha (as shown RT-PCR Western blot) mtTFA. Consequently, relative expression glycolytic versus OXPHOS markers high cells. Moreover, re-activation mitochondrial biogenesis resveratrol induced cell death specifically cancer cells. consistent reduction mitochondrial biogenesis subsequent alteration respiratory capacity also observed lung tumors, associated lower expression level bcl2. data give better characterization lung cancer cells' metabolic alterations essential growth survival. designate mitochondrial biogenesis possible target anti-cancer therapy.
