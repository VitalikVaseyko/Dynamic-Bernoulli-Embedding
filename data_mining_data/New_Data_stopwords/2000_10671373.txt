 hypothesis glucose transporter GLUT2 function protein mediating transcriptional glucose signaling addressed. divert putative interacting proteins glucose signaling pathway, two intracytoplasmic domains GLUT2, C terminus large loop located transmembrane domains 6 7, transfected mhAT3F hepatoma cells. Glucose-induced accumulation two hepatic gene mRNAs (GLUT2 L-pyruvate kinase) specifically inhibited cells transfected GLUT2 loop GLUT2 C terminus. dual effects glucose dissociated cells expressing GLUT2 loop; fact normal glucose metabolism glycogen occurred concomitantly inhibition glucose-induced transcription. inhibition GLUT2 loop could due competitive binding protein normally interacts endogenous GLUT2. addition, GLUT2 loop, tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP), located within nucleus, whereas GFP GFP-GLUT2 C-terminal proteins remained cytoplasm. living cells, fraction (50%) expressed GFP-GLUT2 loop translocated rapidly cytoplasm nucleus response high glucose concentration conversely absence glucose. conclude that, via protein interactions large loop, GLUT2 may transduce glucose signal plasma membrane nucleus.
