 Cre-loxP system useful tool study physiological effects gene knockout heart. One limitation using system heart toxic effect chronic expression Cre recombinase. circumvent limitation, widely used inducible cardiac-specific model, Myh6-MerCreMer (Cre), using tamoxifen (TAM) activate Cre developed. current study examined cardiac function Cre-positive C57B/J6 mice exposed one, three, five daily doses 40 mg/kg TAM induce Cre activity specifically heart. Echocardiography demonstrated statistically significant differences systolic function (SF) baseline assessed fractional shortening. mice exposed five injections, significant fall determinants SF observed 6 days TAM initiated. However, SF returned baseline levels 10 days TAM initiation although hearts exhibited significant hypertrophy. Heart weight-to-tibia length ratios 73 +/- 3, 78.5 +/- 6, 87.6 +/- 9 mg/cm one, three, five TAM injections, respectively. TAM effect cardiac function hypertrophy Cre-negative mice. Cre-positive mice receiving five TAM injections significant reductions cardiac mitochondrial ATP significant reductions expression proteins important regulation cardiac oxidative phosphorylation including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4. Thus inducible cardiac-specific activation Cre recombinase caused transient decline SF dependent number TAM doses associated significant hypertrophy alterations mitochondrial ATP important proteins involved regulation cardiac oxidative phosphorylation.
