 Addition insulin (10(-8)M) hepatocytes, incubated either absence presence suboptimal concentration glucagon, caused reactivation pyruvate kinase simultaneously provoked transient stimulation pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity (40-70% control values). stimulatory effect insulin pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity dose-dependent (ED50 = 1 2 X 10(-11)M) persisted Sephadex G-25 filtration ammonium sulfate precipitation hepatocytes extracts. results demonstrate insulin exerts short-term regulation hepatic pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity.
