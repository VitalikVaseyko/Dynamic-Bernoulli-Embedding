 activity kinetic parameters key enzymes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis amino acid catabolism liver male female mink determined compared corresponding activities rat cat. activities glucose-6-phosphatase pyruvate kinase dependent sex, higher females. Except pyruvate carboxylase glycolytic gluconeogenic enzyme activities mink higher rat cat; especially activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucose-6-phosphatase markedly higher. activities glutamate dehydrogenase glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase smaller corresponding activities rat higher cat. results suggest mink high capacity gluconeogenesis compared rat.
