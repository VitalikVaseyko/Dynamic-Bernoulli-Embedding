 O2-mediated alterations cell energy metabolism may play role structural functional abnormalities described type II pneumocytes (T-II-P) following vivo hyperoxia. Bioenergetic alterations produced hyperoxia (95% O2) therefore examined culture-maintained cell line derived T-II-P. Exposure cell monolayers 95% O2 96 h results significant decrease O2 consumption (from 0.52 +/- 0.07 0.30 +/- 0.08, P less 0.01), suggesting impaired mitochondrial energy provision. addition, increased rates aerobic lactate production (from 2.89 +/- 0.52 3.84 +/-0.80, P less 0.05) loss Pasteur effect, indicating shift glycolytic metabolism relatively high PO2's. metabolic changes accompanied altered activities critical mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase) glycolytic (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase) enzymes. Altered cell bioenergetics following hyperoxia may represent important secondary mechanism leading functional abnormalities T-II-P.
