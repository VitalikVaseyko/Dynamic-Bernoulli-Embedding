 Bovine serum albumin, pyruvate kinase, hemoglobin, Fc fragment IgG labeled introduced HeLa cells erythrocyte-mediated microinjection. Degradation injected proteins measured cells cultured temperatures 6 degrees C 37 degrees C. Arrhenius plots revealed constant Ea 27 +/- 5 kcal/mol temperature interval. Similarly, apparent Ea degradation long-term endogenously labeled HeLa proteins 22-26 kcal/mol. local protein unfolding proteolysis defined enzymes, trypsin papain, proceed EaS 5 15 kcal/mol. 2-fold higher values obtained study indicate protein unfolding simple proteolysis rate limiting degradation injected long-lived endogenous HeLa proteins. Moreover, relatively uniform EaS suggest similar biochemical event rate limiting degradation specific protein independent half-life. event may involve reaction ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway rabbit reticulocyte lysates observed EaS ATP-dependent proteolysis system also 27 +/- 5 kcal/mol.
