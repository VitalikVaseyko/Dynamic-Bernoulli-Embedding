 Although Human Genome Project raised much hope identification druggable genetic targets cancer diseases, genetic target-based approach improved productivity drug discovery traditional approach. Analyses known human target proteins currently marketed drugs reveal drugs target limited number proteins compared whole proteome. contrast genome-based targets, mechanistic targets derived empirical research, cellular molecular levels, disease models and/or patients, thereby enabling exploration greater number druggable targets beyond genome epigenome. paradigm shift made tremendous headway developing new therapeutic agents targeting different clinically relevant mechanisms/pathways cancer cells. Prospects article, provide overview potential drug targets related following four emerging areas: (1) tumor metabolism (the Warburg effect), (2) dysregulated protein turnover (E3 ubiquitin ligases), (3) protein-protein interactions, (4) unique DNA high-order structures protein-DNA interactions. Nonetheless, considering genetic phenotypic heterogeneities characterize cancer cells, development drug resistance cancer cells adapting signaling circuitry take advantage redundant pathways feedback/crosstalk systems possible. "phenotypic adaptation" underlies rationale using therapeutic combinations targeted agents cytotoxic drugs.
