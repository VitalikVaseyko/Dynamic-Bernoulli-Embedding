 Increased aerobic glycolysis recognized feature multiple cellular phenotypes offers potential point drug interference, pursued anti-tumor agents targeting Warburg effect. study aimed examining role aerobic glycolysis migration vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) susceptibility small molecule indirubin-3'-monoxime (I3MO). Activation VSMC platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted migration increased glycolytic activity accompanied increased glucose uptake hexokinase (HK) 2 expression. Inhibition glycolysis hexokinase pharmacological agents siRNA-mediated knockdown significantly reduced migratory behavior VSMC without affecting cell viability early actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. I3MO, previously recognized inhibitor VSMC migration, able counteract PDGF-activated increase glycolysis HK2 abundance. Activation signal transducer activator transcription (STAT) 3 could identified crucial event upregulation HK2 glycolytic activity PDGF-stimulated VSMC point interference I3MO. I3MO inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha-dependent transcription influence miRNA 143 levels, potential regulators HK2 levels. Overall, demonstrate increased aerobic glycolysis important factor motility activated VSMC anti-migratory property I3MO may partly depend impairment glycolysis via compromised STAT3/HK2 signaling axis.
