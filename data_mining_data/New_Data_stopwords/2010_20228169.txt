 Lipodystrophy high nonesterified fatty acid (FA) efflux reported humans receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treat HIV infection. Ritonavir, common component HAART, alters adipocyte FA efflux, mechanism effect established. investigate ritonavir-induced changes FA flux recycling acylglycerols, exposed differentiated murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes ritonavir 14 d. FA efflux, uptake, incorporation acylglycerols measured. identify mediator FA efflux, measured adipocyte triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL) transcript protein. determine whether ritonavir-treated adipocytes increased glycerol backbone synthesis FA reesterification, measured labeled glycerol pyruvate incorporation triacylglycerol (TAG). Ritonavir-treated cells increased FA efflux, uptake, incorporation TAG (all P < 0.01). Ritonavir increased FA efflux without consistently increasing glycerol release changing TAG mass, suggesting increased partial TAG hydrolysis. Ritonavir-treated adipocytes expressed significantly ATGL mRNA (P < 0.05) protein (P < 0.05). Ritonavir increased glycerol (P < 0.01) pyruvate (P = 0.41), utilization TAG backbone synthesis. Consistent substrate utilization, glycerol kinase transcript (required glycerol incorporation TAG backbone) up-regulated (P < 0.01), whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase transcript (required pyruvate utilization) down-regulated (P < 0.001). 3T3-L1 adipocytes, long-term ritonavir exposure perturbs FA metabolism increasing ATGL-mediated partial TAG hydrolysis, thus increasing FA efflux, leads compensatory increases FA reesterification glycerol acylglycerols. changes FA metabolism may, part, explain increased FA efflux observed ritonavir-associated lipodystrophy.
