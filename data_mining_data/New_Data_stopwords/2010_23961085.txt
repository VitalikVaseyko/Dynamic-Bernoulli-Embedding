 study conducted determine effect different stress factors physiological measurements Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). total number 160 Nile tilapia, body weight ranging 100 120 g, exposed three stress factors hypoxia, overcrowding starvation different periods 24, 72 144 h. results cortisol level 134.15, 144.27, 154.12 ng/ml 140.18 ng/ml control, hypoxia, overcrowding starvation, respectively, 144 h show significant difference among treatments compared control group. contrast, values T3 T4 observed reduction significant difference T3 ranged highest value 122.12 ng/ml control group lowest value starvation group 94.35, 93.81 88.46 ng/ml 24, 72 144 h. Also, similar trend results observed T4 blood glucose among treatments. enzymatic activity lactate dehydrogenise (LDH) increased hypoxic group, significant reduction appeared overcrowding starved fish compared control group. pyruvate kinase (PK) activity decreased hypoxic group increased group.
