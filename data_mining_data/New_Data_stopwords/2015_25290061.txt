 Exogenous ketone bodies (KBs), acetoacetate (AA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) act alternative energy substrates neural cells starvation. present study examined endogenous ketogenic capacity astroglia hypoxia with/without glucose possible roles KBs neuronal energy metabolism. Cultured neurons astroglia prepared Sprague-Dawley rats. Palmitic acid (PAL) l-carnitine (LC) added assay medium. 4- 24-hr production AA BHB measured using cyclic thio-NADH method. (14)C-labeled acid-soluble products (KBs) (14)CO2 produced [1-(14)C]PAL also measured. l-[U-(14)C]lactic acid ([(14)C]LAC), [1-(14)C]pyruvic acid ([(14)C]PYR), beta-[1-(14)C]hydroxybutyric acid ([(14)C]BHB) used compare oxidative metabolism glycolysis end products KBs. cells placed hypoxic chamber (1% O2). PAL LC induced higher production KBs astroglia neurons, CO2 production PAL less 5% KB production astroglia neurons. KB production astroglia augmented AMP-activated protein kinase activators, AICAR metformin, well hypoxia with/without glucose. Neuronal KB production increased hypoxia absence PAL LC. neurons, [(14)C]LAC [(14)C]PYR oxidation decreased 24 hr hypoxia, [(14)C]BHB oxidation preserved. Astroglia responds ischemia vitro enhancing KB production, astroglia-produced KBs derived fatty acid might serve neuronal energy substrate tricarboxylic acid cycle instead lactate, pyruvate dehydrogenase susceptible ischemia.
