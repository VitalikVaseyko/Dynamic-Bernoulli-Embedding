 1. Yeast pyruvate kinase purified near homogeneity subjected chemical modification trinitrobenzenesulfonate P1, P2-bis (5' pyridoxal) diphosphate. 2. Labeled peptides isolated amino acid composition determined. 3. results suggest yeast pyruvate kinase essential lysine residue, residue location equivalent essential lysine described muscle enzyme. 4. Protection experiments indicate lysine located nucleotide binding site.
