 Glucose glutamine abundant nutrients required cell growth, yet cells sense adapt changes levels well understood. MondoA transcription factor forms heterocomplex obligate partner Mlx regulate approximately 75% glucose-dependent transcription. mediating glucose-induced activation thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), MondoA:Mlx complexes directly repress glucose uptake. show glutamine inhibits transcriptional activation TXNIP triggering recruitment histone deacetylase-dependent corepressor amino terminus MondoA. Therefore, presence glucose glutamine, TXNIP expression low, favors glucose uptake aerobic glycolysis; Warburg effect. Consistent MondoA functioning upstream TXNIP, MondoA knockdown reduces TXNIP expression, elevates glucose uptake stimulates cell proliferation. Although glutamine many intracellular fates, cell permeable analog tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediate, alpha-ketoglutarate, also blocks transcriptional activity MondoA TXNIP promoter stimulates glucose uptake. Together data suggest glutamine-dependent mitochondrial anapleurosis dictates glucose uptake aerobic glycolysis blocking MondoA:Mlx-dependent transcriptional activation TXNIP. propose previously unappreciated coordination glutamine glucose utilization defines metabolic checkpoint restricts cell growth subthreshold levels essential nutrients available.
