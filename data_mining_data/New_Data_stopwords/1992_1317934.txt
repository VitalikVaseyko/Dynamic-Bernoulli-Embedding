 effects two representative sulfonylureas, tolbutamide glyburide, pyruvate kinase (PK) flux examined fasted rat hepatocytes. PK flux estimated trapping 14C NaH14CO3 2 mM lactate pool, accounting incomplete trapping parallel incubations L-[1-14C]alanine. Glyburide (20 microM) tolbutamide (1 mM) decreased glucose formation 34.9% 54.8%, respectively, 2 mM lactate. decrease glucose formation associated proportional decrease pyruvate carboxylase (PCOX) flux (32.7% 50.5%, respectively). conditions, net change PK flux observed. hepatocytes preincubated lactate and/or sulfonylurea addition 30 min prior radiolabeling NaH14CO3, metabolic state cells changed markedly. Glyburide produced 34.6% decrease glucose formation 31.3% decrease PCOX flux, change PK flux. contrast, tolbutamide decreased glucose formation 12.5% increased PK flux 53.2%, change PCOX flux observed. increase PK flux may linked tolbutamide-mediated increases fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16P) via fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26P). findings demonstrate tolbutamide glyburide decrease hepatic glucose production various alterations carbohydrate metabolism, depending upon metabolic state cell. addition, F26P may play larger role hypoglycemic mechanism action tolbutamide glyburide, since pyruvate carboxylase accounted decrease glucose formation observed glyburide preincubation tolbutamide resulted activation PK.
