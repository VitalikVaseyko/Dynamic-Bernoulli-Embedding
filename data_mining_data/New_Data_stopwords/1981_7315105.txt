 still unexplained occurrence hemolytic anemia cases alcoholic liver disease prompted us study toxic effect ethanol membrane metabolic properties erythrocytes (RBC) chronic alcoholics (n = 7). Raised susceptibility RBC hydrogen peroxide significantly increased fluidity membrane lipids obtained signaling oxidative metabolic stress. twofold reduction ATP GSH initiated oxidation cellular sulfhydryl groups thus impairing enzyme kinetics pyruvate kinase (PK). Yet heat stability PK markedly reduced fractions containing older RBC. results indicate ethanol-induced acquired PK instability may triggered dialyzable hence non-protein-bound compound, detectable experimental procedures owing low molecular weight. Thus conceivable hemolytic implication ethanol alcoholic liver disease may due abnormal membrane fluidity metabolic disorder finally involving PK-control mechanism.
