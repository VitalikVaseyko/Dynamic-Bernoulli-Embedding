 study undertaken assess effect propane-1,2-diol(PD) ingestion carbohydrate metabolism female rat erythrocytes. purpose, two different groups adult albino female rats treated orally PD two different dose levels 73 294 mg 100 g-1 body wt. blood samples drawn retro-orbital sinus prior treatment served controls, whereas treated samples collected peak periods (1/2 2 h) 2 7 days treatment. single dose PD found elevate levels blood glucose, lactate, pyruvate lactate/pyruvate ratio peak periods (P < 0.001) 2 days (P < 0.001) groups. significant (P < 0.05) increase contents erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) observed peak periods. parameters returned base level 7 days treatment. activities hexokinase (HK), 2,3-diphosphoglycerate phosphatase (2,3-DPG Pase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) aldehyde reductase II (AR II) declined markedly, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK) aldose reductase increased result PD ingestion. changes activities 2,3-DPG Pase LDH persistent 8 days post-treatment. [14C]glucose flux glycolysis hexose monophosphate shunt pathway erythrocytes found lowered (P < 0.001) response PD treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
