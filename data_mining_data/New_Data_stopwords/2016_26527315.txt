 Despite marked tumor shrinkage 5-FU treatment, frequency colon cancer relapse indicates fraction tumor cells survives treatment causing tumor recurrence. majority cancer cells divert metabolites anabolic pathways Warburg behavior giving advantage terms tumor growth. Here, report treatment colon cancer cell 5-FU selects cells mesenchymal stem-like properties undergo metabolic reprogramming resulting addiction OXPHOS meet energy demands. 5-FU treatment-resistant cells show de novo expression pyruvate kinase M1 (PKM1) repression PKM2, correlating repression pentose phosphate pathway, decrease NADPH level antioxidant defenses, promoting PKM2 oxidation acquisition stem-like phenotype. Response 5-FU xenotransplantation model human colon cancer confirms activation mitochondrial function. Combined treatment 5-FU pharmacological inhibitor OXPHOS abolished spherogenic potential colon cancer cells diminished expression stem-like markers. findings suggest inhibition OXPHOS combination 5-FU rational combination strategy achieve durable treatment response colon cancer.
