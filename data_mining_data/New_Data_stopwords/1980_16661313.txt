 synthesis Mg-protoporphyrin-IX exogenous protoporphyrin-IX, crude plastid pellet extracted greening cucumber cotyledons found require l-glutamate cofactor. shown glutamate acts presence contaminating mitochondria provide ATP regenerating system. purified plastids, Mg chelatase stimulated glutamate; instead, requires high concentration ATP greatly stimulated added phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase. GTP, UTP, CTP, ITP substitute ATP. ADP absence ATP generating system completely ineffective, whereas slightly inhibitory presence 10 mm ATP. AMP strongly inhibitory reaction; 50% inhibition obtained approximately 3.5 mm AMP presence 10 mm ATP.
