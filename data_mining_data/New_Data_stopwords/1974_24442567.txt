 effect nitrate incubation pattern carbohydrate metabolism different regions pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Kelvedon Wonder) root studied. Roots incubated 10 mM potassium nitrate solution 4, 8 12 h. Marked increases noted activities nitrate assimilation enzymes 4 h. Increased activities also recorded hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase transketolase. consistent changes observed activities phosphofructokinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Experiments [1-(14)C] [6-(14)C]glucose indicated relative shift pattern carbohydrate oxidation glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway. data interpreted indicating close interrelationship nitrate assimilation carbohydrate metabolism, particularly relation supply NADPH pentose phosphate pathway nitrite reductase.
