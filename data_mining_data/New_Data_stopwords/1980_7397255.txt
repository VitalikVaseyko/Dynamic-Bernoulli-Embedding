 studying enzymic activities successively chosen portions solutions pyruvatekinase, hexokinase, lactatedehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase trypsin fast macroscopic fluctuations revealed. fluctuations found earlier protein preparations actomyosin complex creatinkinase described "conformation fluctuations". Similar macroscopic fluctuations also revealed measuring rate reaction ascorbic acid dichlorphenolindophenol (DCAPI). spectra macroscopic fluctuations solutions different proteins ascorbic acid+DCAPI similar principle. gives grounds consider ability towards macroscopic fluctuations common property solutions different substances.
