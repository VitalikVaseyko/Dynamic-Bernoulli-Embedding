 Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) often associated abnormal mitochondrial open frames (ORF), orfH79 mitochondrial chimeric gene responsible CMS trait Honglian (HL) rice. study, weakly produced ORFH79 protein significantly inhibited growth E. coli oxygen culture, however, growth transformants producing ORFH79 indistinguishable control anaerobic incubation conditions. addition, lower respiration rate, wrinkled bacterial surfaces, decreased pyruvate kinase alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activities observed ORFH79 produced E. coli. results indicate ORFH79 impairs oxygen respiration E. coli, may inhibit E. coli growth.
