 Temperature strong selective force evolution proteins due effects higher orders protein structure and, thereby, critical protein functions like ligand binding catalysis. Comparisons among orthologous proteins differently thermally adapted species show consistent patterns adaptive variation function, studies examined functional adaptation among multiple structural families proteins. Thus, present state knowledge, difficult predict fraction proteome exhibit adaptive variation face temperature increases several degrees Celsius, is, temperature increases magnitude predicted models global warming. Here, compared orthologous enzymes warm-adapted Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis cold-adapted Mytilus trossulus, native North Pacific Ocean, species whose physiologies exhibit significantly different responses temperature. measured effects temperature kinetics (Michaelis-Menten constant-K(m)) five enzymes important ATP generation represent distinct protein structural families. Among phosphoglucomutase (PGM), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (IDH), IDH orthologs showed significantly different thermal responses K(m) two species. K(m) isocitrate M. galloprovincialis-IDH intrinsically lower thermally stable M. trossulus-IDH thus higher substrate affinity high temperatures. Two amino acid substitutions account functional differences IDH orthologs, one allows hydrogen bonds form near mobile region active site M. galloprovincialis-IDH. Taken together, findings cast light targets adaptive evolution context climate change; minority proteins might adapt small changes temperature, adaptations may involve small changes sequence.
