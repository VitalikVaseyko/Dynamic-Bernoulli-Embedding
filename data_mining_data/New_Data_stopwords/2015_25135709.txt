 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), PI3K inhibitor, widely used inhibition autophagy. Inhibition PI3K class leads inhibition Akt phosphorylation, central molecule involved diverse arrays intracellular cascades nervous system. Accordingly, present study, aimed determine alterations specific mitochondrial biogenesis markers mitochondrial function 3-MA-injected rats following amyloid beta (Abeta) insult. data revealed inhibition Akt phosphorylation downregulates master regulator mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha). data also showed decrease PGC-1alpha level presumably due decrease phosphorylation cAMP-response element binding AMP-activated kinase, two upstream activators PGC-1alpha. consequence, level mitochondrial biogenesis factors including nuclear respiratory factor-1, mitochondrial transcription factor A, Cytochrome c decreased significantly. Also, activities tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzymes Aconitase, a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase reduced presence 3-MA without Abeta insult. Decrease mitochondrial biogenesis factors TCA enzyme activity rats receiving 3-MA Abeta compared rats received either alone; indicating additive destructive effects two agents. agreement molecular results, data obtained behavioral test (using novel objective recognition test) indicated inhibition Akt phosphorylation without Abeta injection impaired novel recognition (non-spatial) memory. results suggest 3-MA amplified deleterious effects Abeta targeting central molecule Akt.
