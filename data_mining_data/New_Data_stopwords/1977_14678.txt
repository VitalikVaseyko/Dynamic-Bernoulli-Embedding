 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase irreversibly inactivated upon incubation adenine nucleotide analogue, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. plot time dependence logarithm enzymatic activity given time divided initial enzymatic activity(logE/Eo) reveals biphasic rate inactivation, consistent rapid reaction form partially active enzyme 54% original activity, followed slower reaction yield totally inert enzyme. addition pyruvate kinase activity enzyme, modification 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine also disrupts ability catalyze decarboxylation oxaloacetate ATP-dependent enolization pyruvate. correspondence time dependence inactivation, rate incorporation 5'-p-[14C]fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine also biphasic. Two moles reagent per mole enzyme subunit bound enzyme completely inactive. pseudo-first-order rate constant rapid rate linearly dependent reagent concentration, whereas constant slow rate exhibits saturation kinetics, suggesting reagent binds reversibly second site prior modification. adenosine moiety essential effectiveness 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, since p-fluorosulfonylbenzoic acid inactivate pyruvate kinase significant rate. Thus, reaction 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine pyruvate kinase exhibits several characteristics affinity labeling enzyme. Protection inactivation 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine provided addition incubation mixture phosphoenolpyruvate. Mg-ADP Mg2+. contrast, addition pyruvate, Mg-ATP, ADP ATP alone effect rate inactivation. observations consistent postulate 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine specifically labels amino acid residues binding region Mg2+ phosphoryl group phosphoenolpyruvate transferred catalytic reaction. rate inactivation increases increasing pH, k1 depends unprotonated form amino acid residue pK = 8.5. basis pH dependence reaction pyruvate kinase 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine elimination cysteine residues possible sites reaction, postulated lysyl tyrosyl residues probably candidates critical amino acids.
