 adaptive responses gastrointestinal enzymes, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin diet, folic acid, insulin five obese adult-onset diabetic patients studied 30-day fast. data compared adaptive responses gastrointestinal enzymes diet, folic acid, insulin 15 normal male volunteer subjects, ages 18 24. group testing period received carbohydrate diet (50% calories carbohydrate consisting 1/2 glucose 1/2 fructose) noncarbohydrate diet (70% calories corn oil 30% sodium caseinate) without folic acid (5 mg three times per day). effect insulin studied carbohydrate diet plus folic acid. data demonstrate obese adult-onset diabetic patients impaired adaptive response jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme activities (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1-6-diphosphate aldolase, fructosediphosphatase) dietary carbohydrate, oral folic acid, insulin compared normal subjects nondiabetic obese patients. Following 30-day fast, obese diabetic patients showed improvement glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, adaptive response jejunal carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme activities dietary carbohydrate, folic acid, insulin. greatest improvement adaptive response jejunal enzyme activities occurred carbohydrate diet.
