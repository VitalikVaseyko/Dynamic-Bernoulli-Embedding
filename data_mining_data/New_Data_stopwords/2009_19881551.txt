 cancer cells, glucose often converted lactic acid, known 'Warburg effect'. reason cancer cells higher rate aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, remains largely unclear. Herein, proposed epigenetic mechanism Warburg effect. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 (FBP1), functions antagonize glycolysis downregulated NF-kappaB pathway Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Restoration FBP1 expression suppressed anchorage-independent growth, indicating relevance FBP1 downregulation carcinogenesis. Indeed, FBP1 downregulated gastric carcinomas (P<0.01, n=22) gastric cancer cell lines (57%, 4/7). Restoration FBP1 expression reduced growth glycolysis gastric cancer cells. Moreover, FBP1 downregulation reversed pharmacological demethylation. promoter hypermethylated gastric cancer cell lines (57%, 4/7) gastric carcinomas (33%, 33/101). Inhibition NF-kappaB restored FBP1 expression, partially demethylation FBP1 promoter. Notably, Cox regression analysis revealed FBP1 promoter methylation independent prognosis predicator gastric cancer (hazard ratio: 3.60, P=0.010). summary, found NF-kappaB functions downstream Ras promote epigenetic downregulation FBP1. Promoter methylation FBP1 used new biomarker prognosis prediction gastric cancer. important epigenetic link glycolysis carcinogenesis partly explains Warburg effect.
