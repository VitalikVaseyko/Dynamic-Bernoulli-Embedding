 rat liver cytosol used study protein synthesis per se also study import proteins mitochondria since rat liver cytosol represents environment closer liver mitochondria generally used reticulocytes lysates. Two ATP-regenerating systems compared. creatine phosphate/creatine kinase yields higher protein synthesis phosphoenol pyruvate/pyruvate kinase system. Hemin, necessary maintain synthesis reticulocyte lysates, affect rat liver cytosol. level protein synthesis obtained cell-free system comparable eukaryotic systems described recently expected value "in vivo" conditions. Isolated mitochondria incorporated, standard conditions, newly synthesized proteins linearly 30 min, ceases component(s) cytosol depleted; addition freshly translated cytosol restores import. bulk imported proteins retained mitoplasts mitochondria treatment trypsin. cytosol system useful study questions regulation liver mRNA translation mitochondrial protein turnover.
