 BACKGROUND: aim study assess effect chronic cardiac failure (CCF) circulating plasma concentrations tumour metabolic marker dimeric pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK). METHODS: Fifty patients clinically stable CCF studied. Patients history past ongoing malignancy excluded. Dimeric M2-PK measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay EDTA plasma. RESULTS: Dimeric M2-PK concentration increased significantly (P = 0.005) increasing clinical severity CCF assessed New York Heart Association classification grade. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cardiac failure results increased circulating plasma concentration M2-PK, probably related increased glycolytic flux. physiological significance results present unclear may relate maintaining balance energy production supply glycolytic intermediates maintain synthetic processes. results investigation also significance clinical interpretation M2-PK concentrations.
