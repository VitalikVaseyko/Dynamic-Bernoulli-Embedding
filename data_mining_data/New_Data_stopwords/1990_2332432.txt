 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase chicken liver mitochondria rat liver cytosol catalyzes phosphorylation alpha-substituted carboxylic acids glycolate, thioglycolate, DL-beta-chlorolactate reactions absolute requirements divalent cation activators. 31P NMR analysis reaction products indicates phosphorylation occurs alpha-position generate corresponding O- S-bridged phosphate monoesters. addition, enzymes catalyze bicarbonate-dependent phosphorylation hydroxylamine. chicken liver enzyme also catalyze bicarbonate-dependent phosphorylation hydroxylamine. chicken liver enzyme also catalyzes bicarbonate-dependent phosphorylation fluoride ion. kappa cat values substrates 20-1000-fold slower kappa cat oxaloacetate. Pyruvate beta-hydroxypyruvate phosphorylated, since enzyme catalyze enolization compounds. Oxalate, structural analogue enolate pyruvate, competitive inhibitor phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Ki 5 microM) direction phosphoenolpyruvate formation. Oxalate also inhibitor chicken liver enzyme direction oxaloacetate formation decarboxylation oxaloacetate. chicken liver enzyme inhibited beta-sulfopyruvate, isoelectronic analogue oxaloacetate. extensive homologies reactions catalyzed phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase suggest divalent cation activators reactions may similar functions. substrate specificity indicates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase decarboxylates oxaloacetate form enolate pyruvate phosphorylated MgGTP enzyme.
