 Based pilot study plasma M2-type pyruvate kinase (M2-PyK) diagnosis primary hepatocarcinoma, improvements methodology made. M2-PyK purified directly human placenta, anti-human M2-PyK antibody raised rabbits. purified antibody IgG degraded Fab' fragment cross-linked horseradish peroxidase (HRP) prepare Fab'-HRP conjugate. using sandwich Fab'-ELISA, M2-PyK plasma determined 119 healthy adults, gave values less 2.35 ng/ml, 80 percent less 1.2 ng/ml, medium 0.68ng/ml. significant difference male female subjects. plasma M2-PyK 32 cases primary hepatocarcinoma markedly increased range 1.31-30.13ng/ml 7.06 +/- 5.25 ng/ml, 10 fold normal medium value. 2.35 ng/ml taken upper limit normal range, positive rate 90.6%. Seven cases hepatocarcinoma AFP less 50 ng/ml, M2-PyK positive. result previous report. primary malignant tumors liver origin also positive, whereas benign tumors liver negative. 53 cases carcinomas gastro-intestinal tract, whether carcinomas metastasized liver not, positive rate 40.6-52.3% shown higher cases colorectal carcinoma. Hence, method specific diagnosis primary hepatocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
