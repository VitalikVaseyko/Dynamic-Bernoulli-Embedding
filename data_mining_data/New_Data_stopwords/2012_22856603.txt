 known tumor cells adapt characteristic metabolic phenotypes cancer initiation progression. hallmark tumor metabolism aerobic glycolysis, Warburg Effect, first described 80 years ago. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells produce energy high rate glycolic catabolism lactate cytosol, rather oxidation pyruvate mitochondria, even presence oxygen. Progress past decade revealed alterations oncogenes tumor suppressors responsible metabolic reprogramming cancer cells, however, underlying molecular basis remains largely unknown. Mounting evidence shows interplay microRNAs oncogenes/tumor suppressors, via key metabolic enzyme effecters, could facilitate Warburg Effect cancer cells. review, summarize current understanding roles microRNAs, particular interplay oncogenes/tumor suppressors cMyc, HIF-1 P53, tumor metabolism.
