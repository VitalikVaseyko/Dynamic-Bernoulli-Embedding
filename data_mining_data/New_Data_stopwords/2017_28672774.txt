 BACKGROUND: Chronic hypobaric hypoxia (cHH) mediated cardiac insufficiencies associated pathological damage. Sustained redox stress work load major causative agents cardiac insufficiencies cHH. Despite advancements made pharmacological (anti-oxidants, vasodilators) non-pharmacological therapeutics (acclimatization strategies schedules), partial success achieved improving cardiac acclimatization cHH. necessitates need potent combinatorial therapies improve cardiac acclimatization high altitudes. hypothesize combinatorial therapy comprising preconditioning mild aerobic treadmill exercise supplementation nanocurcumin formulation (NCF) consisting nanocurcumin (NC) pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) might improve cardiac adaptation high altitudes. METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats pre-conditioned treadmill exercise supplemented NCF exposed cHH (7620 altitude corresponding pO2~8% 28+/-2 degrees C, relative humidity 55%+/-1%) 3 weeks. rat hearts analyzed changes markers oxidative stress (free radical leakage, lipid peroxidation, manganese-superoxide dismutase [MnSOD] activity), cardiac injury (circulating cardiac troponin [TnI] [cTnT], myocardial creatine kinase [CK-MB]), metabolic damage (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] acetyl-coenzyme levels, lactate pyruvate levels) bio-energetic insufficiency (ATP, p-AMPKalpha). RESULTS: Significant modulations (p</=0.05) cardiac redox status, metabolic damage, cardiac injury bio-energetics observed rats receiving NCF supplementation treadmill exercise-preconditioning compared rats receiving one treatments. CONCLUSIONS: combinatorial therapeutic strategy showed tremendous improvement cardiac acclimatization cHH compared either exercise-preconditioning NCF supplementation alone evident effective modulation redox, metabolic, contractile bio-energetic homeostasis.
