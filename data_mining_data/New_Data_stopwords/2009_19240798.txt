 BACKGROUND: Otto Warburg observed cancer cells often characterized intense glycolysis presence oxygen concomitant decrease mitochondrial respiration. Research mainly focused possible connection increased glycolysis tumor development whereas decreased respiration largely left unattended. Therefore, causal relation decreased respiration tumorigenesis demonstrated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: purpose, colonies Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suitable manipulation mitochondrial respiration shows mitochondria-mediated cell death, used model. Repression respiration well ROS-scavenging via glutathione inhibited apoptosis conferred survival advantage seeding early development fast proliferating solid cell population. contrast, enhancement respiration triggered cell death. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, Warburg effect might directly contribute initiation cancer formation--not enhanced glycolysis--but also via decreased respiration presence oxygen, suppresses apoptosis.
