 Using immunofluorescence double-labelled antisera L pyruvate kinase (PK), show PK localized hepatocyte cytoplasm. response modulated different dietary hormonal conditions. physiological conditions, L PK noted: slight normal diet (or 35 micrograms glucagon) non-existent starvation (or 350 micrograms glucagon). L PK fluorescence maximal carbohydrate-rich diet. experimental genetic (Zucker rat) hyperinsulinemia, hepatocytes L PK PK positive. partial hepatectomy, double specificity found 48 h 7th day. decrease PK fluorescence starvation glucagon concerns L PK form enzyme. exo- endogenous insulin, increase PK (as insulinemia assays Zucker rats partial hepatectomy confirm) essentially due presence PK hepatocytes.
