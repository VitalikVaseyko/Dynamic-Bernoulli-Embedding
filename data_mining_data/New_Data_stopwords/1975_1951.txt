 Pyruvate kinase ascites tumour cells eluted phosphocellulose low concentrations phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate pyrophosphate, respectively. appropriate limiting conditions "facilitated desorption" enzyme phosphocellulose ligands elaborated achieving maximum selectivity recovery process purification. method designated "affinity elution chromatography" owing specific interactions ligand constituent eluting medium adsorbed enzyme, causes selective desorption ion-exchanger. Affinity elution phosphoenolpyruvate found effective preparation M-types pyruvate kinase. specific activity 420 almost homogeneous preparation pyruvate kinase ascites tumour cells maximally obtained.
