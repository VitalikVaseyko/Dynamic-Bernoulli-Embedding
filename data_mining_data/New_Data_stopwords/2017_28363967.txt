 Pyruvate kinase one three rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes catalyze last step glycolysis, conversion phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate, associated ATP generation. Two isozymes pyruvate kinase, PykF PykA, identified Escherichia coli PykF considered important, whereas PykA less-defined role. Prior studies inactivated pykA gene increase level substrate, PEP, thereby increased yield end products derived PEP. surprised found pykA::Tn5 mutant screen increased yield end product derived pyruvate (n-butanol), suggesting role PykA needs reexamined. show pykA mutant exhibited elevated intracellular ATP levels, biomass concentrations, glucose consumption, n-butanol production. also discovered pykA mutant expresses higher levels presumed pyruvate transporter, YhjX, permitting mutant recapture metabolize excreted pyruvate. Furthermore, demonstrated nucleotide diphosphate kinase activity PykA leads negative regulation intracellular ATP levels. Taking data together, propose inactivation pykA considered general strategy enhance production pyruvate-derived metabolites anaerobic conditions.IMPORTANCE study showed knocking pykA significantly increased intracellular ATP level thus significantly increased levels glucose consumption, biomass formation, pyruvate-derived product formation anaerobic conditions. pykA considered encoding dispensable pyruvate kinase; show pykA negatively regulates anaerobic glycolysis rate regulating energy distribution. Thus, knocking pykA used general strategy increase level pyruvate-derived fermentative products.
