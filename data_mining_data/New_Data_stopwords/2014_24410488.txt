 aging-associated phenotypes may reversible emerging theme contemporary aging research. Gomes et al. report age-associated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects murine skeletal muscle biphasic. first phase, OXPHOS decreased reduced expression mitochondrially encoded genes. Treatment moderately old mice (first-phase OXPHOS defects) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) 1 week restores oxidative phosphorylation activity markers mitochondrial function skeletal muscle. However, muscle strength restored. old animals (second-phase OXPHOS defects), expression OXPHOS genes nucleus mitochondria reduced mitochondrial DNA integrity diminished. Gomes et al. propose model linking decreased NAD(+) loss nuclear SIRT1 activity stabilization hypoxia-associated transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). HIF-1a promotes hypoxic-like (Warburg effect) state cell. HIF-1a protein interacts c-Myc, decreasing c-Myc-regulated transcription key mitochondrial regulator mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM). Low levels TFAM lead first-phase OXPHOS dysfunction. transition irreversible phase 2 dysfunction remains characterized, may related increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. model suggests intervention mitochondrial aging may possible using appropriate NAD(+) precursors nicotinamide riboside. Restoring NAD(+) levels may beneficial throughout organism. example, aging-associated disturbances circadian rhythm linked diminished SIRT1 activity, loss hematopoietic stem cell function reduced SIRT3. Work elucidate biphasic aging mechanisms strongly encouraged.
