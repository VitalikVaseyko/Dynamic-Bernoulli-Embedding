 Aerobic glycolysis essential tumor growth survival. Activation multiple carcinogenic signals contributes metabolism reprogramming malignant transformation cancer. Recently nitric oxide noted promote glycolysis mechanism remains elusive. report dual role nitric oxide glycolysis: low/physiological nitric oxide (</= 100 nM) promotes glycolysis ATP production, oxidative defense cell proliferation ovary cancer cells, whereas excess nitric oxide (>/= 500 nM) inhibits it. Nitric oxide positive effect glycolysis inducing PKM2 nuclear translocation EGFR/ERK2 signaling-dependent manner. Moreover, iNOS induced mild inflammatory stimulation increased glycolysis cell proliferation producing low doses nitric oxide, hyper inflammation induced iNOS inhibited producing excess nitric oxide. Finally, iNOS expression abnormally increased ovarian cancer tissues correlated PKM2 expression. Overexpression iNOS associated aggressive phenotype poor survival outcome ovarian cancer patients. study indicated iNOS/NO play dual role tumor glycolysis progression, established bridge iNOS/NO signaling pathway EGFR/ERK2/PKM2 signaling pathway, suggesting interfering glycolysis targeting iNOS/NO/PKM2 axis may valuable new therapeutic approach treating ovarian cancer.
