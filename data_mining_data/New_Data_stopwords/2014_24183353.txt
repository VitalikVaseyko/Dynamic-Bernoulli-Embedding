 Although morphological anatomical studies indicate varicose veins characterized venous wall weakening subendothelial fibrosis, exact underlying biochemical mechanism development remains unknown. Additionally, quantitative proteomic study venous proteins leading decreased contractility varicose veins reported date. Therefore, elucidate molecular mechanism altered vascular contractility, study performed shotgun proteomic analysis obtain protein expression profiles patients varicose veins. Stable isotope dimethyl labeling coupled nanoLC-MS/MS revealed downregulation 12 polypeptides, including myosin light chain kinase, creatine kinase B-type, ATP synthase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase. However, analyses protein species associated cytoskeletal assembly cellular morphology showed clear up- down-regulation. results indicate defects ATP generation utilization may account dysfunction vascular smooth muscle following formation varicose veins. Collectively, severity varicose veins depends regulatory roles various protein factors metabolic coordination physiological functions. pilot study improves understanding pathogenesis varicose veins lays foundation validation clinical translation biomarkers targeted therapies treating disease.
