 Four mitochondrial protein kinases cloned. proteins represent new family protein kinases, related sequence bacterial protein kinases function eukaryotic serine protein kinases. Arg288 required recognition BCKDK phosphorylation site E1alpha subunit BCKDH complex. BCKDK inhibits dehydrogenase activity BCKDH complex introducing negative charge active-site pocket E1 component. Protein starvation rats induces increase amount BCKDK bound BCKDH complex. causes inactivation BCKDH complex conserves branched-chain amino acids protein synthesis protein-starved state. Expression different PDK isoenzymes tissue specific, different PDK isoenzymes unique respect kinetic parameters ATP ADP sensitivity allosteric effectors (NADH, NAD+, coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, dichloroacetate). Preliminary experiments indicate increased amount PDK2 protein partly explains increase PDK activity occurs rat liver response chemically induced diabetes.
