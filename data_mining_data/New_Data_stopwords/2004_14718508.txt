 Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) likely experience acute changes temperature oxygen availability and, like many organisms, exhibit behavioural selection low temperatures hypoxia acts reduce metabolism alleviate demands heart. investigate whether low temperature protects cardiac performance anoxia, studied effects acute temperature change, 10 degrees C either 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C 18 degrees C, upon performance situ perfused trout hearts before, exposure 20 min anoxia. Routine cardiac workload mimicked vivo conditions given temperatures, effects anoxia evaluated maximal cardiac performance 20 min anoxic perfusion. Functional data related maximal activities glycolytic enzymes energetic status heart termination experiment. high oxygenation, maximum cardiac output power output increased temperature (Q10 values 1.8 2.1, respectively) result increased heart rate. Hypoxia tolerance inversely related temperature. 5 degrees C, hearts maintained routine cardiac output throughout 20 min period anoxia, maximal cardiac performance fully restored following reoxygenation. contrast, cardiac function failed sooner anoxia temperature increased maximal performance reoxygenation reduced 25%, 35% 55% 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C 18 degrees C, respectively. Increased functional impairment following anoxic exposure elevated temperature occurred even though cardiac glycolytic enzyme activity rate lactate production increased proportionally cardiac work. Nonetheless, indication myocardial necrosis, biochemical energetic parameters generally unaffected anoxia.
