 Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers several physical mental symptoms (such irritability) commonly encountered clinical gynaecology. incidence PMS increasing, attracting greater attention medical fields. However, PMS pathogenesis remains unclear. study employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) proteomic map analysis hypothalamus hippocampus rat models premenstrual syndrome (PMS) irritability. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF-MS) used identify proteins possibly related PMS irritability. Baixiangdan, traditional Chinese medicine effective PMS irritability, used rat model study putative target proteins medicine. hypothalamus hippocampus group modelling PMS displayed following features: decreased expression Ulip2, tubulin beta chain 15, alpha actin, interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein; increased expression kappa-B motif-binding phosphoprotein; decreased expression hydrolase end ubiquitin carboxy, albumin, aldolase protein; increased expression M2 pyruvate kinase, panthenol-cytochrome C reductase core protein I, calcium-binding protein. Contrasting previous studies, current study identified new proteins related PMS irritability. findings contribute understanding pathogenesis PMS irritability could provide reference point studies.
