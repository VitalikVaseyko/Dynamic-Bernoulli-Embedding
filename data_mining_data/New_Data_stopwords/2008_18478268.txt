 order enrich hepatocytes differentiated embryonic stem cells, developed novel medium. Since hepatocytes activity ornithine transcarbamylase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, galactokinase, glycerol kinase, expected hepatocytes would enriched medium without arginine, tyrosine, glucose, pyruvate, supplemented ornithine, phenylanaline, galactose, glycerol (hepatocyte-selection medium, HSM). Embryoid bodies transferred onto dishes coated gelatin HSM 4 days culture. 18 days embryoid body formation, single type polygonal cell survived enlarged intercellular space micorvilli. cells positive indocyanine green uptake mRNAs albumin, transthyretin, alpha-feto protein, negative mRNAs tyrosine aminotransferase, alpha1-antitrypsin, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase. Since cells HSM positive cytokeratin (CK)8 CK18 (hepatocyte markers) CK19 (a marker bile duct epithelial cells), concluded hepatoblasts. showed weaker expression CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha fetal liver (18.5 days gestation) expression C/EBPbeta similar level fetal liver. data support conclusion HSM allows selection hepatoblast-like cells.
