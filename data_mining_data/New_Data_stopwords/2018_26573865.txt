 aim study investigate effects phenylalanine oxidative stress metabolic parameters astrocyte cultures newborn Wistar rats. Astrocytes cultured four conditions: control (0.4 mM phenylalanine concentration Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) solution), Phe addition achieve 0.5, 1.0 1.5 mM final phenylalanine concentrations. 72 h astrocytes separated biochemical measurements. Overall measure mitochondrial function 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays indicated phenylalanine induced cell damage three concentrations tested. alteration various parameters oxidative stress indicated phenylalanine able induce free radicals production. Therefore, results strongly suggest Phe concentrations usually found PKU induces oxidative stress consequently cell death astrocytes cultures. Considering importance astrocytes brain function, possible astrocytes alterations may contribute brain damage found PKU patients.
