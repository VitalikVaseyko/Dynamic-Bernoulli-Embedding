 Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall provides semipermeable barrier retain intracellular proteins still permits small molecules pass through. S. cerevisiae cells expressing E. coli lacZ treated detergent extract cell membrane, beta-galactosidase activity permeabilized cells approximately 40% activity protein cell extract. However, permeabilized cells easily collected reused 15 times without appreciable loss activity. Cell wall composition thickness modified using different cell strains enzyme expression mutating genes involved cell wall biosynthesis degradation. Sigma1278b strain cell wall less permeable walls BY4742 W303 cells, deleting EXG1, encodes 1,3-beta-glucanase, reduce permeability. short Zymolyase treatment increase cell wall permeability without rupturing cells. Encapsulating multiple enzymes permeabilized cells offer kinetic advantages enzymes solution. Regeneration ATP AMP adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase encapsulated cell proceeded rapidly regeneration using cell extract. Combining permeabilized cells containing adenylate kinase permeabilized cells containing pyruvate kinase also regenerate ATP AMP, kinetics reaction slower regeneration using cell extract permeabilized cells expressing enzymes.
