 KRAS mutation often present many hard-to-treat tumors colon pancreatic cancer tightly linked serious alterations normal cell metabolism clinical resistance chemotherapy.In 1931, winner Nobel Prize Medicine, Otto Warburg, stated cancer primarily caused altered metabolism interfering energy processing normal cell. Increased cell glycolytic rates even presence oxygen fully recognized hallmark cancer known Warburg effect.In late 1970's, Linus Pauling Ewan Cameron reported vitamin C may positive effects cancer treatment, although deep mechanistic knowledge activity still scarce.We describe novel antitumoral mechanism vitamin C KRAS mutant colorectal cancer involves Warburg metabolic disruption downregulation key metabolic checkpoints KRAS mutant cancer cells tumors without killing human immortalized colonocytes.Vitamin C induces RAS detachment cell membrane inhibiting ERK 1/2 PKM2 phosphorylation. consequence activity, strong downregulation glucose transporter (GLUT-1) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-PTB dependent protein expression observed causing major blockage Warburg effect therefore energetic stress.We propose combination conventional chemotherapy metabolic strategies, including vitamin C and/or molecules targeting pivotal key players involved Warburg effect may constitute new horizon anti-cancer therapies.
