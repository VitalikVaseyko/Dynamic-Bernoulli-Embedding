 Cancer cells site numerous metabolic thermodynamic abnormalities. focus review interactions canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) cancers implications energetic metabolic point view. numerous tissues, PPAR gamma activation induces inhibition beta-catenin pathway, activation canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway inactivates PPAR gamma. cancers all, PPAR gamma downregulated WNT/beta-catenin pathway upregulated. cancer cells, upregulation WNT/beta-catenin signaling induces dramatic changes key metabolic enzymes modify thermodynamic behavior. leads activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDK-1) monocarboxylate lactate transporter. Consequently, phosphorylation PDK-1 inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, large part pyruvate cannot converted acetyl-coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) mitochondria part acetyl-CoA enter tricarboxylic acid cycle. leads aerobic glycolysis spite availability oxygen. phenomenon referred Warburg effect. Cytoplasmic pyruvate converted lactate. WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces transcription genes involved cell proliferation, i.e., MYC CYCLIN D1. ultimately promotes nucleotide, protein lipid synthesis necessary cell growth multiplication. cancer, activation PI3K-AKT pathway induces increase aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 activating canonical WNT pathway plays also role cancer. addition many cancer cells, PPAR gamma downregulated. Moreover, PPAR gamma contributes regulate key circadian genes. cancers, abnormalities regulation circadian rhythms (CRs) observed. CRs dissipative structures play key-role far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. cancers, metabolism, thermodynamics CRs intimately interrelated.
