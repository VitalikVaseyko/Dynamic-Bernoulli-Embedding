 Aging biological process characterized gradual loss physiological function increases susceptibility disease individual. aging process, wide spectrum alterations mitochondria mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) observed somatic tissues humans animals. associated decline mitochondrial respiratory function; excess production reactive oxygen species (ROS); increase oxidative damage mtDNA, lipids proteins mitochondria; accumulation point mutations large-scale deletions mtDNA; altered expression genes involved intermediary metabolism. demonstrated ROS may cause oxidative damage mutations mtDNA alterations expression several clusters genes aging tissues senescent cells. found intracellular levels hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidative damage DNA tissue cells skin fibroblasts old donors higher young donors. H2O2-induced senescent skin fibroblasts, observed increase protein expression activity levels manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase concurrent decrease activity cytochrome c oxidase rate oxygen consumption. Moreover, mRNA protein expression levels pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) decreased PDH kinase lactate dehydrogenase increased senescent skin fibroblasts. changes expression enzymes suggest metabolic shift mitochondrial respiration glycolysis major supply ATP aging human cells. hand, recent studies mitochondrial mutant mice, carry proofreading deficient subunit DNA polymerase gamma, revealed mtDNA mutations accumulated somatic tissues mice displayed prominent features aging. Taken together, suggest respiratory function decline increase production ROS mitochondria, accumulation mtDNA mutation oxidative damage, altered expression clusters genes culminated metabolic shift mitochondrial respiration glycolysis major supply ATP key contributory factors aging process human animals.
