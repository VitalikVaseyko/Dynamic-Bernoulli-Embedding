 1. Tissue oxygen uptake enzyme activities investigated naked mole rat, Heterocephalus glaber, mammal notable low body temperature metabolism poor temperature regulating ability. 2. Q10 O2 uptake Heterocephalus crude liver homogenates ranged 1.91 temperature interval 25-30 degrees C 1.76 within range 30-38 degrees C, values similar reported typical homoiotherms. 3. Km pyruvate lactate dehydrogenase heart muscle temperature dependence mole rat mouse. 4. O2 uptake cytochrome oxidase activity skeletal muscle higher mole rat mouse. reverse true heart muscle. Brain liver O2 uptake showed similar values species, kidney O2 uptake highest mouse. 5. Pyruvate kinase activity heart skeletal muscle higher mouse mole rat, suggesting greater reliance glycolysis former. 6. Na+, K+ -ATPase activity liver kidney 60% higher mouse mole rat, brain 30% higher mouse. 7. results indicate effects temperature tissue metabolism mole rat conform typical homoiotherms. low body temperature O2 uptake mole rat find expression tissue respiratory capacity.
