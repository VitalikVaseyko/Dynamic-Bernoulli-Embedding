 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) recently emerged attractive target cancer therapy. Herein, prepared series compounds derived dichloroacetate (DCA) inhibited cancer cells proliferation. first time, successfully developed DCA derived inhibitors preferentially bind adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pocket PDK isoform 1 (PDK1).
