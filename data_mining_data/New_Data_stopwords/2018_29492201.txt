 Alternative TrkAIII splicing characterises advanced stage metastatic disease post-therapeutic relapse neuroblastoma (NB), NB models TrkAIII exhibits oncogenic activity. study, report novel role TrkAIII signaling ER stress mitochondria SH-SY5Y NB cells results glycolytic metabolic adaptation. ER stress-inducing agents DTT, A23187 thapsigargin activated ER stress-response control pcDNA SH-SY5Y TrkAIII expressing SH-SY5Y cells TrkAIII SH-SY5Y cells increased TrkAIII targeting mitochondria internalisation inner-mitochondrial membranes. Within inner-mitochondrial membranes, TrkAIII subjected Omi/HtrA2-dependent cleavage tyrosine phosphorylated 45-48kDa carboxyl terminal active fragments, localised predominantly tyrosine kinase-domain mitochondrial matrix orientation. stress-induced activation mitochondrial TrkAIII associated increased ROS production, prevented ROS scavenger Resveratrol underpinned changes Ca2+ movement, implicating ROS/Ca2+ interplay overcoming mitochondrial TrkAIII activation threshold. Stress-induced, cleavage-activation mitochondrial TrkAIII resulted mitochondrial PDHK1 tyrosine phosphorylation, leading glycolytic metabolic adaptation. novel mitochondrial role TrkAIII provides potential self-perpetuating, drug reversible way tumour microenvironmental stress may maintain metastasis promoting "Warburg effect" TrkAIII expressing NBs.
