 normal cells, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level proportional activity mitochondrial electron transport tightly controlled endogenous antioxidant system. However, energy metabolism ROS homeostasis cancer cells much different normal cells. example, majority cellular glucose metabolized aerobic glycolysis ("Warburg effect") pentose phosphate pathway. Cancer cells harbor functional mitochondria, many mutations nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial genes mitochondrial genome result mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming. characteristic cancer cells maintain much higher ROS level normal cells. Ironically, cancer cells overexpress ROS-producing NADPH oxidase ROS-eliminating antioxidant enzymes, enzyme systems share NADPH reducing power source. article, review complex connection ROS energy metabolisms cancer cells.
