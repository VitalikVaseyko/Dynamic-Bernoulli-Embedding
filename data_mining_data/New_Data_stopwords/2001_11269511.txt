 Endothelial cells (EC) infected VHL strain cytomegalovirus (CMV) resistant p53-mediated apoptosis, may relevant EC dysfunction atherogenesis. resistance apoptosis may mediated cytoplasmic sequestration p53, functions nucleus. explored hypothesis CMV sequesters p53 cytoplasm blocking p53 nuclear localization signal (NLS) function. transfected VHL CMV infected EC recombinant p53 NLSI conjugated chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) plasmid. NLSI responsible 90% p53 nuclear localization, PK normally translocated nucleus cytoplasmic production. Thus cannot localized nucleus without assistance artificial NLSI. double-labeling immunofluorescence staining method used identify localization p53 NLSI-conjugated PK CMV-infected EC. found CMV infection sequesters PK p53 cytoplasm blocking NLSI function. inactivation NLSI function dependent upon infection stage; occurs early late phases immediate early phase infection. findings may relevant endothelial dysfunction initiation atherogenesis. study also suggests novel mechanism p53 inactivation virus, may important atherogenesis tumorgenesis.
