 Cancer cells characterized general decrease mitochondrial respiration oxidative phosphorylation, together strong enhancement glycolysis, so-called Warburg effect. decrease mitochondrial activity cancer cells may multiple reasons, related either input reducing equivalents electron transfer chain direct alterations mitochondrial respiratory complexes. cases, depression respiratory activity clearly consequence disruptive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations leads consequence enhanced generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). acting mutagens cellular mitogens, ROS may contribute directly cancer progression. basis experimental evidence, suggest deep implication supercomplex organization respiratory chain missing link oxidative stress, energy failure, tumorigenesis. speculate conditions oxidative stress, dissociation mitochondrial supercomplexes occurs, destabilization complex secondary enhanced generation ROS, thus leading vicious circle amplifying mitochondrial dysfunction. excellent model dissect role pathogenic, disassembling mtDNA mutations tumor progression contribution metabolic reprogramming cancer cells (glycolysis vs. respiration) provided often underdiagnosed subset tumors, namely, oncocytomas, characterized disruptive mutations mtDNA, especially complex subunits. mutations almost completely abolish complex activity, slows Krebs cycle, favoring high ratio alpha-ketoglutarate/succinate consequent destabilization hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). hand, complex partially defective, levels NAD(+) may sufficient implement Krebs cycle higher levels intermediates stabilize HIF1alpha, thus favoring tumor malignancy. threshold model propose, based population-like dynamics mitochondrial genetics (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies threshold complex present functioning correctly, thus favoring tumor growth, whereas threshold, complex assembled, tumor growth arrested. therefore termed "oncojanus" mtDNA genes whose disruptive mutations double-edged effect.
