 BACKGROUND: Overexpression transketolase-like 1 protein TKTL1 cancer cells reported correlate enhanced glycolysis lactic acid production. Furthermore, enhanced TKTL1 expression put context resistance chemotherapy ionizing radiation. Here, panel human malign benign cells, cover broad range chemotherapy radiation resistance well reliance glucose metabolism, analyzed vitro TKTL1 expression. METHODS: 17 malign three benign cell lines characterized according expression TKTL1 protein level three commercially available anti-TKTL1 antibodies utilizing immunohistochemistry Western blot, well mRNA level three published primer pairs RT-qPCR. Furthermore, sensitivities paclitaxel, cisplatin ionizing radiation assessed cell survival assays. Glucose consumption lactate production quantified surrogates "Warburg effect". RESULTS: Considerable amounts tktl1 mRNA TKTL1 protein detected upon stable transfection human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 expression plasmid human TKTL1. Beyond that, weak expression endogenous tktl1 mRNA measured cell lines JAR U251. Western blot analysis JAR U251 cells detect TKTL1 expected size 65 kDa three antibodies specific TKTL1 protein immunohistochemical staining observed antibody JFC12T10 only. cell lines tested revealed expression tktl1 mRNA detection limits negative TKTL1 protein. However, cell lines including TKTL1-negative HEK293-control cells, antibody JFC12T10 detected multiple proteins different molecular weights. Importantly, JAR U251 neither demonstrate outstanding production lactic acid increased resistance chemotherapeutics ionizing radiation, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using RT-qPCR three different antibodies observed exceptional occurrence TKTL1 panel malignant human cell lines vitro. presence TKTL1 unrelated either rate glucose consumption/lactic acid production resistance chemo- radiotherapy.
