 regulation ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel activity complex multitude factors determine open probability. Physiologically pathophysiologically, important intracellular nucleotides, long-recognized role glycolytically derived ATP regulating channel activity. identify novel regulatory subunits K(ATP) channel complex, performed two-hybrid protein-protein interaction screen, using bait mouse Kir6.2 C terminus. Screening rat heart cDNA library, identified two potential interacting proteins glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) triose-phosphate isomerase. veracity interaction verified co-immunoprecipitation techniques transfected mammalian cells. additionally demonstrated pyruvate kinase also interacts Kir6.2 subunits. physiological relevance interactions illustrated demonstration native Kir6.2 protein similarly interact GAPDH pyruvate kinase rat heart membrane fractions Kir6.2 protein co-localize glycolytic enzymes rat ventricular myocytes. functional relevance findings demonstrated ability GAPDH pyruvate kinase substrates directly block K(ATP) channel patch clamp recording conditions. Taken together, data provide direct evidence concept key enzymes involved glycolytic ATP production part multisubunit K(ATP) channel protein complex. data consistent concept activity enzymes (possibly ATP formation immediate intracellular microenvironment macromolecular K(ATP) channel complex) causes channel closure.
