 investigate effects estrogen, hormone responsible vitellogenesis, gluconeogenesis, male rainbow trout implanted 17 beta-estradiol given sham procedure. Plasma glucose concentration estrogenized fish 50% control fish (6.4 mM). Glucose synthesis physiological concentrations alanine 0.08 mumol.g cells-1 x h-1 compared 0.20 mumol.g cells-1 x h-1 control fish; synthesis physiological concentrations lactate reduced 50% (0.88 vs. 0.36 mumol.g cells-1 x h-1) implanted fish. Gluconeogenesis 5 mM lactate also significantly depressed implanted fish. Oxidation alanine, serine, lactate significantly affected estrogen implantation. maximum clearance velocity key enzyme negatively regulating gluconeogenesis, pyruvate kinase, 3.03 mumol.g cells-1 x h-1 estrogen (E2) implanted fish compared 7.83 mumol.g cells-1 x h-1 control fish. significant differences plasma insulin glucagon found two groups. conclude estrogen depresses gluconeogenesis reduction contributes lower plasma glucose concentration seen vitellogenic trout.
