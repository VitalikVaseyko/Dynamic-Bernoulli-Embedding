 Everyday administration citrate (250 mg/kg body mass) healthy rats within 4 days inhibited activities pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase reverse lactate dehydrogenase liver tissue sceletal muscles. Within longer period citrate administration (8 12 days) activities pyruvate dehydrogenase alanine transaminase continued decrease liver tissue, time, content pyruvate proceeded increase sceletal muscles. distinct inhibitory effect citrate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed liver tissue sceletal muscles tumor-bearing animals. Alanine transaminase, inactivated liver tissue healthy animals citrate treatment, markedly activated tumor-bearing rats conditions. data obtained suggest regulatory functions citrate qualitatively transformed tumor-bearing animals, mainly, relation turnover glucogenic amino acids.
