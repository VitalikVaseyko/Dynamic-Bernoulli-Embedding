 Ehrlich ascites tumor-bearing mice subjected 14CO2 radiorespirometric analysis administration [U-14C]glucose, results compared levels host liver glycolytic enzyme activities uptake radioactivity liver. IP administration [U-14C]glucose, progressive decline respiratory 14CO2 transplantation Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. peak time (PT) 10 min day 1, thereafter increasingly delayed, could determined day 13. Peak height (PH) yield value (YV) considerably decreased, magnitudes changes increased time transplantation tumor cells. Glycolytic enzyme activities host liver normal levels 13 days transplantation tumor cells. uptake radioactivity liver IP administration [U-14C]glucose began decline day 5 50% value normal mice 13 days transplantation tumor cells. results indicate radiorespirometric patterns [U-14C]glucose reflects hepatic biochemical changes rather well.
