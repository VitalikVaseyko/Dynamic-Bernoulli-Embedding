 examined transfected cells immunofluorescence microscopy determine signals structural features required targeting integral membrane proteins inner nuclear membrane. Lamin B receptor (LBR) resident protein nuclear envelope inner membrane nucleoplasmic, amino-terminal domain carboxyl-terminal domain eight putative transmembrane segments. amino-terminal domain LBR target cytosolic protein nucleus type II integral protein inner nuclear membrane. Neither nuclear localization signal (NLS) soluble protein, full-length histone H1, target integral protein inner nuclear membrane although target cytosolic proteins nucleus. addition NLS protein normally located inner nuclear membrane, however, inhibit targeting. amino-terminal domain LBR increased size approximately 22.5 approximately 70 kD, chimeric protein cannot reach inner nuclear membrane. carboxyl-terminal domain LBR, separated amino-terminal domain, also concentrates inner nuclear membrane, demonstrating two nonoverlapping targeting signals protein. Signals structural features required inner nuclear membrane targeting proteins distinct involved targeting soluble polypeptides nucleoplasm. structure nucleocytoplasmic domain inner nuclear membrane protein also influences targeting, possibly size constraints dictated lateral channels nuclear pore complexes.
