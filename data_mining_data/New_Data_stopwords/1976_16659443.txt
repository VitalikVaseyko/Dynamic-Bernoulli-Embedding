 Oxygen uptake presence exogenous glucose lower Tamarix root tips grown saline media grown Hoagland solution. effect overcome raising external glucose concentration.Glucose uptake CO(2) evolution depressed presence NaCl. effect observed also roots exposed salinity growth uptake. Increasing external concentration glucose 0.01 1 mm induced 10-fold increase glucose uptake CO(2) evolution. However, (14)C evolved CO(2) percent (14)C absorbed, remained constant salinity treatments, similar glucose concentrations.Salinity 120 mm NaCl increased percentage absorbed glucose oxidized via pentose phosphate pathway, affect glycolytic pathway. time, salinity depressed glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, oxidative phosphorylation. effects become evident salinity level - 10 atm (240 mm), concentration rarely exceeded root zone natural habitat plants.We concluded Tamarix reasonably well adapted conditions habitat, salinity affects root metabolism differently pea roots.
