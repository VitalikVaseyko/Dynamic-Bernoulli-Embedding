 Activation oncogenic kinase Akt stimulates glucose uptake metabolism cancer cells renders cells susceptible death response glucose withdrawal. show 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) reverses sensitivity Akt-expressing glioblastoma cells glucose deprivation. AICAR's protection depends activation AMPK, expression dominant-negative form AMPK abolished effect. AMPK cellular energy sensor whose activation block anabolic pathways protein synthesis activate catabolic reactions fatty acid oxidation maintain cellular bioenergetics. rapamycin treatment mimicked effect AICAR inhibiting markers cap-dependent translation, failed protect Akt-expressing cells death upon glucose withdrawal. Compared control cells, Akt-expressing cells impaired ability induce fatty acid oxidation response glucose deprivation unless stimulated AICAR. Stimulation fatty acid oxidation sufficient maintain cell survival activation fatty acid oxidation bezafibrate also protected Akt-expressing cells glucose withdrawal-induced death. Conversely, treatment CPT-1 inhibitor block fatty acid import mitochondria prevented AICAR stimulating fatty acid oxidation promoting cell survival absence glucose. Finally, cell survival require reversal Akt's effects either protein translation lipid synthesis addition cell penetrant oxidizable substrate methyl-pyruvate sufficient maintain survival Akt-expressing cells deprived glucose. Together, data suggest activation Akt blocks ability cancer cells metabolize nonglycolytic bioenergetic substrates, leading glucose addiction.
