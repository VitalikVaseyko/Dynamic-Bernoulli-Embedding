 regulatory behavior rabbit pyruvate kinase studied function pH. initial velocity enzyme-catalysed reaction function ADP concentration analysed exponential model regulatory enzyme. analysis exponential model parameters functions pH provided pK values 6.6 8.08 free enzyme fully ADP-bound conformation. contrast, binding ADP ADP-free conformation free enzyme involve groups ionize within pH range (6.2-8.5) experiments. results suggest homotropic allosteric interactions actually alter mode ADP binding. pK values 6.63 9.00 determined analysis V function pH readily interpreted terms direct phosphoryl-transfer mechanism beta-phosphoryl group ADP (pK 6.63) acts nucleophile lysine epsilon-amino group (pK 9.0) acts proton donor pyruvate kinase reaction.
