 Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) upregulated various solid tumors, process associated tumor progression metastasis. present study aimed investigate role underlying mechanism MIF human lung cancer. Human lung cancer H358, H460, H524, H1650, H838, H1975 A549 cell lines used examine expression MIF real timequantitative polymerase chain reaction western blotting. lentivirus used overexpress MIF expression MIF hypoxiainducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) knocked shRNA siRNA. proliferation cell lines detected MTT assay. Glucose uptake, adenosine 5'triphosphate (ATP) production, glycolytic rate lactate production used examine Warburg effect cells. BAY 117082 (BAY) used inhibit nuclear translocation nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB), detected using immunofluorescence. revealed overexpression MIF promoted cell proliferation Warburg effect lung cancer, whereas knockdown MIF inhibited cell proliferation Warburg effect. Mechanistically, MIF promoted Warburg effect upregulating HIF1alpha. Knockdown HIF1alpha largely abolished promotional effect MIF Warburg effect. Additionally, results current study provided evidence MIF regulates HIF1alpha NFkappaB. conclusion, findings present study demonstrated MIF key component lung cancer progression promoting Warburg effect, novel MIF/NFkappaB/HIF1alpha axis may prove useful development new strategies treating patients lung cancer.
