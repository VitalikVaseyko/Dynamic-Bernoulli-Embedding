 Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase modified bromopyruvate kinetic behavior modified enzyme investigated. enzyme modified bromopyruvate absence adenosine-5'-diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate fructose-1,6-diphosphate inactivation followed pseudo first-order kinetics. inactivation rate constant, ks, 1.84 +/- 0.15 min(-1). Kd bromopyruvate-enzyme complex 0.14 +/- 0.03 mM. presence adenosine-5'-diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate fructose-1,6-diphosphate modification medium presence fructose-1,6-diphosphate assay medium resulted deviation inactivation kinetics pseudo first-order. Phosphoenolpyruvate better adenosine-5'-diphosphate protection bromopyruvate modification whereas fructose-1,6-diphosphate ineffective. modified enzyme showed negative cooperativity presence fructose-1,6-diphosphate whereas absence activity detected.
