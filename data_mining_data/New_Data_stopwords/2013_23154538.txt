 glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) required cancer development, implicated metabolic transition oxidative fermentative metabolism, Warburg effect. However, global metabolic response follows changes PK activity yet fully understood. Using shotgun proteomics, identified 31 yeast proteins regulated PK-dependent manner. Selective reaction monitoring confirmed expression dependent PK isoform, level activity. PK targets amino acid metabolizing enzymes factors protein translation, indicating PK plays global regulatory role biosynthethic amino acid metabolism. Indeed, found strongly altered amino acid profiles PK levels changed. Low PK levels increased cellular glutamine glutamate concentrations, decreased levels seven amino acids including serine histidine. test evolutionary conservation PK function, quantified orthologues identified PK targets thyroid follicular adenoma, tumor characterized high PK levels low respiratory activity. Aminopeptidase AAP-1 serine hydroxymethyltransferase SHMT1 showed PKM2- concentration dependence, upregulated tumor. Thus, PK expression levels activity important maintaining cellular amino acid homeostasis. Mediating energy production, ROS clearance amino acid biosynthesis, PK thus plays central regulatory role metabolism proliferating cells.
