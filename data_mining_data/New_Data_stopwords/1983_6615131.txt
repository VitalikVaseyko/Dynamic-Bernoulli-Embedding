 thermostability several enzymes facultative thermophilic actinomycete Streptomyces sp., derived cells grown temperature range 37 degrees C 60 degrees C, examined. correlation growth temperature cultures heat stability enzymes could demonstrated alanine dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, myokinase pyruvate kinase. Except isocitrate dehydrogenase, showed linear increase stability throughout entire temperature range, enzymes exhibited steep increase heat stability 50 degrees C, increase higher growth range, suggesting, 50 degrees C upward shift exclusive production thermostable protein occurs. Furthermore, stability alanine dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase found increase substantially presence substrates. contrast, substrate-mediated stabilization weak glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase totally absent acetate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase myokinase. comparison previous observations enzymes Bacillus flavothermus showed, enzymes different organisms different thermal properties. Determination fatty acid composition Streptomyces sp. cells, grown different temperatures, showed relatively small alterations, main changes occurring 37 degrees C 40 degrees C.
