 identification prognostic markers hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) needed clinical practice. Tripartite motif-containing 35 (TRIM35) tumor suppressor HCC. TRIM35 inhibits phosphorylation pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), involved aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. found expression PKM2 significantly increased HCC tissues. overexpression PKM2 correlated high TNM stage level vascular invasion. Patients HCC positive PKM2 expression negative TRIM35 expression shorter overall survival time recurrence patients negative PKM2 positive TRIM35. Furthermore, PKM2/TRIM35 combination independent significant risk factor recurrence survival. conclusion, PKM2 (+) TRIM35 (-) contribute aggressiveness poor prognosis HCC. PKM2/TRIM35 expression could biomarker prognosis HCC target cancer therapy.
