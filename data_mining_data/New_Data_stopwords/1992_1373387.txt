 New hepatocyte-like cell lines (mhAT) derived liver transgenic mouse expressing SV40 early genes direction liver-specific antithrombin III gene promoter (ATIII-TSV40). differentiated phenotypes improved stabilized use liver-specific growth media (arginine-free, glucose-free, low-fructose/glucose-free medium). best differentiated lines display high level albumin, transferrin, L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene expression comparable observed mouse liver. Abundance aldolase B phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) transcripts varied 5 35% vivo concentrations abundance alpha-fetoprotein phenylalanine hydroxylase transcripts remained low. Hormonal (cAMP insulin) nutritional (glucose) gene controls PEPCK L-PK were, least partially, conserved. mhAT cells readily transfectable calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique exhibit liver-specific pattern expression exogenous genes. Thus, mhAT cells seem suitable analysis regulatory regions involved tissue-specific transcription genes. work demonstrates, therefore, great efficiency targeted carcinogenesis transgenic mice create new differentiated cell lines. availability various lines liver-specific cells different phenotypes constitute useful tools establish correlations expression trans-acting factors control phenotype.
