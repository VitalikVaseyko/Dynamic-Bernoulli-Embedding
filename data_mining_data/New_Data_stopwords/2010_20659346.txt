 BACKGROUND: biological functions controlled brain related disorders closely associated activation specific regions brain. Neuroproteomics applied analysis whole brain, general pattern protein expression regions elucidated. However, comprehensive proteome brain region remains unclear. RESULTS: study, carried comparative proteomics six regions adult rat brain: thalamus, hippocampus, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, amygdala using semi-quantitative analysis Mascot Score identified proteins. order identify efficiently proteins present brain, proteins separated combination SDS-PAGE C18 column-equipped nano-liquid chromatograph, analyzed quadrupole-time flight-tandem-mass spectrometry. proteomic data show 2,909 peptides rat brain, 200 identified region-abundant proteins semi-quantitative analysis. regions containing identified proteins membrane (20.0%), cytoplasm (19.5%), mitochondrion (17.1%), cytoskeleton (8.2%), nucleus (4.7%), extracellular region (3.3%), (18.0%). identified proteins, expressions glial fibrillary acidic protein, GABA transporter 3, Septin 5, heat shock protein 90, synaptotagmin, heat shock protein 70, pyruvate kinase confirmed immunoblotting. examined distributions rat brain GABA transporter 3, glial fibrillary acidic protein, heat shock protein 70 immunohistochemistry, found proteins localized around regions observed proteomic analysis immunoblotting. IPA analysis indicates pathways closely related biological functions region may activated rat brain. CONCLUSIONS: observations indicate proteomics region adult rat brain may provide novel way elucidate biological actions associated activation regions brain.
