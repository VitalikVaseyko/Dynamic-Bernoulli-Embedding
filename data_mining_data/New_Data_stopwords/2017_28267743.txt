 Targeted proteomics approaches value deep accurate quantification protein abundance. Extending methods quantify large numbers proteins requires construction predefined targeted assays. developed targeted proteomics platform-in vitro proteome-assisted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) protein absolute quantification (iMPAQT)-by using >18,000 human recombinant proteins, thus enabling protein absolute quantification genome-wide scale. platform comprises experimentally confirmed MRM assays mass tag (mTRAQ)-labeled peptides allow rapid straightforward measurement absolute abundance predefined sets proteins mass spectrometry. applied iMPAQT delineate quantitative metabolic landscape normal transformed human fibroblasts. Oncogenic transformation gave rise relatively small global changes metabolic pathways resulting aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) increased rates macromolecule synthesis. iMPAQT facilitate quantitative biology studies based protein abundance measurements.
