 dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex forms 60-subunit core E2's inner domain forms dodecahedron shaped structure surrounded globular outer domains connected inner domain 2-3-kDa mobile hinge regions. Two outer domains approximately 10 kDa lipoyl domains, NH2-terminal one, E2L1, and, first hinge region second one, E2L2. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase binds tightly lipoyl domain region oligomeric E2 core phosphorylates inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. wished determine whether lipoyl domain constructs prepared recombinant techniques cDNA human E2 could bind bovine E1 kinase and, case, pursue lipoyl domain kinase binds. also wished gain insights molecule kinase tightly bound E2 core rapidly phosphorylate 20-30 molecules pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component also bound outer domain E2 core. prepared recombinant constructs consisting entire lipoyl domain region individual lipoyl domains without intervening hinge region. Constructs made used free lipoyl domains fused glutathione S-transferase (GST). Using GSH-Sepharose selectively bind GST constructs, tightly bound kinase shown rapidly transfer highly preferential way intact E2 core GST constructs containing E2L2 domain rather ones containing E2L1 domain. GST-E2L2-kinase complexes could eluted GSH-Sepharose glutathione. Delipoylation E2L2 treatment lipoamidase eliminated kinase binding supporting direct role lipoyl prosthetic group association. Transfer selective binding kinase E2L2 E2L1 also demonstrated free constructs using sucrose gradient procedure separate large E2 core various lipoyl domain constructs. E2L2 E2L1 increased activity resolved kinase 43%. conclude kinase selectively binds inner lipoyl domain E2 subunits association involves lipoyl prosthetic group. suggest transfer tightly bound kinase E2L2 domains occurs direct interchange mechanism without formation free kinase (model presented).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
