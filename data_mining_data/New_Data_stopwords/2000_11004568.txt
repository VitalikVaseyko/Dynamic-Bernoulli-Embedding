 mechanism action structurally distinct pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitors examined assays experimental contexts ranging intact pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) without supplemental ATP ADP synthetic peptide substrate PDK autophosphorylation. compounds directly inhibited catalytic activity PDKs. inhibitor classes tested inhibited autophosphorylation recombinant PDK1 PDK2. studies, PDC shown directly inhibited novel mechanism; addition supplemental recombinant PDKs, effect ADP-dependent partly alleviated members compound classes tested. Overall, data demonstrate small molecules acting diverse sites inhibit PDK activity.
