 Cancer cells possess fundamentally altered metabolism provides foundation support tumorigenicity malignancy. understanding biochemical underpinnings cancer benefited integrated utilization large-scale profiling platforms (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), which, together, provide global assessment enzymes parent metabolic networks become altered cancer fuel tumor growth. review presents several examples integrated platforms yielded fundamental insights dysregulated metabolism cancer. also discuss questions challenges must addressed completely describe, eventually control, diverse metabolic pathways support tumorigenesis.
