 rate, key enzymes, several metabolites glycolysis rat hepatoma (HTC) cells compared rat hepatocytes. 5 10 mM glucose, lactate release greater HTC cells. could explained part absence key gluconeogenic enzymes, substitution glucokinase hexokinase, increase phosphofructokinase 1 pyruvate kinase activity. addition, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, potent stimulator phosphofructokinase 1, identified HTC cells shown stimulate phosphofructokinase 1 partially purified cells. Dexamethasone increased release lactate HTC cells. glucocorticoid increased concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate Vmax enzyme catalyzes synthesis, phosphofructokinase 2. data consistent indirect effect gene level, mediated glucocorticoid receptors. Dexamethasone effect rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes. Several agents (adenosine, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, ethanol, antimycin) known decrease fructose 2,6-bisphosphate hepatocytes without effect stimulator HTC cells. DL-Glyceraldehyde inhibited glycolysis HTC cells eventually killed them. Although substance decreased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition glycolysis action another level could ruled out.
