 Cancer, main cause human deaths modern world group diseases. Anticancer drug discovery challenge scientists involvement multiple survival pathways cancer cells. extensive study regulation step pathways may help find potential cancer target. Up-regulated HIF-1 expression altered metabolic pathways two classical characteristics cancer. Oxygen-dependent (through pVHL, PHDs, calcium-mediated) independent (through growth factor signaling pathway, mdm2 pathway, HSP90) regulation HIF-1alpha leads angiogenesis, metastasis, cell survival. two subunits HIF-1 regulates fashion different mechanisms. HIF-1alpha translation upregulates via mammalian target rapamycin mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, whereas HIF-1beta calmodulin kinase. Further, stabilized interactions two subunits important proper functioning. Also, metabolic pathways crucial formation building blocks (pentose phosphate pathway) energy generation (glycolysis, TCA cycle catabolism glutamine) altered cancer cells protect oxidative stress meet reduced oxygen nutrient supply. Up-regulated anaerobic metabolism occurs enhanced expression hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase down-regulation aerobic metabolism via pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lactate dehydrogenase compensate energy requirements along high glucose intake. Controlled expression two pathways common intermediate may serve potent cancer target future.
