 PURPOSE: Hepatic ischemia reperfusion cause several problems hepatic surgery. aim study determine pyruvate kinase activation lipid peroxidation hepatic ischemia. METHODS: Twenty-four Wistar rats submitted 90 minutes selective liver ischemia 15 minutes reperfusion. Twelve animals submitted selective liver ischemia reperfusion (Group A) 12 submitted sham operation (Group B). 15 minutes reperfusion, following parameters measured: mean arterial pressure (MAP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glycemia (GLY), hepatic glycogen (GH), pyruvate kinase (PK) activation, hepatic glutathione (GSH) malondialdehyde (MDA). Analysis results made Student t-test considered significant difference p<0.05. RESULTS: B differents parameters analized. CONCLUSION: animals group showed reperfusion syndrome fall MAP, activation glycid metabolism glycolitic pathway presence lipid peroxidation compared group B.
