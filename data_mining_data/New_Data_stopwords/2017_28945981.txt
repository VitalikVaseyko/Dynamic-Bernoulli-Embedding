 high-throughput screen (HTS) human 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) resulted several series compounds potential optimization. Informatics used identify active chemotypes lead-like profiles remove compounds commonly occurred actives HTS screens. activities confirmed IC50 measurements two orthogonal assay technologies, analysis Hill slopes comparison ratio IC50 values 10 times enzyme concentration used identify artifact compounds. Several series compounds rejected high slopes poor ratios. small number compounds representing different leading series assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystal structure complex PFKFB3 solved. orthogonal assay technology isothermal calorimetry demonstrated unreliable identifying false-positive compounds case. Presented discovery dihydropyrrolopyrimidinone series compounds active novel inhibitors PFKFB3, shown X-ray crystallography bind adenosine triphosphate site. crystal structures series also reveal possible flip binding mode compounds, alternative orientation driven sigma-hole interaction aromatic chlorine atom backbone carbonyl oxygen. novel inhibitors enable studies explore role PFKFB3 driving glycolytic phenotype tumors.
