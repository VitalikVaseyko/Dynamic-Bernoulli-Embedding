 Common chromosomal fragile sites FRA3B FRA16D frequent sites DNA instability cancer, contribution cancer cell biology yet understood. Genes span sites (FHIT WWOX, respectively) often perturbed (either increased decreased) cancer cells able suppress tumour growth. WWOX tumour suppressor characteristics, normal role functional contribution cancer fully determined. find significant proportion Drosophila Wwox interactors identified proteomics microarray analyses roles aerobic metabolism. Functional relationships Wwox either CG6439/isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh) Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod) confirmed genetic interactions. addition, altered levels Wwox resulted altered levels endogenous reactive oxygen species. Wwox (like FHIT) contributes pathways involving aerobic metabolism oxidative stress, providing explanation 'non-classical tumour suppressor' behaviour WWOX. Fragile sites, genes span them, therefore part protective response mechanism oxidative stress likely contributors differences seen aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) cancer cells.
