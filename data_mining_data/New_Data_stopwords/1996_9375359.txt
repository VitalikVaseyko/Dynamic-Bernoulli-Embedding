 effect sodium orthovanadate activity 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) epithelial cells rat small intestine investigated. Injection vanadate (2.5 mg/rat) rats 2-day intervals per week two consecutive weeks resulted significant decrease maximal activities activity ratios (activity 0.5 mM fructose-6-phosphate pH 7.0/activity pH 8.0 [v0.5/V]) partially purified PFK rat jejunum. Also, sensitivity jejunal PFK inhibition ATP increased rats treated vanadate. addition 1 microM fructose-2,6-biphosphate 50 microM AMP assays released enzyme inhibition ATP, significant difference seen vanadate-injected control rats. Moreover, extent activation 1 microM fructose-2,6-bisphosphate significantly higher (79%) vanadate-injected rats control rats (26%). present results indicate rat jejunal PFK highly inhibited vanadate vivo. Therefore, although vanadate considered insulin-like agent, insulin-like effects adipocytes skeletal muscle, present results may indicate behavior could applicable normal rat tissues, effect vanadate jejunal PFK clearly opposite insulin.
