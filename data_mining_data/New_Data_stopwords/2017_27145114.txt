 SCOPE: Natural compounds regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) reported beneficial effects obesity-mediated metabolic disorders. study, demonstrated biochanin (BA), agonist PPAR-alpha, improved hepatic steatosis insulin resistance regulating hepatic lipid glucose metabolism. METHODS RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice fed normal chow diet, high-fat diet (HFD), HFD supplemented 0.05% BA 12 weeks. Histological biochemical examinations indicated BA prevented obesity-induced hepatic steatosis insulin resistance HFD-fed mice. BA stimulated transcriptional activation PPAR-alpha vitro increased expression PPAR-alpha regulatory proteins liver. CE-TOF/MS analyses indicated BA administration promoted recovery metabolites involved phosphatidylcholine synthesis, lipogenesis, beta-oxidation livers obese mice. BA also suppressed levels gluconeogenesis-related metabolites expression associated enzymes, glucose 6-phosphatase pyruvate kinase. CONCLUSION: Taken together, results showed BA ameliorated metabolic disorders hepatic steatosis insulin resistance modulating lipid glucose metabolism diet-induced obesity. Thus, BA may potential therapeutic agent prevention obesity-mediated hepatic steatosis insulin resistance.
