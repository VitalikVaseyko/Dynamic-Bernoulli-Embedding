 Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), polyphenol natural product plant Curcuma longa, undergoing early clinical trials novel anticancer agent. However, anticancer mechanism curcumin remains elucidated. Recently, shown curcumin inhibits phosphorylation p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), two downstream effector molecules mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) numerous cancer cell lines. study designed elucidate underlying mechanism. observed curcumin inhibited mTORC1 signaling inhibition upstream kinases, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Further, found curcumin inhibited mTORC1 signaling independently protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK-tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). evidenced findings curcumin able inhibit phosphorylation S6K1 4E-BP1 cells pretreated PP2A inhibitor (okadaic acid) AMPK inhibitor (compound C), cells expressing dominant-negative (dn) PP2A, shRNA PP2A-A subunit, dn-AMPKalpha. Curcumin alter TSC1/2 interaction. Knockout TSC2 affect curcumin inhibition mTOR signaling. Finally, identified curcumin able dissociate raptor mTOR, leading inhibition mTORC1 activity. Therefore, data indicate curcumin may represent new class mTOR inhibitor.
