 four-carbon dicarboxylic acid L-malate recently attracted attention due potential applications fields medicine agriculture. study, Escherichia coli W3110 engineered optimized L-malate production via one-step L-malate synthesis pathway. First, deletion genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), pyruvate oxidase (poxB), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB), phosphotransacetylase (pta), acetate kinase (ackA) pta-ackA pathway led accumulate 20.9 g/L pyruvate. Then, overexpression NADP(+) -dependent malic enzyme C490S mutant multi-deletion mutant resulted direct conversion pyruvate L-malate (3.62 g/L). Next, deletion genes responsible succinate biosynthesis enhanced L-malate production 7.78 g/L. Finally, L-malate production elevated 21.65 g/L L-malate yield 0.36 g/g 5 L bioreactor overexpressing pos5 gene encoding NADH kinase engineered E. coli F0931 strain. study demonstrates potential utility one-step pathway efficient L-malate production.
