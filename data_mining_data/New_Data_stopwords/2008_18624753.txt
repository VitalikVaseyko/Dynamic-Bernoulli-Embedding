 order understand transcriptional mechanism underlies cell protection stress, evaluated role CLP-1, known inhibitor transcription elongation complex (pTEFb), CLP-1 +/- mice hearts. Using isolated heart model, observed CLP-1 +/- hearts, subjected ischaemic stress evaluated haemodynamic measurements, exhibit significant cardioprotection. CLP-1 remains associated pTEFb complex heterozygous hearts, released wild-type hearts suggesting involvement pTEFb regulation cell protection. decrease Cdk7 Cdk9 kinase activity consequently phosphorylation serine-5 serine-2 Pol II CTD CLP-1 +/- hearts. However, levels mitochondrial proteins, PGC-1alpha HIF-1alpha, enhance mitochondrial activity implicated cell survival, increased CLP-1 +/- hearts subjected ischaemic stress compared wild-type CLP-1 +/- hearts treated identically. also increase expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-1), facilitates cell adaptation hypoxic stress. Taken together, data suggest regulation CLP-1 levels critical cellular adaptation survival program protects cardiomyocytes stress due collectively decrease RNA Pol II phosphorylation increase expression target proteins regulate mitochondrial function metabolic adaptation stress.
