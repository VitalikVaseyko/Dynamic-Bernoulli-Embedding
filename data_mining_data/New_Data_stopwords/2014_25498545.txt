 Betaine protects cells environmental stress serves methyl donor several biochemical pathways. reduces cardiovascular disease risk protects liver cells alcoholic liver damage nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. pretreatment rescue cells exposed toxins rotenone, chloroform, LiCl. Furthermore, suggested betaine suppress cancer cell growth vivo vitro. Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes generate mitochondrial membrane potential, essential produce cellular energy, ATP. Reduced mitochondrial respiration energy status found many human pathological conditions including aging, cancer, neurodegenerative disease. study investigated whether betaine directly targets mitochondria. show betaine treatment leads upregulation mitochondrial respiration cytochrome c oxidase activity H2.35 cells, proposed rate limiting enzyme ETC vivo. Following treatment, mitochondrial membrane potential increased cellular energy levels elevated. propose anti-proliferative effects betaine cancer cells might due enhanced mitochondrial function contributing reversal Warburg effect.
