 INTRODUCTION: well known cancer cells altered metabolism meet energy needs provide initial molecules synthesis macromolecules. cope new metabolic state, different forms certain enzymes expressed extreme amounts. enzymes seen attractive targets deal cancer. Pyruvate kinases isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) key enzyme determines whether glucose used energy synthesis biosynthetic molecules. dimeric form PKM2 main form several cancer cells serves formation synthetic precursors required cell growth proliferation glycolytic intermediates. Areas covered: article reviews appropriate publications PKM2 activators points view synthesis biological activities 2011-2017. Herein, based chemical structure, PKM2 activators classified sulfonamide, phenolic, carboxamide pyridopyrimidinone derivatives. Expert opinion: PKM2 activation inhibits cell growth proliferation decreasing number biomolecules required cell building. Therefore; PKM2 activators considered ideal drug treatment many cancer pathogens. necessary discover new, active selective compounds PKM2 activation.
