 food intake, liver composition hepatic activity pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH), malic enzyme (ME) acetyl CoA carboxylase (AcCoA Cx) studied starved-refed rats. rats refed mixed diet 3 days, food intake significantly increased (by 33%) day 1 3 glycogen accumulation maximal 24 hours, decreased significantly day 3 (by 34%). contrast, liver triglycerides sharply increased (10-fold) day 1 3. Furthermore, refeeding large increase G6P-DH, AcCoA Cx reached day 3 average activity 5.5- 6.5-fold higher fasting. rats refed conditions self-selection (carbohydrates, lipids proteins) total food intake day, lipid carbohydrate intakes varied reciprocally: lipid intake decreased whereas carbohydrate consumption increased 3 day refeeding period. Liver glycogen level unchanged triglyceride accumulation overshoot lipogenic enzymes highly attenuated: day 3, reached 50% values observed mixed diet refed rats. Administration 8-azaguanine refeeding self-selecting conditions lowered food intake effect pattern food intake first day. following days, lipid intake fell dramatically. Azaguanine alter liver glycogenesis, prevents liver triglyceride accumulation overshoot lipogenic enzymes.
