 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNA species involved post-transcriptional gene regulation. vitro studies identified small number skeletal muscle-specific miRNAs play crucial role myoblast proliferation differentiation. skeletal muscle, acute bout endurance exercise results up-regulation transcriptional networks regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose fatty acid metabolism, skeletal muscle remodelling. purpose study assess expressional profile targeted miRNA species following acute bout endurance exercise determine relationships previously established endurance exercise responsive transcriptional networks. C57Bl/6J wild-type male mice (N = 7/group) randomly assigned either sedentary forced-endurance exercise (treadmill run @ 15 m/min 90 min) group. endurance exercise group sacrificed three hours following single bout exercise. expression miR- 181, 1, 133, 23, 107, predicted regulate transcription factors co-activators involved adaptive response exercise, measured quadriceps femoris muscle. Endurance exercise significantly increased expression miR-181, miR-1, miR-107 37%, 40%, 56%, respectively, reduced miR-23 expression 84% (P<or=0.05 all), change miR-133. Importantly, decreased expression miRNA-23, putative negative regulator PGC-1alpha consistent increased expression PGC-1alpha mRNA protein along several downstream targets PGC-1alpha including ALAS, CS, cytochrome c mRNA. PDK4 protein content remains unaltered despite increase putative negative regulator, miR-107, PDK4 mRNA expression. mRNA expression miRNA processing machinery (Drosha, Dicer, DGCR8) remained unchanged. conclude miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation potentially involved complex regulatory networks govern skeletal muscle adaptation endurance exercise C57Bl/6J male mice.
