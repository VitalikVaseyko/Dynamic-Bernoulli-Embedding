 Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) crucial protein responsible aerobic glycolysis cancer cells. Activation PKM2 may alter aberrant metabolism cancer cells. study, discovered 4-hydroxy-thiazolidine-2-thione compound 2 novel PKM2 activator random screening in-house compound library. series novel 4-hydroxy-thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives designed synthesized screening potent PKM2 activators. Among these, compounds showed higher PKM2 activation activity lead compound 2 also exhibited significant anti-proliferative activities human cancer cell lines nanomolar concentration. compound 5w identified potent antitumor agent, showed excellent anti-proliferative effects IC50 values 0.46 muM 0.81 muM H1299, HCT116, Hela PC3 cell lines. 5w also showed less cytotoxicity non-tumor cell line HELF compared cancer cells. addition, Preliminary pharmacological studies revealed 5w arrests cell cycle G2/M phase HCT116 cell line. best PKM2 activation compound 5t rationalized docking studies.
