 Little known mechanisms responsible fall fatty acid oxidation development cardiac hypertrophy. focused effects nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation cardiac hypertrophy activity peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta, predominant PPAR subtype cardiac cells plays prominent role regulation cardiac lipid metabolism. Phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy neonatal rat cardiomyocytes caused reduction expression pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (Pdk4), target gene PPARbeta/delta involved fatty acid utilization, fall palmitate oxidation reversed NF-kappaB inhibitors. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation NF-kappaB embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 myotubes, express PPARbeta/delta, caused reduction Pdk4 expression DNA binding activity PPARbeta/delta response element, effects reversed NF-kappaB inhibitors. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated lipopolysaccharide strongly stimulated physical interaction p65 subunit NF-kappaB PPARbeta/delta, providing explanation reduced activity PPARbeta/delta. Finally, assessed whether mechanism present vivo pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. hypertrophied hearts banded rats reduction expression Pdk4 accompanied activation NF-kappaB enhanced interaction p65 PPARbeta/delta. results indicate NF-kappaB activation cardiac hypertrophy down-regulates PPARbeta/delta activity, leading fall fatty acid oxidation, mechanism involves enhanced protein-protein interaction p65 subunit NF-kappaB PPARbeta/delta.
