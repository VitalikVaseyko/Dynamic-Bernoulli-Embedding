 Pyruvate dehydrogenase catalyst irreversible step degradation glucose activity regulated highly specific protein kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). PDK belongs family mitochondrial protein kinases unique eukaryotic protein kinases. cloned cDNA encoding putative PDK Drosophila melanogaster (DmPDK). deduced DmPDK consists 413 amino acids shares 57.8% homology human rat PDK isoenzymes. Developmental Northern blot analysis revealed two major transcripts 2.1 kb 2.7 kb. 2.7-kb transcript expressed throughout ontogeny, whereas 2.1-kb transcript specific embryos adult females. Whole-mount situ hybridization revealed PDK mRNA ubiquitously distributed embryo. DmPdk gene cytologically mapped 45CD region right arm second chromosome.
