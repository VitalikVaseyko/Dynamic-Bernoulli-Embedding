 Chronic restraint stress induces cardiac dysfunction well cardiomyocyte injury including severe ultrastructural alteration cell death, mechanism molecular basis remain unclear. Mitochondria play key role regulating cell life. exploring mitochondrial proteins correlate stress-induced injury, two-dimensional electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) applied. comparing protein profiles myocardial mitochondria chronic restraint stress group control group, 11 protein spots found altered, seven identified MALDI-TOF MS. Among seven proteins, five proteins involved Krebs cycle lipid metabolism mitochondria decreased chronic restraint stress. identified carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase 1, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (NAD+) alpha, fumarate hydratase 1 pyruvate dehydrogenase beta. last two proteins, creatine kinase prohibitin, increased chronic restraint stress. Biochemical tests energy metabolism mitochondria also supported proteomic results. findings provide clues understanding mechanism dysfunction injury cardiomyocytes induced chronic stress.
