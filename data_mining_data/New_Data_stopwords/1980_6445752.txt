 Changes extra- intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios function respiratory state measured incubations rat liver mitochondria. ATPase creatine/creatine kinase used change extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio; separation mitochondrial pellet performed Millipore filtration technique. conditions tested, intramitochondrial ratio changed direction extramitochondrial one, except presence atractylate correlation observed. Furthermore, could shown oxygen uptake pyruvate carboxylase activity correlated intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio extramitochondrial one. results support proposal adenine nucleotide translocase rate limiting respiration.
