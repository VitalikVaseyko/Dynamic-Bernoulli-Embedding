 role played ADP modulating cross-bridge function difficult study, hard buffer ADP concentration skinned muscle preparations. solve this, used analog ADP, spin-labeled ADP (SL-ADP). SL-ADP binds tightly myosin poor substrate creatine kinase pyruvate kinase. Thus ATP regenerated, allowing well-defined concentrations ATP SL-ADP. measured isometric ATPase rate isometric tension function [SL-ADP], 0.1-2 mM, [ATP], 0.05-0.5 mM, skinned rabbit psoas muscle, simulating fresh fatigued states. Saturating levels SL-ADP increased isometric tension (by P'), absolute value P' nearly constant, approximately 0.04 N/mm(2), variable ATP levels, pH 7. Tension decreased (50-60%) pH 6, upon addition SL-ADP, P' still approximately 0.04 N/mm(2). ATPase inhibited competitively SL-ADP inhibition constant, K(i), approximately 240 280 microM pH 7 6, respectively. Isometric force ATPase activity could fit simple model cross-bridge kinetics.
