 effects insulin vitro perfused liver streptozotocin-diabetic rats untreated littermates gluconeogenesis either [3-13C]alanine + ethanol [2-13C]pyruvate + NH4Cl + ethanol studied 13C NMR. 13C NMR determination rate pyruvate kinase flux steady-state conditions active gluconeogenesis developed; assay includes check reuse recycled pyruvate. preparations studied provided gradations pyruvate kinase flux within confines assay's requirement active gluconeogenesis. determination, rate pyruvate kinase flux 0.74 +/- 0.04 gluconeogenic rate liver 24-h-fasted controls; liver 12-h-fasted controls, relative pyruvate kinase flux increased 1.0 +/- 0.2. diabetic liver, flux undetectable NMR method. Insulin's hepatic influence vitro greatest streptozotocin model type 1 diabetes: upon treatment diabetic liver 7 nM insulin vitro, partial reversal many differences noted diabetic control liver demonstrated 13C NMR. major effect insulin vitro upon diabetic liver induction large increase rate pyruvate kinase flux, bringing relative absolute fluxes levels measured 24-h-fasted controls. way comparison, effects ischemia diabetic liver studied 13C NMR test whether changes allosteric effectors conditions could also increase pyruvate kinase flux. large increase activity demonstrated ischemic diabetic liver.
