 Pyruvate kinase exhibits allosteric properties. allosteric effect fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) binding rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (PK) presence various ions (Mg(2+), Mn(2+), K(+), Na(+)) studied attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combination dialysis accessory. experiments indicated FBP binding causes conformational changes PK order magnitude PEP binding. conformational change PEP binding PK/Mg(2+)/K(+) presence FBP twice large absence, tentatively ascribed higher occupancy closed state. affinity PEP increased presence Mg(2+) K(+). effects observed ion combinations Mn(2+)/K(+) Mg(2+)/Na(+) D(2)O (with Mg(2+)/K(+)), therefore detect allosteric effect PEP binding conditions.
