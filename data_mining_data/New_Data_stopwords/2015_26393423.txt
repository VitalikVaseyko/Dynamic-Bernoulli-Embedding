 investigated whether altering Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis) treatment metabolic agent dichloroacetate (DCA) could increase X-ray-induced cell killing radiation-resistant human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines A549 H1299. Treatment 50mM DCA decreased lactate production glucose consumption A549 H1299, clear indications attenuated aerobic glycolysis. addition, found DCA treatment also slowed cell growth, increased population-doubling time, altered cell cycle distribution. Furthermore, report treatment 50mM DCA significantly increased single fractionated X-ray-induced cell killing A549 H1299 cells. Assay DNA double-strand break repair neutral comet assays demonstrated DCA inhibited fast slow kinetics X-ray-induced DSB repair A549 H1299 NSCL cancer cells. Taken together data suggest correlation attenuated aerobic glycolysis enhanced cytotoxicity radiation-induced cell killing radiation-resistant NSCLC cells.
