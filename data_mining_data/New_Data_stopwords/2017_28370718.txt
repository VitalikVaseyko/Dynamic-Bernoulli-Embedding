 Reprogramming glucose metabolism tumor cells referred Warburg effect results increased lactic acid secretion tumor microenvironment. previously shown lactic acid important roles pro-inflammatory immunosuppressive mediator promotes tumor progression. study, examined relationship lactic acid concentration expression LDHA GLUT1, related Warburg effect, human head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Tumors expressing lower levels LDHA GLUT1 higher concentration lactic acid higher LDHA GLUT1 expression. Lactic acid also suppressed expression LDHA GLUT1 vitro. previously reported lactic acid enhances expression M2 macrophage marker, ARG1, murine macrophages. Therefore, investigated relationship lactic acid concentration polarization M2 macrophages HNSCC measuring expression M2 macrophage markers, CSF1R CD163, normalized using pan-macrophage marker, CD68. Tumors lower levels CD68 showed higher concentration lactic acid, whereas higher levels CSF1R showed significantly higher concentration lactic acid. similar tendency observed CD163. results suggest tumor-secreted lactic acid linked reduction macrophages tumors promotes induction M2-like macrophage polarization human HNSCC.
