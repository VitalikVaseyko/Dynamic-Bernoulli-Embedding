 Tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate emtricitabine (FTC) used combination HIV treatment pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate prodrug undergoes diester hydrolysis TFV. FTC TFV nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors upon phosphorylation nucleotide triphosphate analogs competitively inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase. previously demonstrated adenylate kinase 2, pyruvate kinase, muscle pyruvate kinase, liver red blood cell phosphorylate TFV peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). identify kinases phosphorylate FTC PBMC, siRNAs targeted towards kinases phosphorylate compounds structurally similar FTC delivered PBMC, followed incubation FTC application matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry method well ultra high performance liquid chromatography-UV detect formation FTC phosphates. Knockdown deoxycytidine kinase decreased formation FTC-monophosphate, siRNA targeted towards thymidine kinase 1 decreased abundance FTC-diphosphate. Knockdown either cytidine monophosphate kinase 1 phosphoglycerate kinase 1 decreased abundance FTC-triphosphate. Next-generation sequencing genomic DNA isolated 498 HIV-uninfected participants HIV Prevention Trials Network 069/AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5305 clinical study, revealed 17 previously unreported genetic variants TFV FTC phosphorylating kinases. note, 4 individuals identified simultaneous carriers variants TFV FTC activating kinases. results identify specific kinases activate FTC PBMC, also providing insight potential genetic variation impact TFV FTC activation.
