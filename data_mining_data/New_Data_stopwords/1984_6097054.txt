 present investigation describes urinary output four different enzymes localized within nephron cells two models experimental acute renal failure. activities fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) pyruvate kinase (PK) determined urine rats maleate HgCl2 intoxication. 2 hours maleate intoxication urinary output FDP, GST NAG significantly increased control values. 6 hours HgCl2 poisoning FDP, GST NAG showed increased urinary enzyme activities. urinary activity enzyme significantly increased 24 hours intoxication. results good accordance damage observed light electron microscopic investigations carried experimental models. Furthermore, general problems urinary enzyme measurements discussed paper.
