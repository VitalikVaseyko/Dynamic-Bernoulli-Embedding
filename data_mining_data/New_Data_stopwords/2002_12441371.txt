 Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), chlorofluoroacetic acid (CFA), difluoroacetic acid (DFA) inhibitors pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA used clinical management congenital lactic acidosis. Glutathione transferase zeta (GSTZ1-1) catalyzes biotransformation DCA CFA, DCA mechanism-based inactivator GSTZ1-1. rodents, DCA causes multiorgan toxicities hepatocarcinogenic. toxic effects CFA, excellent substrate poor inactivator GSTZ1-1, investigated. objective study investigate nephrotoxicity CFA. Rats given single dose 1.5 mmol/kg CFA became anuric died within 24 h. Urinalysis light microscopic analysis showed rats given 0.6-1.2 mmol/kg CFA developed polyuria, glycosuria, renal proximal tubular damage. Electron microscopic analysis indicated role apoptosis CFA-induced cell death. nephrotoxicity CFA associated dose-dependent increase inorganic fluoride excretion. Treatment rats DCA 5 days inactivate GSTZ1-1 failed prevent metabolism CFA fluoride block CFA-induced renal damage. role GSTZ1-1-catalyzed release fluoride CFA proposed role enzymes cannot excluded. DFA, metabolized fluoride GSTZ1-1, given rats control also nephrotoxic: rats given 1.2 mmol DFA/kg/day 5 days normal urine volumes showed proximal distal tubular damage; fluoride excretion elevated. mechanism DFA-induced nephrotoxicity known appears differ CFA.
