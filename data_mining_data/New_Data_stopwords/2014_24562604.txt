 set structurally related Ru(eta(5)-C5H5) complexes bidentate N,N'-heteroaromatic ligands evaluated prospective metallodrugs, focus exploring uptake cell death mechanisms potential cellular targets. extended studies examine potential complexes target cancer cell metabolism, energetic-related phenotype cancer cells. observations complexes enter cells, probably facilitated binding plasma transferrin, retained preferentially membranes prompted us explore possible membrane targets involved cancer cell metabolism. malignant tumors present Warburg effect, consists increasing glycolytic rates production lactate, even presence oxygen. reliance glycolytic cancer cells trans-plasma-membrane electron transport (TPMET) systems continued survival raises question appropriateness target anticancer drug development strategies. Considering interesting findings anticancer drugs clinical use cytotoxic even without entering cells inhibit TPMET activity, investigated whether redox enzyme modulation could potential mechanism action antitumor ruthenium complexes. results study indicated ruthenium complexes inhibit lactate production TPMET activity way dependent cancer cell aggressiveness concentration complex. Combination approaches target cell metabolism (glycolytic inhibitors) well proliferation needed successfully cure cancer. study supports potential use ruthenium complexes adjuvants glycolytic inhibitors treatment aggressive cancers.
