 substrate specificity different forms polycation-stimulated (PCSH, PCSL, PCSC) phosphorylase phosphatases catalytic subunit MgATP-dependent protein phosphatase rabbit skeletal muscle investigated. done, phosphorylase reference substrate, using synthetic phosphopeptides patterned phosphorylated sites pyruvate kinase (type L) (Arg2-Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala (S2), Thr(32P) substitute (T4)), inhibitor-1 (Arg4-Pro-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T5), Arg2-Pro-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T1), Ser(32P) substitute (S1)), modified phosphopeptides (Arg2-Ala-Thr(32P)-Pro-Ala (T2) Arg2-Pro-Thr(32P)-Val-Ala (T3)), phosphorylated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. addition, casein(Thr-32P), phosphorylated casein kinase-2, also tested. PCS phosphatases show striking preference T4 configuration, PCSC least efficient. catalytic subunit MgATP-dependent phosphatase almost completely inactive toward substrates. shown PCSH phosphatase, comparing T4, two proline residues flanking Thr(P) T1 T5, inhibitor-1, drastically imparied dephosphorylation lowering Vmax affecting apparent Km. C-terminal proline (as T2) represents highly unfavorable factor dephosphorylation. critical effect sequence X-Thr(P)-Pro Pro-Thr(P)-Pro (T1, T2, T5, inhibitor-1) overcome manganese ions. additional finding case Pro-Ser(P)-Pro sequence (S1) suggests effect Mn2+ highly substrate specific. observations show considerable importance primary structure substrate determining specificity protein phosphatases.
