 Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) caused expansion CTG repeats 3' UTR DMPK gene. Expression CUG expansion (CUG(exp)) RNA produces toxic gain function disrupting functions RNA splicing factors, MBNL1 CELF1, leading splicing changes associated clinical abnormalities. Progressive skeletal muscle weakness wasting one prominent clinical features DM1; however, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. report embryonic M2 isoform pyruvate kinase (PKM2), key enzyme contributing Warburg effect cancer, significantly induced DM1 tissue mouse models owing aberrant splicing. Expression PKM2 DM1 skeletal muscle restricted type 1 fibers, particularly susceptible wasting DM1. Using antisense oligonucleotides shift PKM splicing toward increased PKM2 expression, observed increased glucose consumption reduced oxidative metabolism cell culture increased respiratory exchange ratio mice, suggesting defects energy metabolism conferred PKM2 expression. propose PKM2 expression induces changes type 1 fibers associated muscle atrophy muscle weakness DM1.
