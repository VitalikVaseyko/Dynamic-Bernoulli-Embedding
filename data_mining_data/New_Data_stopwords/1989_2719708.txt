 Human reticulocytes obtained patients suffering various haemolytic disorders convert exogenous [1-14C]-arachidonic acid 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13(Z,Z,Z,E)-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). Immunological studies (dot blot, Western blot) indicated human reticulocytes contain lipoxygenase cross-reacts polyclonal antiserum rabbit reticulocyte lipoxygenase. Northern blotting cloned lipoxygenase cDNA probe shows specific mRNA also present. Reaction lipoxygenase submitochondrial particles caused inactivation respiratory enzymes. occurrence erythroid cell specific lipoxygenase similar type reticulocytes various mammals man suggests general role enzyme maturational degradation mitochondria.
