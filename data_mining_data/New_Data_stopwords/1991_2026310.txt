 study investigates effects exogenous thyroxine (T4) running endurance, tissue masses, activities citrate synthase (CS), pyruvate kinase (PK), cytosolic alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH), beta-hydroxyacyl Coenzyme dehydrogenase (HOAD) Sceloporus undulatus (eastern fence lizard). enzymes assayed indicate maximal catabolic activities support exercise. Parallel experiments done captive field-active groups determine whether responses captive studies adequately predict responses nature. Exogenous T4 administered via intraperitoneal pellets. effect T4 running endurance dependent location experiment (P = 0.040) stamina increased T4 field-active lizards. lower levels biological organization, interactivity T4 experimental location evident less prevalent level whole animal, location effects occurred independent T4 treatment. Heart kidney masses significantly greater total hind leg muscle mass less captive field-active lizards. Thyroxine reduced liver mass locations kidney mass captive lizards. Mass-specific CS alpha-GPDH gastrocnemius muscle (mixed fiber type) HOAD heart lower captive field-active lizards; PK heart liver alpha-GPDH heart higher captive lizards. Thyroxine increased CS liver HOAD heart, decreased alpha-GPDH liver locations, decreased alpha-GPDH gastrocnemius captive lizards. effects T4 differed significantly experimental locations gastrocnemius muscle (T4 decreased PK captive lizards) liver (T4 increased PK field-active lizards decreased PK captive lizards). mechanistic basis differences stamina captive field-active placebo T4-treated lizards largely unexplained factors measured here, thus illustrating uncertainty predicting organismal performance lower level measurements. Nonetheless, T4 shown greater physiological activity field-active captive Sceloporus regard resting total daily metabolic rates running endurance. results study confirm endocrine experiments captive animals may predict responses nature. efforts clarify physiological significance seasonal variations levels thyroid hormones involve, least part, invasive studies field-active lizards.
