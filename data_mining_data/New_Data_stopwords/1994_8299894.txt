 Hepatocyte-like mhAT3F cells derived hepatoma transgenic mouse expressing SV40 large antigen control antithrombin III gene regulatory region (Antoine, B., Levrat, F., Vallet, V., Berbar, T., Cartier, N., Dubois, N., Briand, P., Kahn, A. (1992) Gene expression hepatocyte-like lines established targeted carcinogenesis transgenic mice. Exp. Cell. Res. 200, 175-185; F. Levrat et al., unpublished results). cells, L-PK gene transcriptionally activated glucose, vivo cultured hepatocytes. However, contrast L-PK gene regulation liver isolated hepatocytes, glucose responsiveness require insulin blocked cyclic AMP. mhAT3F cells, insensitivity insulin might due replacement insulin-dependent glucokinase insulin-independent hexokinases able phosphorylate glucose absence hormone. glucose-dependent activation L-PK gene delayed, requires ongoing protein synthesis, mediated glucose response element vivo isolated hepatocytes. results suggest glucose-dependent signaling pathway responsible transcriptional activation glycolytic lipogenic genes requires glucose phosphorylation, phenomenon insulin-dependent liver insulin-independent cultured hepatoma cells. Nevertheless, action glucose 6-phosphate likely indirect.
