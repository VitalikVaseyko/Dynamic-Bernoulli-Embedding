 decades, recognized cancer cells display unique metabolism; specifically, cancer cells shown preferentially utilize glycolysis instead mitochondrial respiration. phenomenon commonly known "Warburg effect" Otto Warburg first made observation 1927. discovery Warburg effect lead new methods detection differentiation cancerous tissue normal tissue. recently, alterations cancer metabolism researched possible target chemotherapeutic intervention number cancers. push understand metabolism cancer cells particularly acute breast cancer cells, multiple novel metabolic mechanisms recently described characterized. However, despite recent progress, completion additional studies cellular metabolism breast cancer cells necessary drugs target cancer cell metabolism could available disease-afflicted women. Here, review recent discoveries breast cancer cell metabolism well current logical drug targets could used alter cell metabolism promote selective elimination breast cancer cells.
