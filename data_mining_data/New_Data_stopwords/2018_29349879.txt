 study's purposes diagnose intractable hemolytic anemia provide guiding treatment affected family members. performed NGS panel 600 genes blood diseases patient obscure hemolytic anemia parents. confirmed diagnosis pyruvate kinase deficiency, identified novel homozygous mutation PKLR gene (NM_000298: exon 6: c.T941C: p.I314T), ruled blood diseases Chinese family. Furthermore, amniotic fluid taken mother second trimester, DNA extracted analyze type PKLR gene mutation. proband received cord blood bone marrow second child mother hematopoietic stem cell transplantation achieved normal hematopoiesis. genetic characterization analysis genotype-phenotype correlation study PKLR gene suggested NGS effective method confirm molecular diagnosis intractable hemolytic anemia. identification mutation aided prenatal diagnosis second pregnancy effective clinical management affected family.
