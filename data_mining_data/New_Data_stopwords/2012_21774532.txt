 Phosphopeptide binding domains mediate directed localized assembly protein complexes essential intracellular kinase signaling. identify phosphopeptide binding proteins, developed proteomic screening method using immobilized partially degenerate phosphopeptide mixtures combined SILAC microcapillary LC-MS/MS. method used identify proteins specifically bound phosphorylated peptide library affinity matrices, including pTyr, motifs pSer/pThr-Pro, pSer/pThr-X-X-X-pSer/pThr, pSer/pThr-Glu/Asp, pSer/pThr-pSer/pThr degenerate sequence contexts. Heavy light SILAC lysates applied columns containing phosphorylated nonphosphorylated (control) peptide libraries respectively, bound proteins eluted, combined, digested, analyzed LC-MS/MS using hybrid quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer. Heavy/light peptide ion ratios calculated, peptides yielded ratios greater approximately 3:1 considered potential phosphopeptide binding proteins since ratio represents lowest ratio known positive control. Many identified known phosphopeptide-binding proteins, including SH2 domain containing p85 subunit PI3K bound pTyr, 14-3-3 bound pSer/pThr-Asp/Glu, polo-box domain containing PLK1 Pin1 bound pSer/pThr-Pro, pyruvate kinase M2 binding pTyr. Approximately half hits identified peptide library screens novel. Protein domain enrichment analysis revealed pTyr hits contain SH2 domains, expected, lesser extent SH3, C1, STAT, Tyr phosphatase, Pkinase, C2, PH domains; however, pSer/pThr motifs reveal enriched domains across hits.
