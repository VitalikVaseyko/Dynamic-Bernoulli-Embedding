 thermogenic activation, brown adipocytes take large amounts glucose. addition, cold stimulation leads upregulation glycolytic enzymes. investigated importance glycolysis brown adipocyte glucose consumption thermogenesis. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown mature adipocytes, explored effect glucose transporters glycolytic enzymes brown adipocyte functions consumption glucose oxygen. Basal oxygen consumption brown adipocytes equally dependent glucose fatty acid oxidation, whereas isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated respiration fueled mainly fatty acids, significant contribution glucose oxidation. Knockdown glucose transporters brown adipocytes impaired ISO-stimulated glycolytic flux also oxygen consumption. Diminishing glycolytic flux knockdown first final enzyme glycolysis, i.e., hexokinase 2 (HK2) pyruvate kinase (PKM), respectively, decreased glucose uptake ISO-stimulated oxygen consumption. HK2 knockdown severe effect, which, contrast PKM knockdown, could rescued supplementation pyruvate. Hence, brown adipocytes rely glucose consumption glycolytic flux achieve maximum thermogenic output, glycolysis likely supporting thermogenesis pyruvate formation also supplying intermediates efferent metabolic pathways.
