 precise mitochondrial alterations underlie increased dependence cancer cells aerobic glycolysis energy generation remained mystery. Recent evidence suggests mitochondrial uncoupling-the abrogation ATP synthesis response mitochondrial membrane potential-promotes Warburg effect leukemia cells, may contribute chemoresistance. Intriguingly, leukemia cells cultured bone marrow-derived stromal feeder layers resistant chemotherapy, increase expression uncoupling protein 2, decrease entry pyruvate Krebs cycle-without compromising consumption oxygen, suggesting shift oxidation nonglucose carbon sources maintain mitochondrial integrity function. fatty acid oxidation linked chemoresistance mitochondrial uncoupling, tempting speculate Warburg's observations may indeed result preferential oxidation fatty acids cancer cell mitochondria. Therefore, targeting fatty acid oxidation anaplerotic pathways support fatty acid oxidation may provide additional therapeutic tools treatment hematopoietic malignancies.
