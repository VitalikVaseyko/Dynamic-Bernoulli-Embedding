 BACKGROUND: Cancer cells different metabolic profile compared normal cells. Warburg effect (increased aerobic glycolysis) glutaminolysis (increased mitochondrial activity glutamine catabolism) well known hallmarks cancer accompanied increased lactate production, hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane increased production reactive oxygen species. METHODS: study target Warburg effect dichloroacetate (DCA) increased mitochondrial activity glutaminolysis arsenic trioxide (ATO) breast cancer cells, measuring cell proliferation, cell death mitochondrial characteristics. RESULTS: combination DCA ATO effective inhibiting cell proliferation inducing cell death either drug alone. examined effect treatments mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production ATP levels identified new molecular mechanisms within mitochondria ATO DCA: ATO reduces mitochondrial function inhibition cytochrome C oxidase (complex IV electron transport chain) DCA up-regulates ATP synthase beta subunit expression. potentiation ATO cytotoxicity DCA correlated strong suppression expression c-Myc HIF-1alpha, decreased expression survival protein Bcl-2. CONCLUSION: study first demonstrate targeting two key metabolic hallmarks cancer effective anti-cancer strategy therapeutic potential.
