 Tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) instrumental aerobic glycolysis gene transcription. PKM2 regulates G1-S phase transition controlling cyclin D1 expression. However, known whether PKM2 directly controls cell-cycle progression. show PKM2, PKM1, binds spindle checkpoint protein Bub3 mitosis phosphorylates Bub3 Y207. phosphorylation required Bub3-Bub1 complex recruitment kinetochores, interacts Blinkin essential correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment, mitotic/spindle-assembly checkpoint, accurate chromosome segregation, cell survival proliferation, active EGF receptor-induced brain tumorigenesis. addition, level Bub3 Y207 phosphorylation correlated histone H3-S10 phosphorylation human glioblastoma specimens glioblastoma prognosis. findings highlight role PKM2 protein kinase controlling fidelity chromosome segregation, cell-cycle progression, tumorigenesis.
