 Extracts wild-type strain Neurospora crassa, electrophoresed SDS-polyacrylamide gels electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets, hybridized end-labelled pyruvate kinase (PK) gene fragment containing 5' noncoding sequence large part coding region. 30-kDa protein found bind strongly PK gene DNA, binding weakly plasmid pUC12 DNA total N. crassa DNA. Probing blots individual restriction fragments derived PK gene showed protein binding occurred primarily 5' noncoding region. Nonspecific DNA pUC12, PK gene DNA recombinant plasmid pNP460 (pUC12 containing 1.8-kilobase EcoRI insert PK gene DNA), along 0.7-kilobase EcoRI-AccI restriction fragment containing 5' flanking region, used filter-binding experiments analyze kinetics binding. Formation protein-DNA complexes demonstrated monitoring electrophoretic mobility fragment nondenaturing gels.
