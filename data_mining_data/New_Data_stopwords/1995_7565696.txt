 Transcription hepatocyte-specific genes requires interaction regulatory regions several nuclear factors. Among hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) family, composed HNF3 alpha, HNF3 beta, HNF3 gamma proteins, expressed liver similar fork head DNA binding domains. regulatory regions numerous hepatocyte-specific genes contain HNF3 binding sites. examined role HNF3 proteins liver-specific phenotype turning HNF3 activity well-differentiated mhAT3F hepatoma cells. Cells stably transfected vector allowing synthesis HNF3 beta fragment consisting fork head DNA binding domain without transactivating amino- carboxy-terminal domains. truncated protein located nuclei cultured hepatoma cells competed endogenous HNF3 proteins binding cognate DNA sites. Overproduction truncated protein, lacking transactivating activity, induced dramatic decrease expression liver-specific genes, including albumin, transthyretin, transferrin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, aldolase B, whereas expression L-type pyruvate kinase gene, containing HNF3 binding sites, unaltered. Neither concentrations various liver-specific transcription factors (HNF3, HNF1, HNF4, C/EBP alpha) affected. partial revertants, lower ratio truncated full-length endogenous HNF3 proteins, previously extinguished genes re-expressed. Thus, transactivating domains HNF3 proteins needed proper expression set liver-specific genes expression genes encoding transcription factors found differentiated hepatocytes.
