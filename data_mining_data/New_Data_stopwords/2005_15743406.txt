 1. present study designed examine role calcineurin muscle metabolic components administration specific calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine (CsA) rats. 2. Male Wistar rats divided either CsA-treated group (CT) vehicle-treated group (VT). Cyclosporine administered subcutaneously rats rate 25 mg/kg bodyweight per day 10 successive days. Thereafter, changes muscle enzyme activities glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1 MCT-4 proteins slow-twitch soleus fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles examined. 3. significant increase MCT-1 MCT-4 proteins soleus muscle CT group, EDL muscle. activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase soleus muscle also increased significantly CT group, similar increase enzyme activity seen EDL muscle. activities citrate synthase malate dehydrogenase GLUT-4 protein content altered CsA treatment either soleus EDL muscles. 4. results seem imply calcineurin negatively regulates components glucose/lactate metabolism, except GLUT-4, especially slow-twitch muscle.
