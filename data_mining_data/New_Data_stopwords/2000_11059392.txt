 influence thyroxine activity enzymes energy metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, laktate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome-c oxidase) antioxidative system (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase) neonatal piglet neutrophils investigated. found, durable injections hormone (4 mg/kg body weight) increase glycolytic enzymes activities well aerobic energy pathway catalyzers took place. Simultaneously augmentation superoxide dismutase reaction occurred thyroxine treatment. effect might represent important link compensatory mechanism, prevents destructive action reactive oxygen species.
