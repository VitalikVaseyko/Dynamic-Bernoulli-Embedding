 Mitochondrial protein phosphorylation well-recognized metabolic control mechanism, classical example pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) regulation specific kinases phosphatases bacterial origin. However, despite growing number reported mitochondrial phosphoproteins, identity protein kinases mediating phosphorylation events remains largely unknown. detection mitochondrial protein kinases complicated low concentration kinase relative target protein, lack specific antibodies, contamination associated, nonmatrix, proteins. study, use blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) isolate rat porcine heart mitochondrial complexes screening protein kinase activity. detect kinase activity, one-dimensional BN-PAGE gels exposed [gamma-(32)P]ATP followed sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Dozens mitochondrial proteins labeled (32)P setting, including five complexes oxidative phosphorylation several citric acid cycle enzymes. nearly ubiquitous (32)P protein labeling demonstrates protein kinase activity within mitochondrial protein complex. validity two-dimensional BN-PAGE method demonstrated detecting known PDH kinases phosphatases within PDH complex band using Western blots mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, approaches detected additional conventional protein kinases, suggesting major role autophosphorylation mitochondrial proteins. Studies purified Complex V creatine kinase confirmed proteins undergo autophosphorylation and, lesser degree, tenacious (32)P-metabolite association. In-gel Complex IV activity shown inhibited ATP, partially reversed phosphatase activity, consistent inhibitory role protein phosphorylation complex. Collectively, study proposes many mitochondrial complexes contain autophosphorylation mechanism, may play functional role regulation multiprotein units.
