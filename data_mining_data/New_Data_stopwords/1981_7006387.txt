 understanding molecular basis insulin actin remains incomplete, important new insights achieved recently. available evidence date indicates intracellular signalling hormone results initial interaction specific cell surface receptors. Insulin receptors tissues studied date appear minimally composed two Mr 125,000 subunits denoted alpha two Mr 90,000 subunits denoted beta. beta subunit extremely sensitive proteolytic cleavage near center amino acid chain. four subunits linked together disulfide bonds give symmetrical configuration stoichiometry (alpha-s-s-beta)-s-s-(alpha-s-s-beta). structure remarkably similar general subunit composition immunoglobulin G molecules provides structural basis postulate minimum insulin receptor structure may divalent binding hormone. second area recent progress involves successful generation soluble factor factors insulin capable modulating activity insulin-sensitive enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase, glycogen synthase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase cell-free systems. Indirect evidence indicates putative mediator mediators insulin action exhibits properties expected low molecular weight peptide, including destruction proteases. data available consistent hypothesis insulin-receptor interaction leads activation membrane protease catalyzes release peptide mediator mediators insulin action.
