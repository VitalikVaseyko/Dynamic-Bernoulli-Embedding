 Schizophrenia (SCZ) result DNA alterations environmental factors, together lead differential protein expression ultimately development illness. diagnosis based clinical symptoms, molecular background SCZ completely understood. thalamus, whose dysfunction associated SCZ based diverse lines evidences, plays instance pivotal role central nervous system relay center re-distributing auditory visual stimuli diverse brain regions cerebral cortex. analyzed proteome postmortem mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) samples 11 SCZ patients 8 non-SCZ individuals using quantitative shotgun-mass spectrometry two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. analyses identified 551 proteins, 50 showed significant differential expression. main pathways affected differentially expressed proteins include energy metabolism, oligodendrocyte metabolism, cytoskeleton assembly. potential protein biomarkers candidates myelin basic protein myelin oligodendrocyte protein validated Western blot MDT samples also cerebrospinal fluid separate set samples 17 first-episode SCZ patients 10 healthy controls. differential expression mu-crystallin, protein kinase C-gamma, glial fibrillary acidic protein confirmed MDT. found several glycolysis enzymes differentially expressed, measured levels pyruvate NADPH found altered MDT. protein changes described corroborate importance myelin/oligodendrocyte energy metabolism SCZ highlight new potential biomarkers candidates may contribute understanding pathogenesis complex disease.
