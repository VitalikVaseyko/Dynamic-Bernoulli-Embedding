 myc(-/-) rat fibroblasts (KO cells) differ myc(+/+) (WT) cells KO cells enforced Myc re-expression (KO-Myc cells) respect mitochondrial structure function, utilization glucose glutamine energy-generating substrates, ATP levels. Specifically, KO cells demonstrate low levels glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, dysfunctional mitochondria electron transport chain complexes, depleted ATP stores. examined cells adapt energy-deficient state differ uptake utilization long- medium-chain fatty acids palmitate octanoate, respectively. Metabolic tracing molecules showed KO cells preferentially utilize beta-oxidation substrates that, rather directing phospholipids, preferentially store neutral lipids. KO cell transcriptional profiling functional assays revealed generalized up-regulation pathways involved fatty acid transport catabolism well evidence cells attempt direct acetyl-CoA tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ATP production rather utilizing anabolic purposes. Additional evidence support idea included finding AMP-dependent protein kinase constitutively activated KO cells. complex control pyruvate dehydrogenase, links glycolysis TCA cycle, also maximized ensure conversion pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Despite efforts maximize acetyl-CoA energy-generating purposes, levels remained chronically low KO cells. suggests tumor cells Myc deregulation might susceptible novel therapies limit acetyl-CoA availability.
