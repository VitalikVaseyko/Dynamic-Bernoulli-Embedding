 intestinal metabolism glucose glutamine studied rats made septic cecal ligation puncture technique. Sepsis resulted negative nitrogen balance produced increases concentrations blood pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glutamine, decreases 3-hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate. plasma insulin glucagon concentrations increased 2.2- 3.2-fold septic rats, respectively. Portal-drained visceral blood flow increased septic rats, accompanied decrease rates utilization glutamine production lactate, glutamate, ammonia compared rates sham-operated animals. Enterocytes isolated septic rats showed decreased rates glucose glutamine utilization compared cells isolated corresponding controls. maximal activities hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glutaminase decreased intestinal mucosal scrapings septic rats. concluded moderate form sepsis decreases rates glucose glutamine utilization (both vivo vitro) epithelial cells small intestine. may caused changes maximal activities key enzymes pathways glucose glutamine metabolism cells metabolic adaptation spare glucose glutamine use tissues.
