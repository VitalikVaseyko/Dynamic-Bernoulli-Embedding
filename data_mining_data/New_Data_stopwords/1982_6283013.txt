 concentrations glycolytic intermediates ATP activities certain glycolytic gluconeogenic enzymes determined Propionibacterium shermanii cultures grown fully defined medium glucose, glycerol lactate energy source. three energy sources, enzyme activities similar pyruvate kinase considerably active gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase, indicating need regulation pyruvate kinase activity. intracellular concentration glucose 6-phosphate, specific activator pyruvate kinase organism, changed markedly according nature concentration growth substrate: concentration (7-10 mM) growth excess glucose glycerol higher (1-2 mM) growth lactate growth-limiting concentrations glycerol glucose. glycolytic intermediates, apart pyruvate, present concentrations 2 mM. Glucose 6-phosphate overcame inhibition pyruvate kinase activity ATP inorganic phosphate. 1 mM-ATP 10 mM inorganic phosphate, change glucose 6-phosphate concentration 1-2 mM sufficient switch pyruvate kinase strongly inhibited fully active state. results provide plausible mechanism regulation glycolysis gluconeogenesis P. shermanii.
