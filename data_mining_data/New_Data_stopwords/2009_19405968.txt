 BACKGROUND: growing number realistic silico models metabolic functions formulated serve 'dry lab' platforms prototype simulate experiments performed. example, dual perturbation experiments vary genetic environmental parameters readily simulated silico. Genetic environmental perturbations applied cell-scale model human erythrocyte subsequently investigated. RESULTS: resulting steady state fluxes concentrations, well dynamic responses perturbations analyzed, yielding two important conclusions: 1) transporters informative internal states (fluxes concentrations) cell and, 2) genetic variations disrupt natural sequence dynamic interactions network components. former arises adjustments energy redox states, latter result shifting time scales aggregate pool formation metabolites. two concepts illustrated glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) pyruvate kinase (PK) human red blood cell. CONCLUSION: Dual perturbation experiments silico much informative characterization functional states single perturbations. Predictions experimentally validated cellular model metabolism indicate measurement cofactor precursor transport rates inform internal state cell external demands altered causal genetic variation introduced. Finally, genetic mutations alter clinical phenotype may also disrupt 'natural' time scale hierarchy interactions network.
