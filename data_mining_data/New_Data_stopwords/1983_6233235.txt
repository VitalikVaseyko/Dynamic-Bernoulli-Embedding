 Oxalic, succinic, glutaric pimelic acid (5 mM) effect lactate formation glucose added crude extract chicken embryo time substrate cofactors; conversely malonic, adipic, suberic, azelaic sebacic acid inhibitory effect ranging 20% 35%. enzyme preparation pre-incubated dicarboxylic acids one hour beginning experiments, compounds tested, exception succinate, inhibited anaerobic glycolysis. Hexokinase activity significantly reduced saturated dicarboxylic acids C3 C10, oxalic acid. Phosphofructokinase inhibited oxalic, pimelic suberic acid. Pyruvate kinase appeared sensitive oxalic acid (64% inhibition).
