 Using rainbow trout hepatocytes stimulated l-leucine, l-methionine, l-lysine presence absence bovine insulin, investigated ability amino acids mimic effects pool amino acids protein kinase B (Akt)/target rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways expression 6 genes known subjected insulin and/or amino acid regulation [glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), serine dehydratase (SDH)]. Emphasis placed leucine, known signaling molecule mammals, methionine lysine essential amino acids limiting plant-based diets fish. presence insulin, leucine (but methionine lysine) phosphorylated Akt ribosomal protein S6 previously observed pool amino acids, suggesting leucine might participate activation TOR pathway amino acids fish, mammals. G6Pase, PEPCK, GK, SDH gene expression higher leucine-treated cells compared control cells. Leucine combined insulin reduced G6Pase gene expression 90% increased FAS gene expression > 4-fold compared control treatment. Methionine weakly decreased G6Pase, GK, SDH gene expression lysine weakly significantly decreased mRNA level PEPCK. Thus, leucine regulated gluconeogenesis lipogenesis, glycolysis, way pool amino acids. Methionine appeared involved regulation specific genes, whereas lysine limited effects. findings particularly relevant regarding involvement amino acids regulation metabolism-related gene expression.
