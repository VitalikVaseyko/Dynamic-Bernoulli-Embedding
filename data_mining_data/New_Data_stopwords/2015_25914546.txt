 BACKGROUND: well known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) plays important role tissue energy metabolism. However, roles PGC-1alpha malignant endometrial cancer remain unknown. METHODS: Forty cases endometrial carcinoma, 15 cases proliferative endometrial tissues, 21 cases normal endometrial tissues collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction used detect mRNA levels PGC-1alpha estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma). ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) used detect concentrations pyruvate kinase isocitrate dehydrogenase. results analyzed using medical statistical methods. RESULTS: mRNA levels PGC-1alpha ERRgamma endometrial carcinoma tissues hyperplasic endometrial tissues significantly greater normal endometria. mRNA levels PGC-1alpha ERRgamma endometrial carcinoma patients type 2 diabetes higher patients without diabetes. mRNA levels PGC-1alpha ERRgamma endometrial adenocarcinomas increased clinical staging, depth myometrial invasion, increases number metastatic lymph nodes. PGC-1alpha mRNA level positively correlated ERRgamma endometrial carcinoma tissues. mRNA levels PGC-1alpha positively correlated concentrations pyruvate kinase isocitrate dehydrogenase endometrial carcinoma tissues, similar results found ERRgamma. CONCLUSION: results suggested upregulation PGC-1alpha ERRgamma endometrial cancer might requirement cancer cell energy metabolism, contributes development endometrial cancer.
