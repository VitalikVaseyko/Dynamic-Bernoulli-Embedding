 WI-38 cells synchronized mitotic collection periodically assayed pyruvate kinase activity. kinetics synchronous cohort determined continuous labelling index mitotic index. experimental data analysed computer using state vector model yield probability density functions phase transit times cell physiological ages. Pyruvate kinase activity cells function physiological age examined using computer model. Considering DNA synthesis, pyruvate kinase activity mitosis markers physiological age, found model assumes cohort synchronized cells desynchronizes irreversibly uniformly one age marker next incompatible experimental data. example, times cells entered phase widely distributed consistent mitotic index data. Also, pyruvate kinase activity function physiological age alone, cell ages probably dispersed compatible experimental enzyme data. Alternative models cell physiological ageing presented, compatible experimental data.
