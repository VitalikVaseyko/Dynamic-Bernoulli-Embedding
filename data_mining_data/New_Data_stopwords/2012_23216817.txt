 Angiogenic endothelial cells tumour cells survive hypoxic conditions even proliferate migrate low-oxygen environment. cell types, high rates glycolysis (i.e. conversion glucose lactate) glutaminolysis provide required biosynthetic intermediates energy support sprouting cell division without coupling oxidative phosphorylation. metabolic preference observed hypoxic conditions, also situations oxygen present. case tumour cells, known Warburg effect largely governed oncogenes. endothelial cells lining tumour blood vessels, option respiration-independent metabolism allows neovasculature resist hostile environment fluctuating oxygen tension (ranging severe hypoxia quasi-normal levels oxygen). addition, accumulation tumours lactate, end-product glycolysis, largely contributes angiogenic phenotype inhibition prolyl hydroxylase 2 activation HIF1alpha NFkappaB. Activation latter hypoxia-independent manner leads increased production interleukin-8/CXCL8 drives autocrine stimulation endothelial cell proliferation maturation neovessels. conclusion, addiction proliferating endothelial cells glucose glutamine fuels driving force lactate promote angiogenesis provide novel potential treatment options without disadvantages conventional anti-angiogenic drugs.
