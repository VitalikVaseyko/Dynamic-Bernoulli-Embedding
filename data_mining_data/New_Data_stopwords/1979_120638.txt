 peripheral arrangements intra-cytoplasmic membranes (ICM) well guanine + cytosine (G + C) content 63% indicate obligate methanotrophic strain 102 would belong type II Methylotrophs. active transport mechanisms organic additives, known stimulate CO2-fixation. CO2-acceptor molecules, Pyr (pyruvate) PEP (phospho-enolpyruvate), must metabolically intracellularly furnished. one carboxylating system could induced cell fractions. carboxylating activities variably registered cell-free extracts fragments. Indications site carboxylating activities ICM discussed. fact CO2-fixation intensities decreased middle active growing phase indicates formation intermediate C4-compound OAA (oxaloacetate) must furnished reactions by-passing PEP-carboxylation step. common serine-pathway C1-assimilation rearranged fit discussed findings.
