 Isolated hepatocytes 24 h starved chicks depleted phosphate incubated presence 32P-orthophosphate. Pyruvate kinase type M2 crude cell extracts partially purified chromatography DEAE-Sephacel hydroxylapatite. SDS slab gel electrophoresis fractions containing enzyme immunoprecipitation antisera showed phosphorylation pyruvate kinase type M2. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified serine phosphate acceptor.
