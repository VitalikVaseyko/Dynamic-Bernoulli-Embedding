 Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium, L-threonine cleaved non-oxidatively propionate via 2-ketobutyrate biodegradative threonine deaminase, 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase (or pyruvate formate-lyase), phosphotransacetylase propionate kinase. anaerobic condition, L-threonine converted energy-rich keto acid subsequently catabolised produce ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, providing source energy cells. enzymes involved degradation L-threonine propionate encoded anaerobically regulated tdc operon. recent past, extensive structural biochemical studies carried enzymes various groups. Besides detailed structural functional insights, studies also shown similarities differences related enzymes present metabolic network. paper, review structural biochemical studies carried enzymes.
