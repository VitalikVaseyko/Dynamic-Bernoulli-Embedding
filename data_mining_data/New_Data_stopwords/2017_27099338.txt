 Lysine acetylation tightly coupled nutritional status cell, availability cofactor, acetyl-CoA, fluctuates changing metabolic conditions. Recent studies demonstrated acetyl-CoA levels act indicator cellular nourishment, increased abundance metabolite block induction cellular recycling programmes. present study investigated cross-talk mitochondrial metabolic pathways, acetylation autophagy, using chemical inducers mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production. Treatment cells alpha-lipoic acid (alphaLA), cofactor pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, led unexpected hyperacetylation alpha-tubulin cytosol. acetylation blocked pharmacological inhibition mitochondrial citrate export (a source mitochondria-derived acetyl-CoA cytosol), dependent alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase (alphaTAT) coupled loss function cytosolic histone deacetylase, HDAC6. demonstrate alphaLA slows flux substrates autophagy-related pathways, severely limits ability cells remove depolarized mitochondria PTEN-associated kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated mitophagy.
