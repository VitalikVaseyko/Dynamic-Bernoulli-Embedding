 dry powder plant aereal part; Cupressus macro-carpa (Cupressacea) tested Biomphalaria alexandrina. LC50 & LC90 values 59.5 & 98.8 ppm, respec-tively. Exposure B. alexandrina sublethal concentrations (LC0, LC10 & LC25) C. macrocarpa three weeks signi-ficantly decreased number circulating hemocytes. magnitude reduction increased increasing tested concentration. main type cell hemolymph B. alexandrina granulocyte (71.8%), followed large round cells hyalinocytes (19.0%) small round cells undifferentiate cells (9.2%). percentage different hemocyte categories changed treated snails. snails maintained LC25, showed significantly higher percentages small round cells controls, 56.2% & 9.2% respectively. Maintainence B. alexandrina sublethal concentrations three weeks significantly reduced protein & hemoglobin content hemolymph. Reduction enzyme activities occurred hemolymph tissues treated snails. enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK), lactat dehydrogenase (LDH), hexokinase (HK) phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) important metabolism protein carbohydrate. infectivity Schistosoma mansoni miracidia greatly reduced exposure sublethal concentrations (LC0, LC10 & LC25) Cupressus. Infection rate B. alexandrina reached 54.5%, 37.5% & 16.7%, respectively compared control (81.25%). Duration cercarial shedding total periodic cercarial production/snail showed significant reduction parasite incubation period significantly longer (p<0.05).
