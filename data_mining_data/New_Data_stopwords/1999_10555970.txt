 interaction pyruvate kinase skeletal (SKPK) smooth (SMPK) muscle MM-creatine kinase (MMCK) BB-creatine kinase (BBCK) assessed using temporal absorbance changes, variations absorbance different wavelengths, concentration dependence, association electric field, PK kinetic activity. SKPK exhibits time course absorbance increase presence MMCK time constant 29.5 min. increase occurs wavelength 240 1000 nm. 195 nm, combination SKPK MMCK produces decrease absorption electric fields 0 204 V/cm. change SKPK-MMCK saturable. SKPK activity significantly increased presence MMCK solutions 0-32% ethanol. results indicate specific SKPK-MMCK interaction. SMPK BBCK exhibit similar coupling BBCK concentration dependence absorbance SMPK activity solutions 0-32% ethanol determined. MMCK BBCK increased SKPK activity; neither MMCK BBCK increased SMPK activity. ability form diazymatic complexes creatine kinase appears reside SKPK. coupling may account increased flux PK without significant substrate changes seen skeletal muscle activation. coupling occur smooth muscle.
