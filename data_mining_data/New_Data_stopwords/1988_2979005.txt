 Several studies performed structure muscle pyruvate kinase. X-ray diffraction provided three-dimensional picture active site, chemical modification studies revealed essential amino acid residues substrate binding catalysis. shown 8-azido-ADP (N3 ADP) behaves photoaffinity label enzyme. reagent upon irradiation produces inactivation enzyme, activity loss protected nucleotides. partially modified enzyme shows Km ADP native one suggesting "all none" inactivation effect. incorporation 1 mole 14C-N3 ADP per subunit correlates complete inactivation. radioactive peptide isolated enzyme labeled 14C-N3 ADP. partial sequence peptide showed corresponds peptide isolated rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase labeled dialdehyde-ADP trinitrobenzenesulfonate. peptide identical region cat chicken muscle enzymes, also high degree homology found region rat liver yeast enzymes. studies show N3 ADP binds site dialdehyde-ADP rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, site seems nucleotide binding site.
