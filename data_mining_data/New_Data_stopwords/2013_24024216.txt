 last decade, development anticancer therapies focused targeting neoplastic-related metabolism. Cancer cells display variety changes metabolism, enable satisfy high bioenergetic biosynthetic demands rapid cell division. One crucial alterations referred "Warburg effect", involves metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation towards less efficient glycolysis, independent presence oxygen. Although many examples solid tumors altered metabolism high rates glucose uptake glycolysis, recently reported phenomenon occurs hematological malignancies. review presents evidence targeting glycolytic pathway different levels hematological malignancies inhibit cancer cell proliferation restoring normal metabolic conditions. However, achieve cancer regression, high concentrations glycolytic inhibitors used due limited solubility biodistribution, may result toxicity. Besides using inhibitors monotherapies, combinatorial approaches using standard chemotherapeutic agents could display enhanced efficacy eradicating malignant cells. identification metabolic enzymes critical hematological cancer cell proliferation survival appears interesting new approach targeted therapy hematological malignancies.
