 Brest harbor (Bay Brest, Brittany, France) severe past anthropogenic chemical contamination, inputs tended decrease, indicating reassessment ecotoxicological status carried out. Here, native caged mussels (Mytilus spp.) used combination evaluate biological effects chronic chemical contamination Brest harbor. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination measured mussel tissues proxy harbor urban pollution. Biochemical biomarkers xenobiotic biotransformation, antioxidant defenses, generation reducing equivalents, energy metabolism oxidative damage studied gills digestive glands native caged mussels. particular, activities glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP), pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) measured lipid peroxidation assessed malondialdehyde (MDA) quantification. addition, condition index calculated assess overall health mussels. Moderate PAH contamination detected digestive glands native caged individuals exposed site. Modulations biomarkers detected digestive glands native harbor mussels indicating presence chemical pressure. particular, results suggested increased biotransformation (GST), antioxidant defenses (CAT), NADPH generation (IDP) gluconeogenesis (PEPCK), could represent coordinated response chemically-induced cellular stress. Lipid peroxidation assessment condition index indicated absence acute stress mussels suggesting metabolic changes could, least partially, offset negative effects contamination. caged mussels, GR found modulated compared non-exposed mussels significant differences oxidative stress energy-related biomarkers observed compared native harbor mussels. Overall, results suggested mussels chronically exposed contamination set metabolic adaptation, may contribute survival moderately contaminated harbor Brest. Whether adaptive traits result phenotypic plasticity genetic adaptation needs investigated.
