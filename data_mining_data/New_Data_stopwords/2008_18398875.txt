 present first proteomic analysis cellular responses avian influenza virus (H9N2) infection human cell line different time courses order search target proteins viral pathogenesis/adaptation studies. using 2-DE coupled MALDI-TOF MS nano-ESI-MS/MS, identified set differentially expressed cellular proteins, including cytoplasmic actin, cytokeratin, prohibitin, enoyl-CoA hydratase, peptide-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase A), chloride intracellular channel protein 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, elongation factor 1-beta splicing factor, arginine/serine rich 1. significant changes different time courses found cytoplasmic actin cytokeratin, constituted major components cytoskeleton network cells. obtained data suggested possible role cytoskeleton avian influenza virus infection mammalian cells, might help better understanding dynamics avian influenza virus host interaction mammalian cell setting.
