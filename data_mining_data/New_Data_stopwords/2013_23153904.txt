 BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure hyperglycaemic conditions shown detrimental effects beta cell function. resulting glucotoxicity contributing factor development type 2 diabetes. objective study combine metabolomics approach functional assays gain insight mechanism glucotoxicity exerts effects. METHODS: BRIN-BD11 INS-1E beta cell lines cultured 25 mM glucose 20 h mimic glucotoxic effects. PDK-2 protein expression, intracellular glutathione levels change mitochondrial membrane potential intracellular calcium following glucose stimulation determined. Metabolomic analysis beta cell metabolite extracts performed using GC-MS, 1H NMR 13C NMR. RESULTS: Conditions mimic glucotoxicity established resulted loss cellular viability either cell line causing decrease insulin secretion. Metabolomic analysis beta cells following exposure high glucose revealed change amino acids, increase glucose decrease phospho-choline, n-3 n-6 PUFAs glucose stimulated insulin secretion relative cells cultured control conditions. However, changes calcium handling mitochondrial membrane potential evident. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate decrease TCA cycle metabolism combination alteration fatty acid composition phosphocholine levels may play role glucotoxicity induced impairment glucose stimulated insulin secretion. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations certain metabolic pathways play role glucotoxicity pancreatic beta cell.
