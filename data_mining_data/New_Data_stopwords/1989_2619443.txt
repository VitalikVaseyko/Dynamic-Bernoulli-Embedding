 Long-time effects Cd carbohydrate metabolism investigated male Wistar rats. dose 0.3 mg/kg body weight Cd acetate form subcutaneously injected experimental animals twice week 3 months. Selected enzyme activities glycolysis well concentrations glycogen, glucose, pyruvate, lactate, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFA) determined blood serum, muscles, liver, fatty tissues. experimental animals differed control group, Cd intoxication followed decline blood serum pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities. liver, however, enzyme activities reduced. Glycogen glucose FFA levels increased. Intramuscular alterations found depend fibre type. severest disturbance glycolysis recordable red long fibres, whereas rapid white fibres resistant. change FFA concentration may interpreted compensation impairment carbohydrate metabolism energy balance.
