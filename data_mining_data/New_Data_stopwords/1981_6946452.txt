 frequency enzyme deficiency variants, defined alleles whose products either absent almost devoid normal activity erythrocytes, determined nine erythrocyte enzymes 675 newborn infants approximately 200 adults. Examples type genetic abnormality, homozygous condition often associated significant health consequences, detected seven nine enzymes studied. Fifteen inherited enzyme deficiency variants 6142 determinations newborn population 5 variants 1809 determinations adults identified. Seven deficiency variants involved triosephosphate isomerase, frequency 0.01 newborn population. average frequency 2.4/1000 2-3 times frequency observed rare electrophoretic variants erythrocyte enzymes population.
