 Fundamental aberrations carbohydrate metabolism previously demonstrated focal hepatic lesions emerging early hepatocarcinogenesis induced rat liver limited oral administration (stop model) N-nitrosomorpholine. Using experimental approach, investigated quantitatively activity pyruvate kinase (PK), key enzyme glycolysis gluconeogenesis, individual preneoplastic neoplastic hepatic lesions, particularly glycogen storage foci, mixed cell foci, basophilic cell foci, hepatocellular adenomas carcinomas specific type preneoplastic hepatic lesion designated enzymatically hyperactive focus (EHF). focal lesions dissected freeze-dried tissue sections laser microdissection device. permits excision small foci measurement enzyme activities serial sections focus different substrate concentrations, thus enabling possible changes isoenzyme pattern detected. average, PK activity increased glycogen storage foci. Mixed cell foci showed nearly normal slightly decreased enzyme activity. However, pronounced reduction PK activity observed low glycogen basophilic foci basophilic hepatic tumors. exceptionally high PK activity found one glycogenotic adenoma. increased activity also observed EHF. results suggest reduction PK activity relatively late event sequence cellular changes leading glycogenotic foci hepatocellular carcinomas. drastic decrease enzyme activity occurs low glycogen basophilic cell populations develop glycogenotic foci later stages hepatocarcinogenesis.
