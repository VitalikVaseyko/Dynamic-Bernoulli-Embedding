 main precursor lactose synthesis, large amounts glucose required lactating dairy cows. Milk yield greatly depends mammary lactose synthesis due osmoregulatory property mammary uptake water. Thus, glucose availability mammary gland could potential regulator milk production. present study, effect glucose availability expression key genes involved synthesis milk fat, lactose glucose metabolism vitro investigated. Bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMEC) treated 12 h various concentrations glucose (2.5, 5, 10 20 mmol/L). higher concentrations glucose (10-20 mmol/L) affect mRNA expression acetyl-CoA carboxylase, diacyl glycerol acyl transferase, glycerol-3 phosphate acyl transferase alpha-lactalbumin, whereas fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 beta-1, 4-galactosyl transferase mRNA expression increased 10 mmol/L decreased 20 mmol/L. content lactose synthase increased increasing concentration glucose, addition highest value 20 mmol/L glucose. Moreover, increased glucose concentration stimulated activities pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, elevated energy status BMEC. Therefore, deduced increasing glucose availability, extra absorbed glucose partitioned entering synthesis milk fat lactose regulation mRNA expression key genes, promoting glucose metabolism glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway well energy status. results indicated sufficient availability glucose BMEC may promote glucose metabolism, affect synthesis milk composition.
