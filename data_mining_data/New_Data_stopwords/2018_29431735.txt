 skeleton emerged important regulator systemic glucose homeostasis, osteocalcin insulin representing prime mediators interplay bone energy metabolism. However, genetic evidence indicates osteoblasts influence global energy metabolism additional, yet unknown, mechanisms. Here, report constitutive postnatally induced deletion hypoxia signaling pathway component von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) skeletal osteolineage cells mice led high bone mass well hypoglycemia increased glucose tolerance, accounted osteocalcin insulin. vitro vivo data indicated Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed massively increased glucose uptake glycolysis associated upregulated HIF-target gene expression, resembling Warburg effect typifies cancer cells. Overall, glucose consumption skeleton increased mutant mice, revealed 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, glycemia levels correlated inversely level skeletal glucose uptake, pharmacological treatment glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), restored glucose metabolism Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells vitro, prevented development systemic metabolic phenotype mutant mice. Altogether, findings reveal novel link cellular glucose metabolism osteoblasts whole-body glucose homeostasis, controlled local hypoxia signaling skeleton.
