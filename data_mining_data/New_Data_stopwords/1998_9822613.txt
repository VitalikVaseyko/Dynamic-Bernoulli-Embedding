 Mutations hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) linked subtype 3 maturity-onset diabetes young (MODY3), characterized primary defect insulin secretion. role HNF-1alpha regulation pancreatic beta-cell function investigated. Gene manipulation allowed graded overexpression HNF-1alpha controlled dominant-negative suppression HNF-1alpha function insulinoma INS-1 cells. show HNF-1alpha essential insulin gene transcription, demonstrated pronounced decrease insulin mRNA expression insulin promoter activity dominant-negative conditions. expression genes involved glucose transport metabolism including glucose transporter-2 L-type pyruvate kinase also regulated HNF-1alpha. Loss HNF-1alpha function leads severe defects insulin secretory responses glucose leucine, resulting impaired glucose utilization mitochondrial oxidation. nutrient-evoked ATP production subsequent changes plasma membrane potential intracellular Ca2+ diminished suppression HNF-1alpha function. results suggest HNF-1alpha function essential maintaining insulin storage nutrient-evoked release. defective mitochondrial oxidation metabolic substrates causes impaired insulin secretion, indicating molecular basis diabetic phenotype MODY3 patients.
