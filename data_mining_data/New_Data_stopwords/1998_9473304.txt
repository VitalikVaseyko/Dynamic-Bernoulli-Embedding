 Gene expression aldolase B, important enzyme glucose fructose metabolism, regulated hormones. examined direct effects major hormones aldolase B gene expression rat primary cultured hepatocytes, comparison gene expression phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzyme gluconeogenesis. Insulin, dexamethasone, high concentration glucose increased aldolase B mRNA abundance hepatocytes. Glucagon strongly suppressed aldolase B gene expression, hormone canceled stimulative effects insulin, dexamethasone, high concentration glucose. Epinephrine thyroxine slightly reduced aldolase B mRNA abundance, hormones cancel stimulative effects insulin dexamethasone. contrary, expression PEPCK gene suppressed insulin, dexamethasone, high concentration glucose, remarkably induced glucagon. Glucagon rapidly suppressed aldolase B gene expression transcriptional level. Forskolin dibutyryl cAMP mimicked suppressive effect glucagon aldolase B gene expression. results suggest glucagon may key regulator aldolase B gene transcription cAMP/protein kinase A-signaling pathway.
