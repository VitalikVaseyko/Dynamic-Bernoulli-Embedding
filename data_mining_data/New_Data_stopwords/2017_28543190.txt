 study aims explore effects shRNA-mediated silencing Pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) gene aerobic glycolysis colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. CRC tissues adjacent normal tissues obtained 136 patients diagnosed qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed detect mRNA protein expressions PKM2. CRC cells divided blank, vector, PKM2-shRNA groups. Hexokinase (HK) PKM2 activity determined glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) coupled colorimetric assay enzyme coupling rate method. extracellular lactate concentration measured ultraviolet spectrophotometer caspase activity measured using spectrophotometry. proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, migration CRC cells detected cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, transwell assay, scratch test. Three groups nude mice injected 0.2 mL single-cell suspension blank, vector, PKM2-shRNA groups, respectively. PKM2 protein content CRC tissues higher adjacent normal tissues. Results showed PKM2-shRNA group exhibited significantly lower mRNA protein expressions PKM2, decreased PKM2 activity, reduced lactate metabolism level, increased cell apoptosis rate, elevated caspase-3 caspase-9 activity, weakened proliferation, reduction cell invasion migration ability compared vector blank groups. optical density (OD) value lower PKM2-shRNA group blank vector groups. findings indicate shRNA-mediated silencing PKM2 gene promotes apoptosis inhibits aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, migration, invasion CRC cells.
