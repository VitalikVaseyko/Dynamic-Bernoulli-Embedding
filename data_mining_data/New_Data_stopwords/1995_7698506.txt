 previously found long-term exposure fatty acids impairs glucose-induced insulin release. present study, investigated whether impairment related decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) increased PDH kinase activity. Rat pancreatic islets cultured 48 h RPMI-1640 medium without 0.125 mmol/l palmitate. Potentiation insulin responses succinic acid monomethylester (SAM) 10 mmol/l acetate pyruvate subsequently compared order assess whether generation acetyl-coenzyme (CoA) pyruvate deficient intact beta-cell. Potentiation acetate similar control palmitate-preexposed islets. contrast, pyruvate potentiated SAM-induced response 122% control 39% palmitate-exposed islets (P < 0.001). extracts palmitate-exposed islets, active (unphosphorylated) form PDH decreased 50% total PDH activity (assessed phosphatase treatment) 25%. proportion active form total PDH activity also reduced (42.7 +/- 2.6% palmitate vs. 66.6 +/- 4.3% control islets, P < 0.01). preparations, PDH kinase activity enhanced 1.7-fold palmitate terms rate constant ATP-dependent inactivation PDH (P < 0.05). test role free (not PDH-bound) kinase, PDH-free mitochondrial fraction prepared, kinase activity tested pig heart PDH preparation. Free kinase activity increased 1.9-fold palmitate-treated islets (P < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
