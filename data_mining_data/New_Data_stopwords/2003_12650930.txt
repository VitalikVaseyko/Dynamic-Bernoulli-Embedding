 HERC proteins characterized one RCC1-like domains well C-terminal HECT domain amino acid sequences. led researchers suggest may act guanine nucleotide exchange factors E3 ubiquitin ligases. describe physical interaction HECT domain HERC1, giant protein involved intracellular membrane traffic, M2 isoform glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). Partial colocalization endogenous proteins observed immunofluorescence studies. interaction neither induced M2-PK ubiquitination affected enzymatic activity. putative significance association discussed.
