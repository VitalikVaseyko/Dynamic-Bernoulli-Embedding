 Aerobic glycolysis, also referred Warburg effect, regarded dominant metabolic phenotype cancer cells long time. recently, shown mitochondria tumors defective ability carry oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Instead, highly aggressive cancer cells, mitochondrial energy pathways reprogrammed meet challenges high energy demand, better utilization available fuels macromolecular synthesis rapid cell division migration. Mitochondrial energy reprogramming also involved regulation oncogenic pathways via mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling post-translational modification oncoproteins. addition, neoplastic mitochondria engage crosstalk tumor microenvironment. example, signals cancer-associated fibroblasts drive tumor mitochondria utilize OXPHOS, process known reverse Warburg effect. Emerging evidence shows cancer cells acquire hybrid glycolysis/OXPHOS phenotype glycolysis OXPHOS utilized energy production biomass synthesis. hybrid glycolysis/OXPHOS phenotype facilitates metabolic plasticity cancer cells may specifically associated metastasis therapy-resistance. Moreover, cancer cells switch metabolism phenotypes response external stimuli better survival. Taking account metabolic heterogeneity plasticity cancer cells, therapies targeting cancer metabolic dependency principle made effective.
