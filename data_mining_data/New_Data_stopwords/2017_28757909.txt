 Cellular reprogramming accompanied metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) toward glycolysis. Previous results laboratory showed hypoxia alone able reprogram primordial germ cells (PGCs) pluripotency action mediated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). HIF1 exerts myriad actions upregulating several hundred genes, ascertain whether metabolic switch toward glycolysis solely responsible reprogramming, PGCs cultured presence pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) activator, glycolysis promoted manipulating PPARgamma. Conversely, OXPHOS stimulated inhibiting PDK1 activity normoxic hypoxic conditions. Inhibition promotion autophagy reactive oxygen species (ROS) production performed ascertain role cell reprogramming. results show metabolic shift toward glycolysis, autophagy, mitochondrial inactivation early rise ROS levels necessary PGC reprogramming. processes governed HIF1/HIF2 balance strict intermediate Oct4 levels. Histone acetylation plays role reprogramming observed reprogramming conditions. pluripotent cells thus generated unable self-renew, probably due insufficient Blimp1 downregulation lack Klf4 cMyc expression.
