 Mangiferin, xanthone glucoside, associated traditional herbs demonstrated improve abnormalities lipid metabolism. However, underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. study investigated anti-steatotic effect mangiferin fructose-fed spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)s mutation sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1. results showed co-administration mangiferin (15 mg/kg, daily, oral gavage) 7 weeks dramatically diminished fructose-induced increases hepatic triglyceride content Oil Red O-stained area SHRs. However, blood pressure, fructose chow intakes, white adipose tissue weight metabolic parameters (plasma concentrations glucose, insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol non-esterified fatty acids) unaffected mangiferin treatment. Mechanistically, mangiferin treatment suppressed acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-2 expression mRNA protein levels liver. contrast, mangiferin treatment without effect hepatic mRNA and/or protein expression SREBP-1/1c, carbohydrate response element binding protein, liver pyruvate kinase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, DGAT-1, monoacyglycerol acyltransferase-2, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 acyl-CoA oxidase. Collectively, results suggest mangiferin treatment ameliorates fatty liver fructose-fed SHRs inhibiting hepatic DGAT-2 catalyzes final step triglyceride biosynthesis. anti-steatotic effect mangiferin may occur independently hepatic signals associated de novo fatty acid synthesis oxidation.
