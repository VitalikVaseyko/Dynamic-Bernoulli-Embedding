 cancer cells undergo characteristic metabolic changes commonly referred Warburg effect, one hallmarks dramatic increase rate lactic acid fermentation. leads production protons, turn acidifies microenvironment surrounding tumors. Cancer cells acquired resistance acid toxicity, allowing survive grow detrimental conditions. Kidney type glutaminase (GLS1), responsible conversion glutamine glutamate, produces ammonia part catalytic activities shown modulate cellular acidity. study, show tissue, type 2, transglutaminase (TG2), gamma-glutamyl transferase highly expressed metastatic cancers produces ammonia byproduct catalytic activity, up-regulated decreases cellular pH helps protect cells acid-induced cell death. Since TG2 GLS1 similarly function protect cancer cells, proceeded demonstrate treatment variety cancer cell types inhibitors proteins results synthetic lethality. combination doses inhibitors induce cell death, individual treatment compound shows little ability kill cells. results suggest combination drug treatments simultaneously target TG2 GLS1 might provide effective strategy killing cancer cells.
