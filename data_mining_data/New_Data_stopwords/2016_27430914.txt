 cancer cells predominantly produce ATP maintaining high rate lactate fermentation, rather maintaining comparatively low rate tricarboxylic acid cycle, i.e., Warburg's effect. pathway, pyruvate produced glycolysis converted lactic acid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Here, demonstrated water extracts seeds Myristica fragrans Houtt. (MF) inhibit vitro enzymatic activity LDH. MF effectively suppressed cell growth overall Warburg effect HT29 human colon cancer cells. Although expression LDH-A changed MF, lactate production LDH activity decreased MF-treated cells normoxic hypoxic conditions. addition, intracellular ATP levels also decreased MF treatment, uptake glucose also reduced MF treatment. Furthermore, experiment tumor growth vivo mice model revealed MF effectively reduced growth allotransplanted Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Taken together, results suggest MF effectively inhibits cancer growth metabolism inhibiting activity LDH, major enzyme responsible regulating cancer metabolism. results implicate MF potential candidate development novel drug cancer inhibition LDH activity.
