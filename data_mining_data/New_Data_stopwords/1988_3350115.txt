 Mouse transplanted tumors, contrast normal tissues, contain pyruvate kinase (PK) variant sensitive inhibitory action L-cysteine less sensitive saturated fatty acids normal enzyme. selected normal tumor materials two fractions PK separated. Fraction (20-30% (NH4)2SO4 saturation) dominated normal liver, fraction B (50-60% (NH4)2SO4 saturation) skeletal muscles Ehrlich ascites tumor. fraction B tumor material sensitive L-cysteine, seems contain tumor-specific PK variant might considered marker neoplastic transformation broad spectrum mouse experimental tumors.
