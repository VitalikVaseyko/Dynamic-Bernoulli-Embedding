 Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) key signaling molecule downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway master regulator multiple kinases cells epithelial hematopoietic lineages. physiological role PDK1 regulating skin immune homeostasis known. developed mouse model PDK1 conditionally ablated activated CD4 cells, regulatory cells, mature keratinocytes OX40-Cre recombinase expression. resultant mice (PDK1-CKO) spontaneously developed severe dermatitis, skin fibrosis, systemic helper type 2 immunity, succumbing 11 weeks age. series T-cell transfers, bone marrow reconstitutions, crossing lymphocyte-deficient backgrounds, demonstrate ablation PDK1 keratinocytes major driver disease pathogenesis. PDK1-deficient keratinocytes exhibit intrinsic defects expression key structural proteins including cytokeratin-10 loricrin, resulting increased keratinocyte turnover, turn triggers inflammation, T-cell recruitment, immune-mediated destruction. results reveal PDK1 central regulator keratinocyte homeostasis prevents skin immune infiltration inflammation.
