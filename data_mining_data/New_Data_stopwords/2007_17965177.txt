 Catabolism storage reserves biosynthesis metabolites necessary growth essential seed germination establishment. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant (pkp1) deficient plastidic pyruvate kinase (PK(p)) unable accumulate storage oil extent wild type shows delayed germination seedling establishment dependent exogenous sugar supply. appears, however, though phenotypes entirely caused specifically lack seed oil may related reduced PK(p) activity germinating seeds. Increasing sucrose concentration medium inhibits germination pkp1, possibly due accumulation soluble sugars seeds. Germinating seeds pkp1 unable metabolize storage oil cannot utilize applied sucrose hypocotyl elongation dark. Moreover, pkp1 contains less tocopherol chlorophyll wild type. Taken together, results consistent model PK(p) required efficient conversion sugar precursors different anabolic pathways.
