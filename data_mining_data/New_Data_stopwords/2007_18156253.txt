 Members novel glycerate-2-kinase (GK-II) family tentatively identified broad range species, including eukaryotes archaea many bacteria lack canonical enzyme GarK (GK-I) family. recently reported three-dimensional structure GK-II Thermotoga maritima (TM1585; PDB code 2b8n) revealed new fold distinct known kinase families. Here, verified enzymatic activity TM1585, assessed kinetic characteristics, used directed mutagenesis confirm essential role two active-site residues Lys-47 Arg-325. main objective study apply comparative genomics reconstruction metabolic pathways associated GK-II bacteria and, particular, T. maritima. Comparative analyses approximately 400 bacterial genomes revealed remarkable variety pathways lead GK-II-driven utilization glycerate via glycolysis/gluconeogenesis route. case T. maritima, three-step serine degradation pathway inferred based tentative identification two additional enzymes, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase hydroxypyruvate reductase (TM1400 TM1401, respectively), convert serine glycerate via hydroxypyruvate. enzymatic activities experimentally verified, entire pathway validated vitro reconstitution.
