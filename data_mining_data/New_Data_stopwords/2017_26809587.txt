 Epithelial morphogenesis stability essential normal development organ homeostasis. mouse neural plate cuboidal epithelium remodels columnar pseudostratified epithelium course 24 hr. show transition columnar epithelium fails mutant embryos lack tumor suppressor PTEN, although proliferation, patterning apical-basal polarity markers normal mutants. Pten phenotype mimicked constitutive activation PI3 kinase rescued removal PDK1 (PDPK1), depend downstream kinases AKT mTORC1. High resolution imaging shows PTEN required stabilization planar cell packing neural plate formation stable apical-basal microtubule arrays. data suggest appropriate levels membrane-associated PDPK1 required stabilization apical junctions, promotes cell elongation, epithelial morphogenesis.
