 Cancer cell metabolism characterized enhanced uptake utilization glucose, phenomenon known Warburg effect. persistent activation aerobic glycolysis cancer cells linked activation oncogenes loss tumor suppressors, thereby fundamentally advancing cancer progression. respect, inhibition glycolytic capacity may contribute anticancer effect malignant cells. Understanding mechanisms aerobic glycolysis may present new basis cancer treatment. Accordingly, interrupting lactate fermentation and/or cancer-promoting metabolic sites may provide promising strategy halt tumor development. review, discuss dysregulated reprogrammed cancer metabolism followed clinical relevance metabolic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase glutaminase. proper intervention metabolic sites may provide therapeutic advantage help overcome resistance chemotherapy radiotherapy.
