 Huntington disease (HD) hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized motor, psychiatric, cognitive symptoms. genetic defect responsible onset disease, expansion CAG repeats exon 1 gene codes huntingtin chromosome 4, unambiguously identified. hand, mechanisms mutation causes disease completely understood yet. However, defects energy metabolism affected cells may cause oxidative damage, proposed one underlying molecular mechanisms participate etiology disease. effort investigate extent oxidative damage occurring protein level, used parallel proteomic approach identify proteins potentially involved processes upstream downstream disease-causing huntingtin well established HD mouse model (R6/2 transgenic mice). demonstrated expression levels dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase aspartate aminotransferase increase consistently course disease (10-week-old mice). contrast, pyruvate dehydrogenase expression levels found decreased 10-week-old HD transgenic mice compared young (4-week-old) mice. experimental approach also led identification oxidatively modified proteins. Six proteins found significantly oxidized old R6/2 transgenic mice compared either young transgenic mice non-transgenic mice. proteins alpha-enolase, gamma-enolase (neuron-specific enolase), aconitase, voltage-dependent anion channel 1, heat shock protein 90, creatine kinase. oxidative damage proved play important role pathogenesis progression Huntington disease, results first time identify specific oxidatively modified proteins potentially contribute pathogenesis Huntington disease.
