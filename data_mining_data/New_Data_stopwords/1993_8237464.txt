 sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), number metabolic alterations brain observed soon onset initial clinical symptoms. particular, impairments glucose utilization related metabolic pathways prominent well-established findings incipient AD, resembling metabolic abnormalities found noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. mimic abnormalities, administered intracerebroventricular (icv) injection streptozotocin (STZ) rats studied effects glucose glycogen metabolism cerebral cortex hippocampus compared controls. enzymatic activities studied dropped significantly 10-30% brain cortex (cort.) hippocampus (hc) 3 6 weeks icv STZ injection: hexokinase (15% 3 weeks cort.; 14% 6 weeks cort.; 12% 3 weeks hc; 28% 6 weeks hc), phosphofructokinase (15%; 15%; 24%; 15%), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (10%; 12%; 30%; 19%), pyruvate kinase (22%; 13%; 22%; 28%), glucose-6-phosphatase (10%; 23%; 14%; 19%) phosphorylase (22%; 11%; 30%; 15%). content glycogen significantly higher STZ-treated rats control animals (7% 3 weeks 15% 6 weeks cortex). contrast reduced enzymatic activities, observed changes concentrations glycolytic intermediates glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, pyruvate, lactate glucose-1-phosphate. data clearly indicate reduced glycolytic enzyme activity icv administration STZ suggest gluconeogenesis consequent abnormalities glucose breakdown. model may thus assumed useful tool investigate pathogenetic factors involved sporadic dementia Alzheimer type.
