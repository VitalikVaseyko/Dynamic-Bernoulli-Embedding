 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) catalyses transamination reaction links carbohydrate amino acid metabolism. study, examined effect silencing cytosolic ALT (cALT) expression hepatic metabolism Sparus aurata. number siRNA shRNA designed down-regulate cALT expression validated HEK-293 cells transfected plasmids expressing S. aurata cALT mitochondrial ALT (mALT) isoforms: ALT silencing significantly decreased expression levels S. aurata mRNA cALT1 62% (siRNA) 48% (shRNA) values observed control cells. effect cALT silencing analysed liver S. aurata 72 h intraperitoneal injection chitosan-tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanoparticles complexed plasmid encoding shRNA down-regulate cALT expression (pCpG-si1sh1). fish fed diets different ratio protein carbohydrate treated chitosan-TPP-pCpG-si1sh1, cALT1 cALT2 mRNA levels significantly decreased irrespective diet. Consistently, ALT activity decreased liver treated animals. liver S. aurata treated chitosan-TPP-pCpG-si1sh1 nanoparticles, down-regulation cALT expression increased activity key enzymes glycolysis (6-phosphofructo-1-kinase pyruvate kinase) protein metabolism (glutamate dehydrogenase). Besides showing first time administration chitosan-TPP-pCpG-si1sh1 nanoparticles silences hepatic cALT expression vivo, data support down-regulation cALT could improve use dietary carbohydrates obtain energy spare protein catabolism.
