 Mitochondrial uptake beta-oxidation long-chain fatty acids markedly impaired aging rat heart. alterations would expected adversely affect overall pyridine nucleotides, NADH levels change significantly age. conundrum suggests specific compensatory mechanisms occur aging heart. comparison cardiac pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) kinetics 4- 24- 28-month-old F344 rats revealed 60% significant increase V(max) change PDC expression, 1.6-fold decrease Michaelis constant (K(m)) old compared young rats. observed kinetic adjustments selective PDC, neither V(max) K(m) citrate synthase changed age. PDC kinase-4 mRNA levels decreased 57% old vs young rat hearts correlated 45% decrease PDC phosphorylation. conclude PDC old rat hearts catabolizes pyruvate efficiently due adaptive change phosphorylation.
