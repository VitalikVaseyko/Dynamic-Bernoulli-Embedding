 1. time-course changes content intermediates glycolysis rat liver kidney cortex severance blood supply investigated. 2. decline content ATP rapid kidney (1.7-0.5mumol/g 30s) liver (2.7-1.6mumol/g 60s). tissues AMP P(i) accumulated. 3. Net formation lactate 1.7mumol/g second minute ischaemia liver well-fed rats, 1.1mumol/g liver 48h-starved rats, 1.0mumol/g first 30s ischaemia kidney. Net formation alpha-glycerophosphate rapid, especially liver. 4. kidney concentration beta-hydroxybutyrate rose, alpha-oxoglutarate acetoacetate decreased. 5. organs concentrations fructose diphosphate triose phosphates increased ischaemia phosphorylated C(3) intermediates decreased. 6. concentration hexose 6-phosphates rose rapidly first minute ischaemia liver, decreased renal ischaemia. 7. kidney content glutamine fell 2min ischaemia, ammonia glutamate rose. 8. redox states cytoplasmic mitochondrial NAD couple kidney cortex similar liver. 9. regulatory role glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase discussed relation observed changes concentrations glycolytic intermediates.
