 BACKGROUND: Among prominent metabolic alterations cancer cells increase glucose consumption conversion glucose lactic acid via reduction pyruvate even presence oxygen. phenomenon, known aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, may provide rationale therapeutic strategies inhibit tumour growth administration ketogenic diet average protein low carbohydrates high fat enriched omega-3 fatty acids medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). METHODS: Twenty-four female NMRI nude mice injected subcutaneously tumour cells gastric adenocarcinoma cell line 23132/87. animals randomly split two feeding groups fed either ketogenic diet (KD group; n = 12) standard diet (SD group; n = 12) ad libitum. Experiments ended upon attainment target tumor volume 600 mm3 700 mm3. two diets compared based tumour growth survival time (interval tumour cell injection attainment target tumour volume). RESULTS: ketogenic diet well accepted KD mice. tumour growth KD group significantly delayed compared SD group. Tumours KD group reached target tumour volume 34.2 +/- 8.5 days versus 23.3 +/- 3.9 days SD group. day 20, tumours KD group grew faster although differences mean tumour growth continued significantly. Importantly, revealed significantly larger necrotic areas tumours SD group areas vital tumour cells appear fewer vessels tumours SD group. Viable tumour cells border zone surrounding necrotic areas tumours groups exhibited glycolytic phenotype expression glucose transporter-1 transketolase-like 1 enzyme. CONCLUSION: Application unrestricted ketogenic diet enriched omega-3 fatty acids MCT delayed tumour growth mouse xenograft model. studies needed address impact diet tumour-relevant functions invasive growth metastasis.
