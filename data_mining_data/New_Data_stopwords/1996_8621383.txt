 Glucose catabolism induces expression L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene glucose response element (GIRE). metabolic pathway used glucose phosphorylation glucose 6-phosphate glucokinase induce L-PK gene expression hepatocytes remains unknown. sugar alcohol xylitol metabolized xylulose 5-phosphate, intermediate nonoxidative branch pentose phosphate pathway. study, demonstrated xylitol low concentration (O.5 mM) induced expression L-PK/CAT construct glucose-responsive mhAT3F hepatoma cells level 20 mM glucose, affect intracellular concentration glucose 6-phosphate significantly. effect xylitol induction L-PK gene expression noncumulative glucose since 20 mM glucose plus 5 mM xylitol induced expression L-PK/CAT construct similarly 20 mM glucose alone. hepatocytes primary culture, 5 mM xylitol induced accumulation L-PK mRNA even absence insulin. Furthermore, response xylitol well glucose required presence functional GIRE. assumed results glucose induces expression L-PK gene nonoxidative branch pentose phosphate pathway. effect xylitol low concentration suggests glucose signal transcriptional machinery mediated xylulose 5-phosphate.
