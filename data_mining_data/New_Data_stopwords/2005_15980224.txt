 PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest corneal haze injury involves changes light-scattering properties keratocytes possibly linked abundant expression water-soluble proteins. purpose study determine protein expression pattern keratocytes different species different cultured rabbit keratocyte phenotypes assess differences light-scattering vitro. METHODS: Water-soluble proteins isolated corneal epithelial cells keratocytes several species, including human (Hu), mouse (Mo), rabbit (Ra), chicken (Ch), pig (P) different cultured rabbit keratocyte phenotypes. Proteins characterized SDS-PAGE, tryptic peptide sequence analysis, Western blot analysis. Light-scattering actin organization cultured cells determined confocal reflectance fluorescence microscopy, respectively. RESULTS: Protein expression patterns varied substantially species cell types, five new abundantly expressed proteins identified including, LDH (Ra, Ch), G3PDH (Hu, Ch), pyruvate kinase (Ch), Annexin II (Ch), protein disulfide isomerase (Ch). Different rabbit keratocyte phenotypes also showed different levels expression ALDH1A1 TKT, myofibroblasts showing greatest reduction. Myofibroblasts showed significantly greater (P < 0.05) light-scattering also showed greatest organization actin filaments. CONCLUSIONS: Abundant protein expression characteristic feature corneal keratocytes lost cells phenotypically modulated culture. Greater light-scattering myofibroblasts also provides support link cellular transparency haze injury possibly related loss protein expression development prominent actin filament bundles.
