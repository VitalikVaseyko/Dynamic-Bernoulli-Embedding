 mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate, linking glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Knowledge mechanisms regulate PDC activity important, PDC inactivation crucial glucose conservation glucose scarce, whereas adequate PDC activity required allow ATP FA production glucose. mechanisms control mammalian PDC activity include phosphorylation (inactivation) family pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs 1-4) dephosphorylation (activation, reactivation) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatases (PDPs 1 2). Isoform-specific differences kinetic parameters, regulation, phosphorylation site specificity PDKs introduce variations regulation PDC activity differing endocrine metabolic states. review, summarize recent significant advances knowledge mechanisms regulating PDC emphasis PDKs, particular PDK4, whose expression linked sustained changes tissue lipid handling may represent attractive target pharmacological interventions aimed modulating whole body glucose, lipid, lactate homeostasis disease states.
