 Incubation triazine dye Procion Blue MX-R L- M-type pyruvate kinase resulted rapid time- dye-concentration-dependent loss activity. L-type pyruvate kinase protected low concentration Mg2+; case M-type enzyme. Modification L-type form resulted incorporation 1.54 +/- 0.057 mol dye/mol enzyme subunit absence Mg2+, 0.73 +/- 0.024 mol dye/mol enzyme subunit presence Mg2+. Tryptic peptide mapping L-type pyruvate kinase modified presence absence Mg2+ indicated two sites modified enzyme, one protected Mg2+. pKa nucleophile involved modification calculated 7.1, implicating possible involvement histidine residue. L-type enzyme bound Sepharose-immobilized Procion Blue MX-R specifically presence Mg2+, whereas binding M-type enzyme Mg2+-independent. specific interaction L-type pyruvate kinase dye exploited large-scale purification enzyme isolation phosphorylated enzyme.
