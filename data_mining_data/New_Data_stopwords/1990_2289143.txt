 possibility glucocorticoid-dependence obesity obese fa/fa rat reflects overactivity glucocorticoids brain investigated studies enzyme activities glucocorticoid type II (GR) receptors. activity 2 glucocorticoid-sensitive enzymes, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutamine synthetase, increased hippocampus obese rats. contrast malate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, glucocorticoid-insensitive enzymes, normal. Adrenalectomy obese rats reduced glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity level lean rats. Scatchard analysis [3H]corticosterone binding showed number type II (GR) receptors increased hypothalamus hippocampus obese rats affinity receptors reduced. evidence supports hypothesis excessive central glucocorticoid activity obese rat.
