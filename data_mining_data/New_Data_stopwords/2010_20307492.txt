 Ethyl pyruvate (EP), simple derivative endogenous pyruvate, anti-inflammatory function. Recently, protective neurological effects EP reported cell culture animal models neurological diseases. present study investigates protective effects EP dopaminergic cell death Parkinson's disease models. selective death dopaminergic neurons substantia nigra prevented EP 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse models. EP also suppressed 1-methyl-4-pyridinium-induced cell death SH-SY5Y cells restored phosphorylation extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Thus, EP neuroprotective effects EP Parkinson's disease related signaling pathways.
