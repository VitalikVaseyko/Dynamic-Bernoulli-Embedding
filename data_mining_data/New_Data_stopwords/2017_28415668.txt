 recent decades, miRNA reported crucial modulator biology progressions. work aims assess expression role miR-let-7a pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) CC tissues cell lines. Here, identified miR-let-7a expression decreased CC tissues, SiHa HeLa cells (all P < 0.001), however, PKM2 expression increased samples. Statistically, miR-let-7a inversely associated PKM2 mRNA protein (p = 0.013, p = 0.015, respectively). In-vitro assays revealed ectopic miR-let-7a expression repressed SiHa HeLa cell proliferation, migration invasion, enhanced SiHa HeLa cell apoptosis. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays revealed 3'-UTR PKM2 identified target miR-let-7a, miR-let-7a affected expression PKM2 SiHa HeLa cells. Besides, PKM2 plasmids partially abrogated inhibitory effects miR-let-7a, si-PKM2 enhanced inhibitory effects miR-let-7a. vivo, miR-let-7a mimics indeed repressed tumor growth mice xenograft model. conclusion, results demonstrated miR-let-7a inhibits cell proliferation, migration invasion down-regulation PKM2 cervical cancer. miR-let-7a/PKM2 pathway may useful therapeutic target CC patients.
