 BACKGROUND: important feature eukaryotic evolution metabolic compartmentalization, certain pathways restricted cytosol specific organelles. Glycolysis eukaryotes described cytosolic process. universality canon challenged recent genome data suggest glycolytic enzymes made stramenopiles bear mitochondrial targeting peptides. RESULTS: Mining oomycete, diatom, brown algal genomes indicates stramenopiles encode two forms enzymes second half glycolysis, one without mitochondrial targeting peptides. predicted mitochondrial targeting confirmed using fluorescent tags localize phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase Phytophthora infestans, oomycete causes potato blight. genome-wide search enzymes atypical mitochondrial locations identified phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, phosphoserine aminotransferase, phosphoserine phosphatase, form pathway generating serine glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate. Fluorescent tags confirmed delivery serine biosynthetic enzymes P. infestans mitochondria. cytosolic form serine biosynthetic pathway, occurs eukaryotes, missing oomycetes stramenopiles. glycolysis serine metabolism pathways oomycetes appear mosaics enzymes different ancestries. noncanonical oomycete mitochondrial enzymes closest affinity phylogenetic analyses proteins stramenopiles, others cluster bacterial, plant, animal proteins. genes encoding mitochondrial phosphoglycerate kinase serine-forming enzymes physically linked oomycete chromosomes, suggests shared origin. CONCLUSIONS: Stramenopile metabolism appears shaped acquisition genes descent lateral endosymbiotic gene transfer, along targeting proteins locations novel compared eukaryotes. Colocalization glycolytic serine biosynthesis enzymes mitochondria apparently necessary since share common intermediate. results indicate descriptions metabolism textbooks cover full diversity eukaryotic biology.
