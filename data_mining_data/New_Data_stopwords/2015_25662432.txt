 aim study investigate behavioral assessment activities important enzymes involved phosphoryl transfer network rat brains experimentally infected Trypanosoma evansi. Behavioral assessment (cognitive performance), pro-inflammatory cytokines serum activities adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine kinase (CK) brain evaluated 5 15 days post-infection (PI). demonstrate cognitive impairment rats infected T. evansi. 5 15 days PI, memory deficit depressant activity demonstrated inhibition avoidance test increase immobility time tail suspension test, respectively. day 5 PI, decrease CK activity increase AK activity observed. day 15 PI, increase CK activity decrease AK activity observed. Considering importance energy metabolism brain functioning, possible changes activity enzymes involved cerebral phosphotransfer network increase proinflammatory cytokines (TNF IFN) may involved least part cognitive impairment infected rats T. evansi.
