 Dysfunction cardiac cells hypoxia identified essential event leading myocytes functional failure. MiRNAs importantly regulatory small-noncoding RNAs negatively regulate gene expression direct binding 3'-UTR region target mRNAs. Recent studies demonstrated miRNAs aberrantly expressed cardiovascular system pathological conditions.Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) kinase phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivate it, leading elevated anaerobic glycolysis decreased cellular respiration. present study, report miR-138 expressions significantly suppressed long exposure hypoxia. addition, overexpression miR-138 protects human cardiac cells hypoxia. observed miR-138 inhibits glycolysis promotes mitochondrial respiration directly targetting PDK1. Moreover, demonstrate hypoxia induces cardiac cell death increased glycolysis decreased mitochondrial respiration. Inhibition glycolysis either glycolysis inhibitor knockdown glycolysis enzymes, Glucose transportor 1 (Glut1) PDK1 contributes cardiac cells' survival. cell sentivity hypoxia recovered PDK1 level restored miR-138 overexpressing cardiac cells. present study leads intervention novel therapeutic strategies cardiac cells dysfunction surgery ischemia.
