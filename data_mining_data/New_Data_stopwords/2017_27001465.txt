 Understanding mechanisms link aberrant metabolic adaptation pro-survival responses glioma cells crucial towards development new anti-glioma therapies. previously reported CK2 associated glioma cell survival, evaluated involvement regulation glucose metabolism. Inhibition CK2 increased expression metabolic regulators, PDK4 AMPK along key cellular energy sensor CREB. increase concomitant altered metabolic profile characterized decreased glucose uptake PDK4 AMPK dependent manner. Increased PDK4 expression CREB dependent, exogenous inhibition CREB functions abrogated CK2 inhibitor mediated increase PDK4 expression. Interestingly, PDK4 regulated AMPK phosphorylation turn affected cell viability CK2 inhibitor treated glioma cells. CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-Tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) significantly retarded growth glioma xenografts athymic nude mouse model. Coherent vitro findings, elevated senescence, pAMPK PDK4 levels also observed TBB-treated xenograft tissue. Taken together, CK2 inhibition glioma cells drives PDK4-AMPK axis affect metabolic profile strong bearing survival.
