 total sequence 13,021 base-pair (bp) genomic fragment containing rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene determined "shot gun" sequencing. fragment includes 8360 bp L-PK gene, plus 3193 bp 5'-flanking 1468 bp 3'-flanking regions. Like chicken PK-M1 gene, rat L-PK gene exhibits fully conserved exon-intron structure, 11 exons 10 introns. chicken M1 gene, coding sequences well conserved (about 70%), particular level exons implicated formation PK active sites, exons also partially homologous corresponding sequences yeast gene. Various types repetitive sequences exist L-PK gene, especially two ID (identifier) sequences located second intron 11th exon. Elements similar "cyclic AMP-dependent regulatory element" recently described phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase somatostatin genes found sequenced fragment, far upstream (-2338) downstream (+5788) cap site. Various sequences homologous described regulatory elements (glucocorticoid regulatory elements, enhancers, potential Z-DNA) also observed 5' 3' cap site. comparison 5'-flanking region L-PK gene regions liver-specific non-specific, cyclic-AMP-responsive non-responsive genes also made. revealed various potentially interesting features used guide functional study. cap site determined primer extension nuclease S1 mapping using either mature mRNA precursor RNA templates. templates start site transcription appeared microheterogeneous, 19 14 bp ATG translation initiation codon.
