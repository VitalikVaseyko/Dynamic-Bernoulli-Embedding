 Critical Assessment Genome Interpretation (CAGI) global community experiment objectively assess computational methods predicting phenotypic impacts genomic variation. One 2015-2016 competitions focused predicting influence mutations allosteric regulation human liver pyruvate kinase. 30 different researchers accessed challenge data. However, four groups accepted challenge. Features used predictions ranged evolutionary constraints, mutant site locations relative active effector binding sites, computational docking outputs. Despite range expertise strategies used predictors, best predictions marginally greater random modified allostery resulting mutations. contrast, several groups successfully predicted mutations severely reduced enzymatic activity. Nonetheless, poor predictions allostery stands stark contrast impression left 700 PubMed entries identified using identifiers "computational + allosteric." contrast highlights specialized need new computational tools utilization benchmarks focus allosteric regulation.
