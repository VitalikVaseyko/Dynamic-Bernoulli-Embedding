 Type II Diabetes affects 400 million people worldwide (IDF, 2013). pathology paradoxical: internal starvation activated overfeeding. Hyperinsulinemic impairments glucose homeostasis treated anti-hyperglycemics exacerbating cell starvation, inducing hypoglycemia raising respiratory quotient. Reductions hyperglycemia achieved expense glucose dependency metabolic inflexibility (Gibas & Gibas, 2017). brain immune cycles starvation. bioenergetic model characterizes propagation late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer's disease loss molecular fidelity compromised energy originating brain networks highest metabolic demand. Impaired networks function hubs connectivity "at risk" regions causing propagation disease neighboring cells compensatory up-regulation protein synthesis, including amyloid precursor protein (Demetrius et al., 2014). Impaired brain circuits hypo-metabolic. Cerebral energy declines stages quasi-stable, hyper-metabolism. Elevated insulin low bioavailable glucose cross BBB hyper-activating neurons preserve brain function, thereby overloading astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle. Sustained deficits reprogram neural phenotype toward lactate driven, OXPHOS. Increased OXPHOS fosters competition normal "metabolically charged" neurons limited fuel. Cerebral starvation causes apoptosis healthy neurons due selective disadvantage. neuroenergetic model defines late-onset neural decline symptomatic "brain starvation" resulting physiological paradox, concurrent hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia, without evolved cellular response. Catabolic degeneration occurs spectrum linear energy deficit ranging mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Alzheimer's disease (AD); pathology cerebral starvation known Type III diabetes.
