 studies illuminate particular site altered pyruvate utilization liver mitochondria isolated arsenic-fed rats. Initially, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) levels measured vitro activation. liver homogenates prepared male rats given access deionized drinking water solutions containing 0, 20, 40, 85 ppm arsenic sodium arsenate (As+5) 3 6 weeks. 3 weeks, effects arsenic highest dose level pronounced basal activity (before activation), inhibition 48% control values. total PDH (after activation) inhibited 14, 15, 28% control values 20, 40, 85 ppm As+5, respectively. similar pattern inhibition PDH observed 6 weeks, although inhibition lower highest dose. effect probably reflection mitochondrial regeneration time dose. inhibition PDH activation suggests direct arsenic effect pyruvate utilization involve lipoic acid moiety. Evidence also presented indicates arsenic effect regulating kinase and/or phosphatase. metabolic effects impaired mitochondrial utilization pyruvate also discussed.
