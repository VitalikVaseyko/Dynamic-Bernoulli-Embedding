 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), mammalian mitochondrial serine kinase emerged interesting candidate diabetes therapy. Due high prevalence disease especially type 2 diabetes (T2D) health complications associated it, extensive effort find appropriate treatment. Understanding regulation PDK4 activity would therefore contribute significantly development therapeutic agents. research outlines utilization bioinformatics tools Interweaver, ClustalW Protein Structure Visualizer, order predict proteins potentially interact PDK4 possibly regulate activity. Interweaver database identified 96 proteins possible interaction sites PDK4. Protein p100/p49, containing death domain known role suppressing apoptosis, identified potential partner PDK4. alignment p100/p49 primary sequence PDK4 using ClustalW demonstrated sequence similarity two proteins. Swiss PDB Viewer located positions amino acids hypothetical protein binding motif p100/p49 within 3D structure hPDK4. amino acids found located region PDK4 known bind protein substrates PDK4 may accessible proteins well. findings interesting PDK4 previously associated apoptosis could link apoptosis insulin resistance. Cell biology studies performed verify relationship PDK4 apoptosis. regard, HeLa HepG2 cells treated apoptosis-inducing agents TNFalpha, C2-ceramide, linoleic acid. cells monitored apoptosis PDK4 mRNA expression using DNA laddering assay well Real Time PCR. results showed factors induced apoptosis concentration dependent manner suppressed PDK4 mRNA levels. findings suggested relationship PDK4 apoptosis.
