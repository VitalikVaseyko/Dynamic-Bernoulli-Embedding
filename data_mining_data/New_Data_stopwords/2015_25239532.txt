 Fasting-induced hypothalamic metabolic reprogramming involved regulating energy homeostasis appetite mammals, phenomenon remains unclear poultry. study, expression patterns panel genes related neuropeptides, glucose, lipid metabolism enzymes hypothalamus chickens fasting refeeding characterized microarray analysis quantitative PCR. Results showed 48 h fasting upregulated (P < 0.05) mRNA expressions orexigenic neuropeptide agouti-related protein downregulated (P < 0.05) anorexigenic neuropeptide pro-opiomelanocortin; growth hormone-releasing hormone; islet amyloid polypeptide; thyroid-stimulating hormone, beta; glycoprotein hormones, alpha polypeptide. 48 h fasting, mRNA expression fatty acid beta-oxidation [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A, forkhead box O1], energy sensor protein [sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) forkhead box O1], glycolysis inhibitor (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) enhanced, fatty acid synthesis transport associated genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase, apolipoprotein A-I, endothelial lipase, fatty acid binding protein 7) suppressed. Liver muscle also demonstrated similar expression patterns genes related glucose lipid metabolism hypothalamus, except acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4, apolipoprotein A-I. results intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection experiments confirmed alpha-lipoic acid (ALA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 inhibitor, 0.10 mumol) NADH (SIRT1 inhibitor, 0.80 mumol) significantly suppressed appetite chickens, whereas 2-deoxy-d-glucose (glycolytic inhibitor, 0.12 1.20 mumol) NAD(+) (SIRT1 activator, 0.08 0.80 mumol) increased feed intake chickens. orexigenic effect NAD(+) also blocked cotreatment NADH. However, ICV injection either GW7647 (PPARalpha agonist) GW6471 (PPARalpha antagonist) showed effects feed intake. Results suggested hypothalamic glycolysis (inhibited ALA promoted 2-deoxy-d-glucose) SIRT1 (inhibited NADH promoted NAD(+)), PPARalpha, probably involved feed intake regulation chickens.
