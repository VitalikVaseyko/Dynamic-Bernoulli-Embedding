 BHE/cdb rat mutation adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase impairs insulin secretion. However, male BHE/cdb rats normal circulating glucose enhanced glucose tolerance. aim current study identify mechanisms enhanced glucose tolerance. respiratory exchange ratio increased, indicating increased oxidation carbohydrate BHE/cdb rats, consistent increases liver pyruvate dehydrogenase activity muscle citrate synthase activity. Liver also exhibited diminished phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase content, correlated decreased counter-regulatory response insulin tolerance test. Signaling via Akt AMP-dependent kinase pathways liver could account lower blood glucose. conclude chronically low insulin secretion leads adaption glucose metabolism primarily liver maintain euglycemia.
