 Corynebacterium glutamicum R efficiently produces valuable chemicals glucose oxygen-deprived conditions. effort reduce acetate byproduct, acetate productivity several mutant-disrupted genes encoding possible key enzymes acetate formation determined. Disruption aceE gene encodes E1 enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex resulted almost complete elimination acetate formation oxygen-deprived conditions, implying acetate synthesis conditions essentially via acetyl-coenzyme (CoA). Simultaneous disruption pta, encoding phosphotransacetylase, ack, encoding acetate kinase, resulted measurable change acetate productivity. mutant strain disruptions pta, ack as-yet uncharacterized gene (cgR2472) exhibited 65% reduced acetate productivity compared parental strain, although single disruption cgR2472 exhibited effect acetate productivity. gene cgR2472 shown encode CoA-transferase (CTF) catalyzes formation acetate acetyl-CoA. results indicate PTA-ACK well CTF involved acetate production C. glutamicum. study provided basic information reduce acetate production oxygen-deprived conditions.
