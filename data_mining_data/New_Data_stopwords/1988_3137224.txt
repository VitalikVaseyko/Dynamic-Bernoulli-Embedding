 method involving labeling isotopic steady state modeling tricarboxylic acid cycle used identify respiratory substrates lettuce embryos early steps germination. compared specific radioactivities aspartate glutamate glutamate C-1 C-5 labeling different substrates. Labeling [U-14C]acetate 14CO2 used verify validity model study; relative labeling aspartate glutamate expected normal operation tricarboxylic acid cycle. labeling 14CO2, label distribution glutamate molecule (95% label glutamate C-1) consistent input carbon via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase reaction, relative specific radioactivities aspartate glutamate permitted quantification apparent rate fumarase reaction. CO2 intermediates related tricarboxylic acid cycle labeled [U-14C]acetate, [1-14C] hexanoate, [U-14C]palmitic acid. ratios specific radioactivities asparate glutamate glutamate C-1 C-5 indicated fatty acids degraded acetyl units, suggesting operation beta-oxidation, acety-CoA incorporated directly citrate. Short-term labeling [1-14C]hexanoate showed citrate glutamate labeled earlier malate aspartate, showing fatty acid metabolized tricarboxylic acid cycle rather glyoxylate cycle. agreement flux gluconeogenesis compared efflux respiratory CO2. fraction labeled substrate incorporated carbohydrates 5% converted CO2; carbon flux gluconeogenesis determined labeling 14CO2 [1-14C]hexanoate specific radioactivity aspartate C-1 amount label incorporated carbohydrate fraction. 7.4% efflux respiratory CO2. labeling alanine indicates low activity either malic enzyme sequence phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase/pyruvate kinase. labeling [U-14C]glucose, ratios specific radioactivities indicated labeled carbohydrates contributed less 10% flux acetyl-CoA. model indicated glycolytic flux partitioned one-third pyruvate two-thirds oxalacetate therefore mainly anaplerotic. possible role fatty acids main source acetyl-CoA respiration discussed.
