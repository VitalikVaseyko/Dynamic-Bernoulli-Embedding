 pyruvate kinase activated ribose-5-phosphate Escherichia coli purified homogeneity, taking advantage stabilization enzyme inhibitor phosphate thiol reagents. native enzyme tetrameric quaternary structure which, prone dissociation many conditions, remains intact presence reagents. enzyme found reactivate dilution 8 urea. Interestingly, recovery activity greatly increased phosphate, allosteric inhibitor, markedly reduced allosteric activator, ribose-5-phosphate, implying harder enzyme refold 'relaxed state.' Proteolysis studies indicate open structure presence activator.
