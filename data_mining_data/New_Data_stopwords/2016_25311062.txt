 PURPOSE: investigate mechanisms impairments oxidative metabolism obese diabetic (T2DM) skeletal muscle, study analysed adaptive expression genes involved fatty acid (FA) oxidation mitochondrial biogenesis primary myotubes treated elevated FAs. METHODS: Muscle samples obese obese T2DM donors stored processed human primary skeletal muscle myotubes, treated 6 h saturated (palmitic acid) monounsaturated (oleic acid) FA without polyunsaturated FA (eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA). Real-time PCR analysis used determine mRNA expression. RESULTS: Basal pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA expression whole muscle samples obese T2DM subjects increased compared lean (P < 0.05; n = 13-20/group). obese- T2DM-derived myotubes, oleic acid treatment alone combination EPA increased PDK4 mRNA expression compared control (P < 0.05; n = 7/group), whereas palmitic acid alone combination EPA increased PDK4 mRNA T2DM-derived myotubes compared control (P < 0.05; n = 7/group). EPA alone alter mRNA expression PDK4. CONCLUSIONS: findings show FAs induce expression PDK4 mRNA, increased myotubes cultured obese T2DM donors. persistent difference PDK4 expression, present culturing, suggests fundamental alteration FA-mediated gene expression. may turn translate differences regulation oxidative substrate flux impact insulin sensitivity.
