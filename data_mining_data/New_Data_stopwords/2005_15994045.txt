 Increased hepatic glucose output one major mechanisms hyperglycemia diabetic patients. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), gluconeogenic intermediate, plays critical role hepatic glucose output regulating gluconeogenesis glycolysis liver. Brazilin, active component sappan wood (Caesalpinia sappan), decreases blood glucose diabetic animals. study, effect brazilin gluconeogenic intermediate production enzyme activity examined investigate hypoglycemic mechanism brazilin. Brazilin increased production F-2,6-BP hepatocytes elevating intracellular levels fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) hexose-6-phosphate (H-6-P). Brazilin also found significantly increase activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2) pyruvate kinase glucagon-treated hepatocytes. However, glucose-6-phosphatase activity affected brazilin. data suggests brazilin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis elevating F-2,6-BP level hepatocytes, possibly elevating cellular F-6-P/H-6-P levels PFK-2 activity. Increased pyruvate kinase activity may also play role anti-gluconeogenic action brazilin.
