 INTRODUCTION: Sustained proliferative signaling de-regulated cellular bioenergetics two chief hallmarks cancer. Alterations Ras pathway downstream effectors among major drivers uncontrolled cell growth many cancers. GTPases one signaling molecules activate crucial signal transducing pathways downstream Ras several effector proteins. GTPases (GTP bound) interact several effectors modulate number different biological pathways including regulate cytoskeleton, cellular motility, cytokinesis, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription nuclear signaling. Similarly, altered glycolytic pathway, so-called 'Warburg effect', rewires tumor cell metabolism support biosynthetic requirements uncontrolled proliferation. exists strong evidence critical role glycolytic pathway's rate limiting enzymes promoting immunosuppression. Areas covered: review emerging roles GTPase effector proteins particularly p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4) nicotinamide biosynthetic pathway enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) signaling molecules immune surveillance immune response. Expert opinion: expert opinion article highlight recent information role GTPases metabolic enzymes immune microenvironment propose unique immune therapeutic opportunities.
