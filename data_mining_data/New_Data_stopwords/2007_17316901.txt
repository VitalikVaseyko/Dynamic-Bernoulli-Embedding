 Different values exist glucose metabolism white matter; appears higher measured accumulation 2-deoxyglucose measured formation glutamate isotopically labeled glucose, possibly two methods reflect glycolytic tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activities, respectively. compared glycolytic TCA cycle activity rat white structures (corpus callosum, fimbria, optic nerve) activities parietal cortex, tight glycolytic-oxidative coupling. White structures uptake [(3)H]2-deoxyglucose vivo activities hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase 40-50% values parietal cortex. contrast, formation aspartate [U-(14)C]glucose awake rats (which reflects passage (14)C whole TCA cycle) activities pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, fumarase white structures 10-23% cortical values, optic nerve showing lowest values. data suggest higher glycolytic oxidative metabolism white matter, possibly leading surplus formation pyruvate lactate. Phosphoglucomutase activity, interconverts glucose-6-phosphate glucose-1-phosphate, similar white structures parietal cortex ( approximately 3 nmol/mg tissue/min), spite lower glucose uptake former, suggesting larger fraction glucose converted glucose-1-phosphate white gray matter. However, white matter glycogen synthase level 20-40% cortex, suggesting glucose-1-phosphate destined glycogen formation.
