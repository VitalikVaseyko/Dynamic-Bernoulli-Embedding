 Insulin sensitivity characterized insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism skeletal muscle. hypothesized carbohydrate metabolism storage might transcriptional control. test hypothesis, fed insulin-sensitive males (glucose disposal rate, 14.7 +/- 4.1 mg/kg fat-free mass [FFM] per minute) isoenergetic high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet (HF/LCD) 3 days muscle biopsies intervention. Oligonucleotide microarrays revealed total 369 genes 18861 genes arrays differentially regulated response diet (Bonferonni adjusted P < .01). similar experiment conducted mice 3-week intervention using control group HF/LCD group offset lack control group within human cohort. part analysis results previously published data set, 7 genes carbohydrate metabolism pathway changed response HF/LCD, 3 genes confirmed quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction: fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4 (PDK4), glycogen synthase 1 (muscle). separate experiment, fed C57Bl/6J mice HF/LCD 3 weeks found glucose metabolism genes changed approximately 70% average. Fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4 increased glycogen synthase 1 (muscle) decreased. Combined, results suggest mechanism whereby HF/LCD regulates genes necessary glucose utilization storage vis-a-vis transcriptional control.
