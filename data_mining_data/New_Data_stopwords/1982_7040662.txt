 Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) derivatives types N6-R-ATP [R = (CH2)nNHCOCH2I, (CH2)nNHCO-(CH2)mNHCOCH2I, (CH2)nCON(Me)(CH2)mN(Me)CO(CH2)nNHCOCH2I], N6-Me-N6-R-ATP [R = (CH2)nN-(Me)CO(CH2)mNHCOCH2I], 8-R-ATP [R = NM(CH2)nNHCOCH2I] 5--19 spacer atoms N6 C-8 iodine evaluated potential exo-ATP-site-directed reagents phosphokinases. Substrate inhibitor properties indicated compounds possessed affinity ATP sites muscle (M), kidney (K), liver (L) isozymes rat pyruvate kinase (PK), E. coli thymidine kinase (TK), yeast hexokinase (HK) rat KH I, II, III isozymes. Tests time-dependent loss enzyme activity (inactivation) performed conditions large proportion phosphokinase present enzyme-inhibitor complex. ATP-site-directed inactivations resulted M, L, K isozymes PK exposed 8 h, 22 degrees C, 5 mM levels 18 ATP derivatives 6 analogous ADP derivatives yeast HK rat KH I, II, III exposed 6 h, 22 degrees C, 5 mM levels 28 ATP derivatives. Escherichia coli TK inactivated 6 25 ATP derivatives tested 10 mM, 6 h, 0 degrees C; inactivation slowed MgATP case N6-CH3-N6-R-ATP [R = (CH2)4N(CH3)CO(CH2)5NHCOCH2I]. 1% 298 enzyme-inhibitor combinations exhibited ATP-site-directed inactivation, signifying suitably positioned sufficiently reactive nucleophilic groups present near enzymic ATP sites. Studies shown exo-active-site-directed reagents act isozyme- species-selective enzyme inhibitors. present survey indicates many cases reagents may difficult access data available regarding structural physicochemical features target enzyme adjacent catalytic site.
