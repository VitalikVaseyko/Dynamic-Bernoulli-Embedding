 mechanisms elevated levels free fatty acids cause insulin resistance well understood, strong correlation insulin resistance intramyocellular lipid accumulation skeletal muscle. addition, accumulating evidence suggests link inflammation type 2 diabetes. aim work study whether exposure skeletal muscle cells palmitate affected peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta activity. Here, report exposure C2C12 skeletal muscle cells 0.75 mM palmitate reduced (74%, P<0.01) mRNA levels PPARbeta/delta-target gene pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4), involved fatty acid utilization. reduction observed presence PPARbeta/delta agonist L-165041. drug prevented palmitate-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation. Increased NF-kappaB activity palmitate exposure associated enhanced protein-protein interaction PPARbeta/delta p65. Interestingly, treatment PPARbeta/delta agonist L-165041 completely abolished interaction. results indicate palmitate may reduce fatty acid utilization skeletal muscle cells reducing PPARbeta/delta signaling increased NF-kappaB activity.
