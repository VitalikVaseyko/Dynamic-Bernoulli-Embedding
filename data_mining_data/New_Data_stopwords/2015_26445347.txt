 Tumor tissue composed cancer cells surrounding stromal cells diverse genetic/epigenetic backgrounds, situation known intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Cancer cells surrounded totally different microenvironment normal cells; consequently, tumor cells must exhibit rapidly adaptive responses hypoxia hypo-nutrient conditions. phenomenon changes tumor cellular bioenergetics, called "metabolic reprogramming", recognized one 10 hallmarks cancer. Metabolic reprogramming required malignant transformation tumor development, including invasion metastasis. Although Warburg effect widely accepted common feature metabolic reprogramming, accumulating evidence revealed tumor cells depend mitochondrial metabolism well aerobic glycolysis. Remarkably, cancer-associated fibroblasts tumor stroma tend activate glycolysis autophagy contrast neighboring cancer cells, leads reverse Warburg effect. Heterogeneity monocarboxylate transporter expression reflects cellular metabolic heterogeneity respect production uptake lactate. tumor tissue, metabolic heterogeneity induces metabolic symbiosis, responsible adaptation drastic changes nutrient microenvironment resulting chemotherapy. addition, metabolic heterogeneity responsible failure induce therapeutic effect cancer cells whole. particular, cancer stem cells exhibit several biological features responsible resistance conventional anti-tumor therapies. Consequently, cancer stem cells tend form minimal residual disease chemotherapy exhibit metastatic potential additional metabolic reprogramming. type altered metabolic reprogramming leads adaptive/acquired resistance anti-tumor therapy. Collectively, complex dynamic metabolic reprogramming regarded reflection "robustness" tumor cells unfavorable conditions. review focuses concept metabolic reprogramming heterogeneous tumor tissue, emphasizes importance developing novel therapeutic strategies based drug repositioning.
