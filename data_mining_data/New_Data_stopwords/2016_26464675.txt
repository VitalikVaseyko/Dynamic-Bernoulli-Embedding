 Hexokinase 1 (HK1) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) two key regulators glycosis oncogenic markers cancers. present study, investigated expression profile Western blotting immunohistochemistry determined prognostic values gastric cancer. Expression HK1 PKM2 remarkably increased gastric cancer tissues significantly associated lymphatic metastasis advanced TNM staging. COX regression model, HK1 TNM stage analyzed adverse prognostic indicators gastric cancer. Furthermore, patients HK1 expression showed remarkable shorter survival duration lymphatic metastasis cohort advanced staging cohort. results suggest overexpression PKM2 HK1, especially latter, significantly associates lymphatic metastasis, advanced clinical staging unfavorable prognosis gastric cancer.
