 previously demonstrated rat model chronic uremia liver resistant insulin. investigate mechanism(s) insulin resistance uremia, primary cultures normal rat hepatocytes incubated varying dilutions (1/10 1/10,000) sera undialyzed end stage uremic normal humans 20 hours. studied insulin action, binding, postbinding events. Dilutions uremic sera low 1/1,000 rendered hepatocytes resistant maximal concentrations insulin regard [14C]acetate incorporation lipids. dose response curve insulin-stimulated [14C]aminoisobutyric acid uptake demonstrated shift right hepatocytes incubated uremic sera compared incubated normal sera. 125I-insulin binding sites affinity, 125I-insulin internalization degradation, insulin receptor structure, autophosphorylation insulin receptor, tyrosine-specific kinase activity normal hepatocytes rendered resistant insulin uremic sera. However, cells failed generate chemical mediator second messenger insulin action, assessed ability stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) liver mitochondria normal rats. concluded uremic sera renders normal rat hepatocytes resistant insulin. Insulin resistance postinsulin receptor kinase defect possibly due lack generation chemical mediator insulin action. vitro cell model may useful define mechanism(s) serum factor(s) responsible insulin resistance uremia absence complicating hormonal substrate changes occur vivo.
