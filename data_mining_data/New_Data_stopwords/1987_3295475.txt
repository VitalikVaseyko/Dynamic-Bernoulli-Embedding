 effects chronic renal failure enzyme activity pyruvate kinase mRNA level enzyme studied 7 8 nephrectomized rats. mRNA level measured RNA-DNA dot blot hybridization, using cloned pyruvate kinase cDNA hybridized probe. Neither activity M1-type pyruvate kinase level enzyme rat gastrocnemius muscle affected chronic renal failure, whereas L-type pyruvate kinase enzyme activity uremic rat liver lower control fasted refed states. levels L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA different two groups fasted state. Induction L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA high carbohydrate diet refeeding suppressed proportionally severity chronic renal failure, expressed serum creatinine concentrations (r = -.876, P less .005). results indicate suppression L-type pyruvate kinase activity uremia partly reflected decreased accumulation enzyme mRNA. significantly negative correlation L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA levels plasma glucagon/insulin ratios (r = -.719, P less .05). Hyperglucagonemia uremia might play major role suppression.
