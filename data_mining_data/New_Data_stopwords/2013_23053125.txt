 Recent studies suggest carbohydrate restriction improve training-induced adaptation muscle oxidative capacity. However, importance low muscle glycogen molecular signaling mitochondrial biogenesis remains unclear. Here, compare effects exercise low (LG) normal (NG) glycogen different molecular factors involved regulation mitochondrial biogenesis. Ten highly trained cyclists (VO(2max) 65 +/- 1 ml/kg/min, W max 387 +/- 8 W) exercised 60 min approximately 64 % VO(2max) either low [166 +/- 21 mmol/kg dry weight (dw)] normal (478 +/- 33 mmol/kg dw) muscle glycogen levels achieved prior exercise/diet intervention. Muscle biopsies taken before, 3 h after, exercise. mRNA peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 enhanced greater extent exercise performed low compared normal glycogen levels (8.1-fold vs. 2.5-fold increase). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 mRNA increased LG (1.3- 114-fold increase, respectively), NG. Phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases acetyl-CoA carboxylase changed 3 h post-exercise. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production glutathione oxidative status tended reduced 3 h post-exercise. conclude exercise low glycogen levels amplifies expression major genetic marker mitochondrial biogenesis highly trained cyclists. results suggest low glycogen exercise may beneficial improving muscle oxidative capacity.
