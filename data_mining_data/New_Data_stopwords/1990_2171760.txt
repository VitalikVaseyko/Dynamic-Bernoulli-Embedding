 Clinical photodynamic therapy consists systemic administration derivative hematoporphyrin (Photofrin II) followed exposure malignant lesions continuous visible laser irradiation. investigated effects various modifications laser light delivery efficacy photodynamic therapy controlling R3230AC mammary tumor growth. observed significant delay growth (from initial 2 times initial volume) tumors exposed periodic irradiation (100 mW/cm2/0.25 h, 1-h dark interval, 100 mW/cm2/0.25 h; total fluence, 180 J/cm2), compared untreated controls tumors receiving continuous irradiation total fluence. periodic light treatment regimens, consisting 3-, 6-, 24-hr dark intervals, delayed tumor growth significantly continuous irradiation fluence. biochemical basis sought comparing continuous versus periodic irradiation effects mitochondrial cytosolic enzymes vivo. Although cytochrome c oxidase pyruvate kinase activities reduced dramatically first 24 h continuous periodic irradiation schemes, recovery enzyme activity initial levels took longer periodic irradiation protocol (168 h), compared continuous irradiation regimen (72 h). observed significantly greater delay growth tumors exposed 50 mW/cm2/2 h continuously, compared controls tumors exposed total fluence light delivered 100 200 mW/cm2. data presented indicate efficacy photodynamic therapy could significantly increased modifications delivery photoradiation.
