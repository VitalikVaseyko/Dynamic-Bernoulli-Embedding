 relationship haemoglobin O2 saturation 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (2,3-DPG) haemoglobin solutions equilibrated 3.7% O2-5.7% CO2 identical newborn adult rabbits wide range 2,3-DPG (0.5-40.0 mumol g-1 Hb), independent haemoglobin concentration (1-10 g dl-1). Also, resistance haemoglobin alkali denaturation spectrophotometric absorption spectra carboxy oxyhaemoglobin 500 nm 650 nm, well isoelectric focusing pattern haemoglobin early late stabilization CO, newborn adult animals. demonstrated one dominant band, focusing pH 7.17, one less conspicuous pH 7.40. erythrocyte pH higher newborn adult animals. Isoelectric focusing erythrocyte pyruvate kinase demonstrated two isoenzyme bands newborn animals, one dominant fraction pH 5.85 one minor fraction pH 7.97, whereas pH 7.97 band observed adult. concluded physical properties haemoglobin molecule newborn adult rabbits, postnatal decrease haemoglobin O2 affinity solely due changes erythrocyte metabolism, leading marked rise 2,3-DPG minor decline erythrocyte pH. rise 2,3-DPG caused decrease pyruvate kinase, probably due proteolytic inactivation enzyme.
