 extent growth performance linked digestive energetic capacities early life stages salmonid species investigated. compared two strains Arctic charr known different growth potentials early development (Fraser Yukon gold). Trypsin, lipase, amylase activities whole alevins measured regular intervals hatching 65 days development. assess catabolic ability, also measured five enzymes representing following metabolic pathways: amino acid oxidation (amino aspartate transferase), fatty acid oxidation (beta-hydroxy acyl CoA-dehydrogenase), tricarboxylic acid cycle (citrate synthase), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase), anaerobic glycolysis (lactate dehydrogenase). measurement enzyme activities individual fish allowed clear evaluation digestive capacity relation energetic demand. also compared triploid diploid individuals within Yukon gold strain. whole experimental period, diploid Yukon gold fish exhibited highest growth rate (1.08+/-0.18% length/day) followed triploid Yukon gold fish (1.00+/-0.28% length/day) finally Fraser strain fish (0.84+/-0.28% length/day). differences enzyme activities observed, Fraser strain showed higher enzyme activities given length Yukon gold strain (diploid triploid). Higher growth performance appears linked lower metabolic capacity. results suggest fish may reach important increase ratio digestive catabolic enzyme activities leveling metabolic enzyme activities onset large increases mass.
