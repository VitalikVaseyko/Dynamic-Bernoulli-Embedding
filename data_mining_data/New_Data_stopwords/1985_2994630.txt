 technique described allows preparations hepatocytes, enriched either periportal perivenous hepatocytes ('PP-cells' 'PV-cells' respectively), yield 30-50% compared control cell preparations. liver first perfused 40-60s digitonin (4 mg/ml) destroy selectively either periportal perivenous part microcirculatory unit, remaining hepatocytes isolated ordinary collagenase perfusion technique. periportal cells activities alanine aminotransferase pyruvate kinase 29.4 18.7 mumol/min per mg DNA respectively. rate gluconeogenesis 0.402 mumol/min per mg DNA. perivenous cells corresponding values 9.55, 22.1 0.244 mumol/min per mg DNA respectively. data support concept zonation glucose metabolism within microcirculatory unit liver, afferent part (periportal zone) 2-fold, active gluconeogenesis efferent part (perivenous zone).
