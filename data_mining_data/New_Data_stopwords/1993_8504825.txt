 Metformin (dimethylbiguanide) used 30 years antihyperglycemic agent treatment diabetes mellitus, effect gluconeogenesis still controversial. isolated hepatocytes fasted rats, significant inhibition glucose production lactate/pyruvate (10:1, mol/mol), fructose, alanine glutamine, following metformin addition, observed. Moreover, hepatocytes perifused dihydroxyacetone gluconeogenic substrate treated 0.5 mM metformin, inhibition glucose flux simultaneous stimulation lactate/pyruvate flux observed. enhancement lactate/pyruvate formation appears due effect pyruvate-kinase enzyme. direct effect metformin pyruvate kinase cannot explain result, since pyruvate-kinase activity affected metformin concentration. contrast, addition metformin caused significant decrease cellular ATP concentration, known allosteric inhibitor enzyme. could explain stimulation pyruvate-kinase activity following metformin addition thus inhibition gluconeogenesis.
