 OBJECTIVE: Virginia lines chickens resulted 55 generations artificial selection low (LWS) high (HWS) juvenile body weight. hypothesized relative hyperphagia greater body weight juvenile HWS chickens associated altered fatty acid oxidation efficiency metabolic flexibility tissues associated energy sensing storage, relative cellular hypertrophy white adipose tissue. METHODS: Hypothalamus, liver, pectoralis major, gastrocnemius, abdominal fat, clavicular fat subcutaneous fat collected juvenile (56-65 days old) LWS HWS chickens metabolic, gene expression histological assays. RESULTS: HWS chickens reduced fatty acid oxidation efficiency abdominal fat (P<0.0001) reduced rates oxidation abdominal fat gastrocnemius (P<0.0001) compared LWS. reduced citrate synthase activity white adipose tissue (P<0.0001) greater metabolic inflexibility skeletal muscle (P=0.006) HWS compared LWS. Greater pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) forkhead box O1A (FoxO1) mRNA found skeletal muscle white adipose tissue 56-day-old HWS LWS. Expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) adipose tissue depots greater (P<0.05) LWS HWS chickens. HWS chickens larger (P<0.0001) fewer (P<0.0001) adipocytes per unit area LWS. CONCLUSION: Compared LWS, HWS chickens impaired metabolic flexibility fatty acid oxidation efficiency due greater pyruvate dehydrogenase activity accommodate influx acetyl-CoA fatty acid oxidation skeletal muscle adipose tissue. metabolic adaptations linked differences gene expression regulation, adipocyte cellularity body composition lines, may provide valuable insight metabolic disorders species.
