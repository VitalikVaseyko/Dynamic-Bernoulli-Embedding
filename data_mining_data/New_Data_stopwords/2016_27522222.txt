 Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cardiomyocytes simple morphology fewer membrane structures sarcoplasmic reticulum t-tubules penetrating cytosol. Despite this, intracellular ADP diffusion restricted. Intriguingly, although diffusion restricted, trout cardiomyocytes seem lack coupling mitochondrial creatine kinase (CK) respiration. aim study distribution diffusion restrictions permeabilized trout cardiomyocytes verify role CK. found high activity hexokinase (HK), led us reassess situation trout cardiomyocytes. show diffusion restrictions prominent previously thought. presence competitive ADP-trapping system, ADP produced HK, CK, channeled mitochondria. agreement this, found positively charged mitochondrial CK trout heart homogenate. results best fit simple mathematical model suggesting trout cardiomyocytes lack functional coupling ATPases pyruvate kinase. model simulations show diffusion restricted almost extent cytosol outer mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, confirm HK, CK, functionally coupled respiration. perspective, results suggest across range species, cardiomyocyte morphology metabolism go hand hand cardiac performance, adapted circumstances. Mitochondrial CK coupled respiration adult mammalian hearts, specialized high, sustained performance. HK associates mitochondria hearts trout neonatal mammals, hypoxia-tolerant.
