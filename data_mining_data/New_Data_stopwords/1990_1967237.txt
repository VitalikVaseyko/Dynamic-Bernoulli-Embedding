 Eleven enzymes measured individual fibers soleus tibialis anterior (TA) muscles two flight two control (synchronous) animals. five enzymes glycogenolytic metabolism: phosphorylase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase (group GLY); five oxidative metabolism: citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase, mitochondrial thiolase (group OX); hexokinase, subserving groups. Fiber size (dry weight per unit length) reduced 35% muscles. dry weight basis, hexokinase levels increased 100% flight fibers soleus TA. Group OX enzymes increased 56-193% TA without significant change soleus. Group GLY enzymes increased average 28% soleus fibers underwent, anything, modest decrease (20%) TA fibers. changes composition TA fibers anticipated conversion half originally predominant fast glycolytic fibers fast oxidative glycolytic fibers. Calculation basis fiber length, rather dry weight, gave estimate absolute enzyme changes: hexokinase still calculated increased soleus TA fibers, 50 25%, respectively. Three OX enzymes were, basis, unchanged TA fibers, 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase thiolase still nearly doubled, whereas TA GLY enzymes fallen 40%. soleus fibers, absolute levels OX enzymes decreased average 25% GLY enzymes marginally decreased.
