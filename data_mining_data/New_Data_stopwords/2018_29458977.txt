 INTRODUCTION: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) notoriously difficult diagnose earlier treatable stages, making one deadliest cancers women. Comorbid diabetes associated poor prognosis EOC pro-growth insulin signalling often considered driving factor. However, EOC cells also highly glycolytic insulin-independent glucose uptake essential metabolism. Evidence gluconeogenesis cancer vivo suggests normal concentration circulating glucose meet energy demands tumor may therefore limiting factor cancer cell metabolism. Diabetics elevated blood glucose potential meet energy demands facilitate cancer progression. METHODS: determine whether hyperglycemia potentially modifiable factor independent insulin, orthotopic ovarian tumors induced mice acute Type 1 (hypo-insulinemic) Type 2 (hyper-insulinemic) diabetes. RESULTS: Hyperglycemia accelerated growth ovarian tumors glucose concentration-dependent manner significantly shortened overall survival. Reciprocally, presence tumor improved impaired glucose tolerance Type 1 Type 2 diabetes. mice chronic Type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia limited tumor growth without changing overall survival, indicating systemic metabolic stress accelerate time death independent primary tumor size. modeled vitro, long-term culture 25mM vs 6mM glucose resulted significantly different growth metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, study shows systemic metabolic disturbances profound impact growth ovarian tumors overall survival.
