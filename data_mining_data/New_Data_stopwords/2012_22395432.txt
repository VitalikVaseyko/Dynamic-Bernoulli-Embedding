 recently proposed new two-compartment model understanding Warburg effect tumor metabolism. model, glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate ketone bodies) transferred oxidative epithelial cancer cells, driving OXPHOS mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. termed new cancer paradigm "reverse Warburg effect," stromal cells undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather tumor cells. assess whether mechanism also applies cancer cell metastasis, analyzed bioenergetic status breast cancer lymph node metastases, employing series metabolic protein markers. purpose, used MCT4 identify glycolytic cells. Similarly, used MM20 COX staining markers mitochondrial mass OXPHOS activity, respectively. Consistent "reverse Warburg effect," results indicate metastatic breast cancer cells amplify oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS) adjacent stromal cells glycolytic lack detectable mitochondria. Glycolytic stromal cells included cancer-associated fibroblasts, adipocytes inflammatory cells. Double labeling experiments glycolytic (MCT4) oxidative (TO MM20 COX) markers directly shows least two different metabolic compartments co-exist, side-by-side, within primary tumors metastases. Since cancer-associated immune cells appeared glycolytic, observation may also explain inflammation literally "fuels" tumor progression metastatic dissemination, "feeding" mitochondrial metabolism cancer cells. Finally, MCT4(+) MM20(-) "glycolytic" cancer cells rarely observed, indicating conventional "Warburg effect" frequently occur cancer-positive lymph node metastases.
