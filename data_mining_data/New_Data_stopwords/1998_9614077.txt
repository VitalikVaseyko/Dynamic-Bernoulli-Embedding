 fundamental issue allosteric regulatory enzymes identification pathways signal transmission. Rabbit muscle kidney pyruvate kinase isozymes ideal address issue isozymes exhibit different enzymatic regulatory patterns, sequence differences isozymes identified amino acid residues alter kinetic behavior. earlier study, Cheng et al. (Cheng, X., Friesen, R. H. E., Lee, J. C. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6313-6321), reported effects threonine methionine mutation residue 340 muscle isozyme. study, mutation effected kidney isozyme. Qualitatively, negative effects observed isozymes, namely significant decrease catalytic efficiency decrease apparent affinity phosphoenolpyruvate change affinity ADP, decrease responsiveness presence effectors, activator inhibitor. diversity primary sequence two isozymes alter negative impact T340M mutation, concluded mutation exerts dominant, negative effect. negative effects T340M mutation kinetic properties imply communication residue 340 active site. Residue 340 located 1,4 subunit interface; however, T340M mutation enhances dimerization affinity along 1,2 subunit interface. Thus, study identified communication network among active site, residue 340, 1,2 subunit interface.
