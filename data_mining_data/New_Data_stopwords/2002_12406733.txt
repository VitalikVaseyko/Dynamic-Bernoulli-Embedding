 Pyruvate carboxylase recently sequenced Corynebacterium glutamicum shown play important role anaplerosis central carbon metabolism amino acid synthesis bacteria. study investigate effect overexpression gene pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) physiology C. glutamicum ATCC 21253 ATCC 21799 grown defined media two different carbon sources, glucose lactate. general, physiological effects pyc overexpression Corynebacteria depend genetic background particular strain studied determined large extent interplay pyruvate carboxylase aspartate kinase activities. pyruvate carboxylase activity properly matched aspartate kinase activity, pyc overexpression results growth enhancement instead greater lysine production, despite central role anaplerosis aspartic acid biosynthesis. Aspartate kinase regulation lysine threonine, pyruvate carboxylase inhibition aspartate (shown study using permeabilized cells), well well-established activation pyruvate carboxylase lactate acetyl coenzyme key factors determining effect pyc overexpression Corynebacteria physiology.
