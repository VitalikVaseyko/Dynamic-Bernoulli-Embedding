 Bacillus subtilis KinD signal-transducing histidine kinase part sporulation phosphorelay known regulate important developmental decisions sporulation biofilm formation. determined crystal structures extracytoplasmic sensing domain KinD, copurified crystallized pyruvate ligand. structure ligand-binding site mutant also determined; copurified crystallized acetate ligand. structure KinD extracytoplasmic segment similar several sensing domains signal transduction proteins composed tandem Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)-like domains. KinD ligand-binding site located membrane distal PAS-like domain appears highly selective; single mutation, R131A, abolishes pyruvate binding mutant binds acetate instead. Differential scanning fluorimetry, using variety monocarboxylic dicarboxylic acids, identified pyruvate, propionate, butyrate lactate, acetate, malate KinD ligands. recent report found malate induces biofilm formation KinD-dependent manner. suggested malate might induce metabolic shift increased secretion KinD ligand unknown identity. structure binding assays suggests ligand pyruvate and/or small monocarboxylic acids. summary, study gives first insight identity molecular ligand one five phosphorelay kinases B. subtilis.
