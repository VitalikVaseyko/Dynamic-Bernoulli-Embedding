 levels multimolecular forms pyruvate kinase present four normal human breast specimens, nine benign tissues, 13 malignant breast carcinomas determined. different enzymatic forms separated isoelectrofocusing, quantitated photometrically, characterized kinetic studies using phosphoenolpyruvate variable substrate presence different effectors. correlation specific activity malignancy found. mean specific activities (+/- S.E.) normal, benign, malignant tissues were: 0.078 +/- 0.006, 0.36 +/- 0.072, 3.50 +/- 0.696 IU/mg protein, respectively. form pyruvate kinase isoelectric point (pI) 7.0 predominated breast tissues. properties form consistent K4 isozyme, known widely distributed mammalian tissues. Higher pI forms also found. M4 isozyme, expressed normal muscle brain, pI value similar highest pI form found breast tissues. Therefore, pI data alone suggest breast specimens also express M-type subunits. conclusion supported kinetic data. higher pI forms thought posttranslationally modified K isozyme. Although modified form found normal specimens, seems prevalent neoplasms.
