 aim study investigate whether Portulaca oleracea (PO) extracts hypoxic neuroprotective effects so, mechanism. orally administrated PO extracts distilled water seven days, adult male BALB/c mice adapted normobaric low oxygen environment (10% oxygen 90% nitrogen) different time sacrificed. mouse cortices used histological analysis hematoxylin eosin (H-E staining). activities pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactic acid (LD) level lactate dehydroenase (LDH) ATP detected, mRNA protein levels EPO cortices analyzed. PC-12 cells primarily cultured nerve cells used 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. degree LDH cell culture medium tested. results showed PO extracts enhanced EPO mRNA protein expression mouse cortices. Compared control group, mouse group treated PO extracts 1 g/d significantly higher activities PF, PFK, LDH higher levels ATP cortices, especially hypoxic environment 24 hours. Histological analysis indicated extracts lessened inflammation damage mouse brain. MTT assay results showed PO extracts herb-containing serum raised viability cells tested hypoxic conditions decreased degree LDH culture medium dose-dependent manner. thus demonstrated PO extracts protective effects hypoxic nerve tissue.
