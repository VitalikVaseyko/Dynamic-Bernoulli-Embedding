 1. metabolism glucose glutamine studied small intestine colon rats 4-5 weeks hypothyroidism. 2. Hypothyroidism resulted increases plasma concentrations ketone bodies (P less 0.05), cholesterol (P less 0.001) urea (P less 0.001), decreases plasma concentrations free fatty acids (P less 0.05) triacylglycerol (P less 0.001). changes associated decreases plasma concentrations total tri-iodothyronine, free tri-iodothyronine, total thyroxine free thyroxine. 3. Hypothyroidism decreased DNA content (by 30.5%) protein content (by 23.6%) intestinal mucosa, protein/DNA ratio remaining unchanged. villi jejunum shorter (P less 0.05) crypt depth decreased 26.5% hypothyroid rats. 4. Portal-drained visceral blood flow showed marked change response hypothyroidism, accompanied decreased rates extraction glucose, lactate glutamine release glutamate, alanine ammonia. 5. Enterocytes colonocytes isolated hypothyroid rats showed decreased rates utilization metabolism glucose glutamine. 6. maximal activities hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.28), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.2) phosphate-dependent glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2) decreased intestinal mucosal scrapings hypothyroid rats. Similar decreases obtained colonic mucosal scrapings (except citrate synthase oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) hypothyroid rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
