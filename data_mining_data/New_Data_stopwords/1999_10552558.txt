 appropriate method developed continuous assay sucrose synthase (SS) (EC 2.4.1.13) spectrophotometry. uridine 5'-diphosphate derived sucrose synthesis stoichiometrically coupled oxidation beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide enzymes nucleoside-5'-diphosphate kinase (NDPK), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase. Utilization crude extracts led complete masking SS assay adenylate kinase, adenosine 5'-triphosphatase (ATPase), phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase found crude extracts. interfering enzymes mostly removed crude extracts using combination gel filtration, centrifugation selectively permeable membrane (Biomax-100 Ultrafree centrifugal device), inhibition addition K(2)HPO(4) assay buffer. Sensitivity SS assay significantly increased inclusion NDPK ATP, essential reaction coupling system.
