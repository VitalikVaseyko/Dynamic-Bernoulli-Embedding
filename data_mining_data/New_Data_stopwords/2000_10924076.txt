 Nicotinic acid (niacin) shown decrease myocyte injury. interventions lower cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) ratio improve glycolysis limit infarct size, hypothesized 1) niacin, precursor NAD(+), would lower NADH/NAD(+) ratio, increase glycolysis, limit ischemic injury 2) cardioprotective benefits niacin would limited conditions block lactate removal. Isolated rat hearts perfused without (Ctl) 1 microM niacin (Nia) subjected 30 min low-flow ischemia (10% baseline flow, LF) reperfusion. examine effects limiting lactate efflux, experiments performed 1) Ctl Nia groups subjected zero-flow ischemia 2) Nia group treated lactate-H(+) cotransport inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate LF conditions. Measured variables included ATP, pH, cardiac function, tissue lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (reflecting NADH/NAD(+)), lactate efflux rate, creatine kinase release. lactate-to-pyruvate ratio reduced twofold Nia-LF hearts baseline ischemic conditions (P < 0.001 P < 0.01, respectively), concurrent lower creatine kinase release Ctl hearts (P < 0.05). Nia-LF hearts significantly greater lactate release ischemia (P < 0.05 vs. Ctl hearts) well higher functional recovery relative preservation high-energy phosphates. Inhibiting lactate efflux alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate blocking lactate washout zero flow negated beneficial effects niacin. LF, niacin lowered cytosolic redox state increased lactate efflux, consistent redox regulation glycolysis. Niacin significantly improved functional metabolic parameters conditions, providing additional rationale use niacin therapeutic agent patients ischemic heart disease.
