 Pyruvate kinase glucosephosphate isomerase activities measured liver, heart, gastrocnemius Sprague-Dawley Wistar rats subjected chronic hypoxia. Animals fed Purina chow high sucrose diet. terms changes body weight, Sprague-Dawleys acclimated better Purina chow whereas Wistars adjusted better high sucrose diet. two groups lowest heart weight:body weight ratios. heart enzyme activities levels pair-fed controls strains hypoxia. Diet affected enzyme activities hypoxic animals: rats high sucrose diet, pyruvate kinase activity greater tissues strains except gastrocnemius Sprague-Dawleys; glucosephosphate isomerase higher liver strains gastrocnemius Wistars.
