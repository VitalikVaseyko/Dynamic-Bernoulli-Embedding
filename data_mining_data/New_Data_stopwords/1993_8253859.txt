 Six novel alkaloids contain fused tetracyclic pyrido[2,3,4-kl]acridine ring system purified recently Red Sea purple tunicate Eudistoma sp. Evaluation effects alkaloids cultured neuroblastoma fibroblast cells revealed possess potent growth regulatory properties, affect cell shape adhesion. mouse neuroblastoma cells, Eudistoma alkaloids inhibited cell proliferation induced process differentiation cells flattened onto surface, increased considerably size, extended long neurites. hamster fibroblasts alkaloids slowed cell multiplication, caused exceptional cell flattening elongation. virus-transformed derivative hamster fibroblasts alkaloids restored many aspects normal cell growth morphology. addition, several alkaloids mimicked effects cAMP analogs two well-characterized cAMP-mediated processes involved hepatic glucose metabolism--inhibition pyruvate kinase (PK) activity induction mRNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). effects suggest Eudistoma alkaloids may act cAMP signaling system. However, single application compounds sufficient completely block cell multiplication induce sustain differentiation "reverse transformation". Furthermore, effects readily reversible following removal drugs. contrast, single application agents mimic elevate cAMP induced transient response waned time culture, effects induced constant elevation cAMP reverse rapidly following drug removal. propose Eudistoma alkaloids cause growth inhibition, differentiation, reverse transformation modifying activity state proteins involved regulation cell shape adhesion serve target cAMP and/or second messenger systems.
