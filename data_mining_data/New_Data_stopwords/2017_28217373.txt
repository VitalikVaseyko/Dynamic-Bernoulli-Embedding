 Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases comprise large spectrum clinical conditions ranging indigestion inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) carcinomas. Endoscopy usual method employed diagnose condition. Another noninvasive way assess diagnose GI conditions fecal biomarkers. Fecal biomarkers provide information regarding specific disease process perhaps acceptable clinicians patients alike non-invasivity compared endoscopy. Aim review evaluate current status fecal biomarkers clinical research GI diseases. Multiple types fecal biomarkers discussed review including; markers assess IBD, released results inflammatory insults intestinal epithelia antimicrobial peptides (lactoferrin) inflammation related proteins (calprotectin). markers related function digestion primarily related partially digested food mucosal proteins abnormal amount fecal fat alpha1-antitrypsin, elastase secretary IgA. upcoming fecal biomarker like M2 pyruvate kinase neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin discussed well. Apart mention, fecal biomarkers exploration possible clinical use future also discussed. include cathelicidins, osteoprotegerin, beta-glucuronidase, Eosinophil proteins, etc.
