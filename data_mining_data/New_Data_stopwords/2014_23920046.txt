 UNLABELLED: Diagnosing primary mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) dysfunction long relied invasive tissue biopsies, since blood-based biomarker shown sufficiently high sensitivity specificity across myriad individual clinical presentations. sought determine whether cohort-level evaluation commonly obtained blood analytes might reveal consistent patterns discriminate heterogenous group primary mitochondrial RC disease subjects control individuals subjects pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. METHODS: Following IRB approval, 62 biochemical analyte concentrations ratios retrospectively analyzed three well-defined intentionally heterogeneous subject cohorts reflective clinical practice: [1] Primary mitochondrial disease (n=19); [2] pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (n=4); [3] controls (n=27). Blood analyte categories included comprehensive chemistry profile, creatine kinase, lipoprotein profile, lactate, pyruvate, plasma amino acid profile. Non-parametric analyses used compare median analyte level cohorts. RESULTS: Disease cohorts differed significantly median levels triglycerides, lactate, pyruvate, multiple individual plasma amino acids. Primary mitochondrial disease significantly discriminated cohort level pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency greater pyruvate alanine elevation pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, well significantly increased branched chain amino acid (BCAA) levels increased ratios individual BCAAs glutamate mitochondrial disease. addition, significant elevation median blood triglyceride level seen primary mitochondrial disease cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Blood metabolite profile analysis discriminate heterogeneous cohort primary mitochondrial disease controls pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Elevated BCAA levels, either absolutely considered relative level glutamate, common metabolic sequelae primary mitochondrial RC disease. Prospective study needed validate observed plasma metabolite alterations potential biomarker disease larger cohorts individual subject level.
