 1. Mesophyll parenchyma-sheath chloroplasts maize leaves separated density fractionation non-aqueous media. 2. investigation distribution photosynthetic enzymes indicated mesophyll chloroplasts probably contain entire leaf complement pyruvate,P(i) dikinase, NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase, glycerate kinase nitrite reductase adenylate kinase pyrophosphatase. fractionation pattern phosphopyruvate carboxylase suggested enzyme may associated bounding membrane mesophyll chloroplasts. 3. Ribulose diphosphate carboxylase, ribose phosphate isomerase, phosphoribulokinase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, alkaline fructose diphosphatase NADP-specific ;malic' enzyme appear wholly localized parenchyma-sheath chloroplasts. Phosphoglycerate kinase NADP-specific glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, hand, distributed approximately equally two types chloroplast. 4. exposure illuminated leaves (14)CO(2) 25sec., labelled malate, aspartate 3-phosphoglycerate similar fractionation patterns, large proportion isolated mesophyll chloroplasts. Labelled fructose phosphates ribulose phosphates mainly isolated fractions containing parenchyma-sheath chloroplasts, dihydroxyacetone phosphate fractionation pattern intermediate C(4) dicarboxylic acids sugar phosphates. 6. results indicate mesophyll parenchyma-sheath chloroplasts co-operative function operation C(4)-dicarboxylic acid pathway. Possible routes transfer carbon C(4) dicarboxylic acids sugars discussed.
