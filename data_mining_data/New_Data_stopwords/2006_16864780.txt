 High-throughput screening (HTS) chemical compounds identify modulators molecular targets mainstay pharmaceutical development. Increasingly, HTS used identify chemical probes gene, pathway, cell functions, ultimate goal comprehensively delineating relationships chemical structures biological activities. Achieving goal require methodologies efficiently generate pharmacological data primary screen reliably profile range biological activities associated large chemical libraries. Traditional HTS, tests compounds single concentration, suited task, HTS burdened frequent false positives false negatives requires extensive follow-up testing. developed paradigm, quantitative HTS (qHTS), tested enzyme pyruvate kinase, generate concentration-response curves >60,000 compounds single experiment. show method precise, refractory variations sample preparation, identifies compounds wide range activities. Concentration-response curves classified rapidly identify pyruvate kinase activators inhibitors variety potencies efficacies elucidate structure-activity relationships directly primary screen. Comparison qHTS traditional single-concentration HTS revealed high prevalence false negatives single-point screen. study demonstrates feasibility qHTS accurately profiling every compound large chemical libraries (>10(5) compounds). qHTS produces rich data sets immediately mined reliable biological activities, thereby providing platform chemical genomics accelerating identification leads drug discovery.
