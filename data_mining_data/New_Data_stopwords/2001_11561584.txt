 computer program (BIOKINFIT) developed estimate microbial enzyme kinetic parameters progress curve data nonlinear regression. BIOKINFIT overcomes limitations associated parameter estimation nonlinear equations implicit dependent variable numerically approximating substrate concentration integrated kinetic expressions. simplex method used minimize error experimentally observed theoretically predicted substrate depletion data. robustness approach initially verified using synthetic substrate depletion data characterized either simple relative errors known magnitude. Subsequently, previously published data three different experiments including pyruvate kinase reaction, 2-chlorophenol biodegradation, glucose uptake Penicillium chrysogenum used verify utility present approach kinetic parameter estimation. cases, experimental substrate depletion data accurately described theoretical curves kinetic parameter estimates obtained study using simplex method close agreement reported previously. BIOKINFIT, available free charge request, offers convenient robust method analyzing progress curve data implicit kinetic expressions.
