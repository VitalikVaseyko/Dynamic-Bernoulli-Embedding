 Cancer cells characterized altered glucose metabolism known Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis increased. Glucose converted lactate even sufficient oxygen tension. Interfering process may potential effective strategy cause cancer cell death cells rely heavily glucose metabolism survival proliferation. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), glucose analog, targets glucose metabolism deplete cancer cells energy. addition, 2DG increases oxidative stress, inhibits N-linked glycosylation, induces autophagy. efficiently slow cell growth potently facilitate apoptosis specific cancer cells. Although 2DG limited therapeutic effect many types cancers, may combined therapeutic agents radiotherapy exhibit synergistic anticancer effect. review, describe Warburg effect discuss 2DG underlying mechanisms potential application cancer treatment.
