 new mutant red cell PK associated mild chronic haemolytic anaemia described. propositus, double heterozygous maternal gene coding structural abnormal enzyme paternal gene coding catalitically inactive enzyme, suitable accurate functional characterization PK variant since erythrocytes contained one active mutant form enzyme. active isoenzyme characterized low activity, decreased affinity phosphoenolpyruvate, incomplete fructose-1,6-diphosphate activation, increased 'zero-time transition temperature', increased stability guanidine-HCl storage +4 degrees C, increased guanosine-5'-diphosphate cytidine-5'-diphosphate utilization, altered electrophoretic pattern single slow-moving component abnormal isoelectric point. Affinity ADP, ATP inhibition, optimum pH, molecular weight subunits, antigen concentration immunological properties normal range.
