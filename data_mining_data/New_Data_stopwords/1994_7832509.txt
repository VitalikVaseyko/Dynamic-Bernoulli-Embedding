 Although E. coli central metabolism studied several decades, many regulatory features still unknown. achieve goal rational manipulation cellular metabolism, important understand E. coli responds overexpressed enzymes. studying biochemical control fluxes PEP, pyruvate, OAA, addressed fundamental questions may prove essential applications metabolic engineering. First, found simultaneous overexpression Pck Ppc, Pps alone presence glucose leads phenotypes consistent futile cycline. contrast expectation, futile cycling per se affect growth rate significantly. However, excessive futile cycling may cause competitive disadvantage natural environment. Overexpression Pck caused growth inhibition futile cycling. Therefore, E. coli controls expression gluconeogenic enzymes avoid excessive futile cycling, also prevent toxicity effects. metabolic engineering, futile cycling may used strategy stimulate metabolism either production metabolites digestion toxic wastes. Second, found expression levels Pps Pck E. coli optimal growth pyruvate succinate, respectively. Overexpression enzymes increases growth rate pyruvate succinate, respectively, indicating slow growth rates substrates least partially caused insufficient supply PEP derivatives. Moreover, E. coli also optimized Ppc level optimal growth yield glucose uncontrolled batch cultures. results demonstrate central metabolism optimized growth defined laboratory conditions. Thus, possibility exists adjustment native enzyme levels central metabolism improve bioreactor performance. Third, found overexpression Pck affects transcriptional levels unrelated genes. example indicates physiological responses enzyme (over)expression interpreted cautiously, changing expression level specific enzyme may affect many unlinked genes. Similar results also obtained use two-dimensional electrophoresis proteins E. coli. Although questions remain answered, fast progress area metabolic engineering expected near future.
