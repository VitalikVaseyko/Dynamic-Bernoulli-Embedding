 member sirtuins family, also called Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs), SIRT6 many catalytic enzyme activities plays pivotal role biological processes including anti-aging, chromatin regulation, transcriptional control, glucose lipid metabolism, DNA damage repair. Recently, increasing evidences indicated SIRT6 related initiation development tumors, hepatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer genital system tumors. However, SIRT6 might play dual role tumorigenesis progression. SIRT6 often acted tumor suppressor, might play oncogenic role. Based current study, depicted essential roles SIRT6 initiation progression various tumors, summarized mode actions, might provide clues cancer therapy.
