 INTRODUCTION: Evaluation red blood cell (RBC) morphology important first step differential diagnosis hereditary hemolytic anemia. is, however, labor intensive, expensive, prone subjectivity. improve standardize analysis RBC morphology screening tool diagnosis hereditary hemolytic anemia, studied automated analysis digital microscopy (DM). METHODS: Blood 90 patients hereditary hemolytic anemia 32 normal control subjects analyzed CellaVision DM96 Digital Microscope. RESULTS: hemolytic RBC abnormalities could distinguished presence least one aberrant red cell type. particular, percentage microcytes highly sensitive specific (AUCROC = 0.97) RBC membrane disorders, cut-off 5.7% microcytes calculated optimal distinguish patients healthy controls. Subgroup analysis patients RBC membrane disorders revealed additional distinct differences according underlying gene defect. number cell types significantly elevated sickle cell anemia patients, polychromatic cells, macrocytes, poikilocytes. increase helmet cells (AUCROC = 0.96) hypochromic cells (AUCROC = 0.91) specific beta-thalassemia, whereas patients pyruvate kinase deficiency showed significant increased polychromatic cells, macrocytes, ovalocytes. Patients hereditary xerocytosis showed significantly higher numbers polychromatic cells, macrocytes, target cells. CONCLUSION: DM holds promise useful screening tool diagnosis hereditary hemolytic anemia detecting quantifying distinct morphological changes RBCs patients various forms hereditary hemolytic anemia.
