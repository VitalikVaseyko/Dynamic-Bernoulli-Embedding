 Glucose metabolism mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generation adenosine triphosphate (ATP) vital cell function. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-product OXPHOS, major source endogenously produced toxic stressors genome. fact, ATP could efficiently produced high throughput manner without ROS generation cytosol glycolysis, could unique critical metabolic pathway prevent spontaneous mutation DNA replication. Therefore glycolysis dominant robust proliferating cells. Indeed, aerobic glycolysis, Warburg effect, normal proliferating cells example homeostasis redox status transiently shifting metabolic flux OXPHOS glycolysis avoid ROS generation DNA synthesis protect genome integrity. process maintaining redox homeostasis driven genome wide transcriptional clustering mitochondrial retrograde signaling coupled glucose metabolic pathway cell division cycle. contrary, Warburg effect cancer cells results alteration redox status reprogramed glucose metabolic pathway caused dysfunctional OXPHOS. Mutations mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nuclear DNA (nDNA) disrupt mitochondrial structural integrity, leading reduced OXPHOS capacity, sustained glycolysis excessive ROS leak, responsible tumor initiation, progression metastasis. "plumbing model" used illustrate redox status could regulated glucose metabolic pathway provide new insight understanding Warburg effect normal cancer cells.
