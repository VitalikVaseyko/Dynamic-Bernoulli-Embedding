 Trypanosoma brucei contains two tandemly arranged genes glycerol kinase. downstream gene analysed detail. contains ORF polypeptide 512 amino acids. polypeptide calculated molecular mass 56 363 Da pI 8.6. Comparison T. brucei glycerol kinase amino-acid sequence glycerol kinase sequences available databases revealed positional identities 39.0-50.4%. T. brucei glycerol kinase gene overexpressed Escherichia coli cells recombinant protein obtained purified characterized biochemically. kinetic properties regard forward reverse reaction measured. values corresponded determined previously natural glycerol kinase purified parasite, confirmed apparent Km values trypanosome enzyme substrates relatively high compared glycerol kinases. Alignment amino-acid sequences T. brucei glycerol kinase eukaryotic prokaryotic glycerol kinases, well inspection available three-dimensional structure E. coli glycerol kinase showed residues magnesium-, glycerol- ADP-binding sites well conserved T. brucei glycerol kinase. However, number remarkable substitutions identified, could responsible low affinity substrates. striking amino-acid Ala137 T. brucei glycerol kinase; organisms serine present corresponding position. mutated Ala137 T. brucei glycerol kinase serine mutant glycerol kinase over-expressed purified. affinity mutant enzyme substrates glycerol glycerol 3-phosphate appeared 3. 1-fold 3.6-fold higher wild-type enzyme. Part glycerol kinase gene comprising residue 137 amplified eight different kinetoplastid species sequenced. Interestingly, alanine occurs T. brucei, also trypanosomatids convert glucose equimolar amounts glycerol pyruvate: T. gambiense, T. equiperdum T. evansi. trypanosomatids limited capacity produce glycerol, hydroxy group-containing residue found organisms: T. vivax T. congolense possess serine Phytomonas sp., Leishmania brasiliensis L. mexicana threonine.
