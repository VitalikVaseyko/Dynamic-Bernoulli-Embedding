 Enzymes glycolytic pathway well ancillary enzymes studied normal red cells parasitized Plasmodium falciparum culture varying parasitemias well isolated parasites. levels enzymes except diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase elevated. Extreme elevations hexokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, adenosine deaminase concentrations noted. cases, electrophoretically distinct bands enzyme activity also seen. findings partly explain previously noted 50- 100-fold increase glucose consumption infected red cells suggest knowledge parasite enzymes genetic basis may aid designing new chemotherapy understanding evolution parasites.
