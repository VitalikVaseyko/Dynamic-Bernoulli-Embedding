 high glucose consumption tumor cells even oxygen-rich environment, referred Warburg effect, noted nearly universal biochemical characteristic cancer cells. Targeting glycolysis pathway explored anti-cancer therapeutic strategy eradicate cancer based fundamental biochemical property cancer cells. Oncoproteins Akt c-Myc regulate cell metabolism. Accumulating studies uncovered various molecular mechanisms oncoproteins affect cellular metabolism, raising concern whether targeting glycolysis equally effective treating cancers arising different oncogenic activities. Here, established dual-regulatable FL5.12 pre-B cell line myristoylated Akt expressed control doxycycline, c-Myc, fused hormone-binding domain human estrogen receptor, activated 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Using system, directly compared effect oncoproteins cell metabolism isogenic background. Activation either Akt c-Myc leads Warburg effect indicated increased cellular glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate generation. cells treated glycolysis inhibitors, Akt sensitizes cells apoptosis, whereas c-Myc not. contrast, c-Myc Akt sensitizes cells inhibition mitochondrial function. correlated enhanced mitochondrial activities c-Myc cells. Hence, although Akt c-Myc promote aerobic glycolysis, differentially affect mitochondrial functions render cells susceptible perturbation cellular metabolic programs.
