 Enzymes representative of, related to, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle demonstrated supernatant lamellar fractions Anabaena cylindrica cultured presence atmospheric nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing ammonia-assimilating algae contained essentially similar levels enzymes tested, notable exception glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase showed increased NADPH-linked activity concomitant diminution NADH-linked activity ammonia supplied. provision nitrite nitrate caused significant enhancements glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, related hexokinase phosphohexoisomerase. Reduced activities pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, NADH NADPH oxidoreductases recorded nitrate-grown alga.The stimulation pentose phosphate pathway, partial expense glycolysis tricarboxylic acid cycle, algae cultured nitrite nitrate interpreted due additional NADPH requirements imposed induced nitrite reductase. Modification pyridine nucleotide linkage glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase oxidoreductases attributed diversion reductant nitrite nitrate reductases nitrogenase. results considered indicate regulation blue-green algal metabolism determined availability pyridine nucleotides.
