 review discusses effects lactate pyruvate, high glucose peritoneal dialysis solutions (PDS) leukocytes, mainly intracellular pH ([pH](i)), glucose metabolic pathways, apoptosis. Lactate-based PDS (L-PDS) bioincompatible primarily due low pH, high lactate, glucose excess individual combination. High lactate acidi milieu would induce severe intracellular acidosis leukocytes, high glucose may disturb glucose metabolic pathways activate protein kinase C (PKC) nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) cells, leading apoptosis. Pyruvate-based PDS (P-PDS) novel experimental PDS. Evidence shows P-PDS superior biocompatibility. Pyruvate protection cells confirmed many fields besides PDS area. Although underlying mechanism whereby P-PDS preserve cell function fully understood, may associated maintenance [pH](i) close physiological, due low buffering capacity, improvement cellular glucose metabolic pathways redox state, sustainment intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis high glucose concentrations. may also inhibit PKC NF-kappaB activation high glucose. addition, pyruvate strong antioxidant, scavenger hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, exogenous pyruvate PDS could energy source cells also Crabtree effect might occur neutrophils. Pyruvate hopeful candidate buffers PDS near future. observation P-PDS strongly needed peritoneal cells verify cell protection vitro vivo clinic trials.
