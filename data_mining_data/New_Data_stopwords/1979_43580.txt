 exhaustive exercise muscular store creatine phosphate (CP) almost completely depleted. resynthesis CP recovery normally occurs rapidly, totally inhibited local circulation muscle occluded. limiting factor CP resynthesis could low intramuscular pH availability oxygen investigated present study. Biopsies musculis quadriceps femoris man analyzed pH, ATP, ADP, CP, creatine, lactate pyruvate. shown resynthesis CP occurs blood supply muscle intact. concluded creatine kinase reaction steady state equilibrium period recovery. influence oxygen resynthesis CP investigated incubating muscle samples taken fatiguing isometric contraction atmospheres oxygen nitrogen, respectively. 15 min incubation oxygen CP resynthesized starting value 4% 68% normal value rest. resynthesis observed parallel muscle samples incubated time nitrogen. suggested initial fast phase CP resynthesis limited availability oxygen whereas subsequent slow phase limited hydrogen ion transport muscle.
