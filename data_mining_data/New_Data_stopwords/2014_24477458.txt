 Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized high levels glycolysis, even presence oxygen, important hallmark cancer. metabolic reprogramming referred Warburg effect essential survival tumor cells provides substrates required biomass generation. Molecular mechanisms responsible shift glucose metabolism remain elusive. described herein, found aberrant expression proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 (TG2) important regulator Warburg effect mammary epithelial cells. Mechanistically, TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming constitutively activating nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, binds hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha promoter induces expression even normoxic conditions. TG2/NF-kappaB-induced increase HIF-1alpha expression associated increased glucose uptake, increased lactate production decreased oxygen consumption mitochondria. Experimental suppression TG2 attenuated HIF-1alpha expression reversed downstream events mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, downregulation p65/RelA HIF-1alpha expression cells restored normal glucose uptake, lactate production, mitochondrial respiration glycolytic protein expression. results suggest aberrant expression TG2 master regulator metabolic reprogramming facilitates metabolic alterations epithelial cells even normoxic conditions. TG2-induced shift glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells survive stressful conditions promotes metastatic competence.
