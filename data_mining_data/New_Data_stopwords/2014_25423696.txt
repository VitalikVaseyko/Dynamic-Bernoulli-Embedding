 "Warburg effect" emphasizes malignant cells exhibit active glycolysis even aerobic conditions. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) key glycolytic enzyme helps exhibit "Warburg effect". present study, main aim detect expression HK2 epithelial ovarian tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry qRT-PCR used examine expression HK2 different epithelial ovarian tissues. expression HK2 ovarian cancer tissues significantly higher normal ovarian, benign, borderline tumors protein (p < 0.001) mRNA (p < 0.05) levels. HK2 expression significantly higher Stage III/IV compared Stage III (p < 0.001). Expression HK2 poorly-differentiated carcinoma higher well-differentiated carcinoma (p = 0.008). level HK2 higher serous groups non-serous groups protein (p = 0.008) mRNA (p < 0.05) level. Collectively, HK2 highly expressed epithelial ovarian cancer, especially serous groups. expression related clinical stage histological differentiation.
