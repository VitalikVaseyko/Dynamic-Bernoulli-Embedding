 BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas, glibenclamide, antidiabetic drugs stimulate beta-cell insulin secretion binding sulfonylureas receptors (SURs) adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). Glibenclamide may also cardiotoxic, effect ascribed interference protective function cardiac KATP channels glibenclamide high affinity. Prompted recent evidence glibenclamide impairs energy metabolism renal cells, investigated whether drug also affects metabolism cardiac cells. METHODS: cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2 treated 24 h glibenclamide metformin, known inhibitor mitochondrial respiratory chain. Cell viability evaluated sulforodhamine B assay. ATP AMP measured according enzyme coupling method oxygen consumption using amperometric electrode, Fo-F1 ATP synthase activity assay evaluated chemiluminescent method. Protein expression measured western blot. RESULTS: Glibenclamide deregulated energy balance H9c2 cardiomyoblasts way similar metformin. inhibited mitochondrial complexes I, II III ensuing impairment oxygen consumption ATP synthase activity, ATP depletion increased AMPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, glibenclamide disrupted mitochondrial subcellular organization. perturbation mitochondrial energy balance associated enhanced anaerobic glycolysis, increased activity phosphofructo kinase, pyruvate kinase lactic dehydrogenase. Interestingly, additive effects glibenclamide metformin observed. CONCLUSIONS: Glibenclamide deeply alters cell metabolism cardiac cells impairing mitochondrial organization function. may explain risk cardiovascular events associated use drug, alone combination metformin.
