 Two-component systems (TCSs) dictate many bacterial responses environmental change via activation membrane-embedded sensor kinase, molecular specificity cognate response regulator protein. However, although majority TCSs operate seemingly strict cognate protein-protein interactions, several reports TCSs violate classical model signal transduction. group recently demonstrated cross-interacting TCSs function manner imparts fitness advantage bacterial pathogens. study, describe interconnectivity metabolite-sensing TCSs YpdA/YpdB BtsS/BtsR uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). YpdA/YpdB BtsS/BtsR TCSs previously reported interact K12 E. coli, alter expression putative transporter genes yhjX yjiY, respectively. target genes upregulated UPEC acute chronic murine models urinary tract infection, well response pyruvate serine added growth media vitro. Here, show proper regulation yhjX UPEC requires presence components TCSs. utilizing plasmid-encoded luciferase reporters tracking activity yhjX yjiY promoters, demonstrate deletions one TCS substantially alter transcriptional activity opposing system's target gene. However, unlike K12 E. coli, single gene deletions YpdA/YpdB system alter yjiY gene expression UPEC, suggesting niche lifestyle-specific pressures may selecting differential cross-regulation TCSs pathogenic non-pathogenic E. coli.
