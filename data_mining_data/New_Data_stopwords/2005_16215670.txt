 Aberrant overexpression antiapoptotic members Bcl-2 protein family contributes resistance anticancer therapeutic drugs. Thus, protein represent attractive target novel anticancer agents. present study, determined effect anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 caspase-3 activation, PLC-gamma1 degradation Akt activation various anticancer agents-induced apoptosis. Treatment chrysin 12 h produced morphological features apoptosis U937 cells, associated caspase-3 activation PLC-gamma1 degradation. Induction apoptosis also accompanied down-regulation XIAP inactivation Akt. Chrysin-induced caspase-3 activation, PLC-gamma1 degradation apoptosis significantly attenuated Bcl-2 overexpressing U937/Bcl-2 cells. Ectopic expression Bcl-2 appeared inhibit ceramide-, Akt specific inhibitor (SH-6)-induced apoptosis sustained Akt activation. Thus, findings imply biological functions Bcl-2 may attributed ability inhibit anticancer agents-induced apoptosis sustained Akt activation.
