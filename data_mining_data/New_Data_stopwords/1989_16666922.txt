 Brassica nigra leaf petiole suspension cells subjected 7 days inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation extractable activity of: (a) pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, nonphosphorylating NADP-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase increased least fivefold, (b) phosphorylating NAD-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased sixfold, (c) ATP:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, NAD malic enzyme altered. Pi deprivation also resulted significant reductions extractable levels Pi, ATP, ADP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, soluble protein, caused sixfold elevation free amino acid concentrations. change inorganic pyrophosphate concentration observed following Pi starvation. hypothesized pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, nonphosphorylating NADP-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase bypass nucleotide phosphate Pi-dependent glycolytic reactions sustained periods Pi depletion.
