 Exposure single 0.5Gy X-ray dose eggs 48h fertilisation (48h egg), eyed eggs, yolk sac larvae (YSL) first feeders induces legacy effect adult rainbow trout. includes transmission bystander effect non-irradiated adult trout swam irradiated fish. aim study investigate legacy analysing gill proteome irradiated bystander fish. Irradiation early life stages resulted changes proteins play key role development also known anti-tumorigenic anti-oxidant: upregulation haemoglobin subunit beta (48h egg), haemoglobin, serum albumin 1 precursor (eyed eggs), clathrin heavy chain 1 isoform X10 (eyed eggs first feeders), actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (first feeders), downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase, histone 1 (48h egg), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), collagen alpha-1(1) chain like proteins (YSL), pyruvate kinase PKM-like protein (YSL first feeders), ubiquitin-40S ribosomal proteins S27 eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 1B (first feeders). However irradiation YSL first feeders (post hatching early life stages) also induced proteomic changes complex relationship tumorigenesis cancer progression; downregulation alpha-1-antiprotease-like protein precursor, vigilin isoform X2 nucleoside diphosphate kinase (YSL) upregulation hyperosmotic glycine rich protein (first feeders). bystander fish proteomic changes similar induced irradiation: upregulation haemoglobin subunit beta (48h egg), haemoglobin (eyed eggs), actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4, hyperosmotic glycine rich protein (first feeders), downregulation alpha-1-antiprotease-like protein, vigilin isoform X2, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (YSL), pyruvate kinase PKM-like protein ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a-like (first feeders). proteomic changes unique bystander fish; downregulation TPI, ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S2 (eyed egg), cofilin-2, cold-inducible RNA-binding protein B-like isoform X3 (YSL) superoxide dismutase (first feeder), upregulation haemoglobin subunit alpha, collagen 1a1 precursor, apolipoprotein A-1-1 A-1-2 precursor (first feeders). bystander effect proteomic changes shown overwhelmingly anti-tumorigenic protective fish gill.
