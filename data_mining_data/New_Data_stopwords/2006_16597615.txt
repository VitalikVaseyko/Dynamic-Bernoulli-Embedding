 Hypoxia suspected trigger transdifferentiation renal tubular cells myofibroblasts epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. determine functional networks potentially altered hypoxia, rat renal tubule suspensions incubated three conditions oxygenation ranging normoxia (lactate uptake) severe hypoxia (lactate production). Transcriptome changes 4 h analyzed high scale restriction fragment differential display. Among 1,533 transcripts found, 42% maximally expressed severe hypoxia 8% mild hypoxia (Po(2) = 48 mmHg), suggesting two different levels oxygen sensing. Normoxia required full expression proximal tubule-specific transcripts 25-hydroxyvitamin 1-hydroxylase (Cyp27b1) l-pyruvate kinase (Pklr), transcripts involved tissue cohesion fibronectin (Fn1) N-cadherin (Cdh2), non-muscle-type myosin transcripts. Mild hypoxia increased myogenin transcript level. Conversely, severe hypoxia increased transcripts involved extracellular matrix remodeling, muscle-type myosins, others involved creatine phosphate synthesis lactate transport (Slc16a7). Accordingly, microscopy showed loss tubule aggregation hypoxia, without tubular disruption. Hypoxia also increased levels kidney-specific transcripts normally restricted less oxygenated medullary zone others specific distal part nephron. conclude extensive oxygen supply kidney tubule favors expression differentiated functions specifically proximal tubule, whose embryonic origin mesenchymal. phenotype changes could potentially permit transient adaptation hypoxia also favor pathological processes tissue invasion.
