 glucose transporter GLUT1 frequently overexpressed tumor tissues rapidly proliferating cancer cells rely primarily glycolysis, low-efficiency metabolic pathway necessitates high rate glucose consumption. blocking GLUT1 promising anticancer strategy, developed novel class GLUT1 inhibitors based 4-aryl-substituted salicylketoxime scaffold. compounds efficient inhibitors glucose uptake lung cancer cells notable antiproliferative effect. contrast 5-aryl-substituted regioisomers, newly synthesized compounds reported herein display significant binding estrogen receptors. inhibition glucose uptake cancer cells compounds observed fluorescence microscopy imaging using fluorescent analogue glucose. Therefore, blocking ability tumor cells take glucose means small molecules, optimized derivatives, may successful approach development novel anticancer drugs.
