 Polymeric black tea polyphenols (PBPs) shown possess anti-tumor-promoting effects two-stage skin carcinogenesis. However, mechanisms action fully elucidated. study, mechanisms PBP-mediated antipromoting effects investigated mouse model employing tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Compared controls, single topical application TPA mouse skin increased translocation protein kinase C (PKC) cytosol membrane. Pretreatment PBPs 1-3 decreased TPA-induced translocation PKC isozymes (alpha, beta, eta, gamma, epsilon) cytosol membrane, whereas PBPs 4 5 less effective. levels PKCs delta zeta cytosol/membrane similar treatment groups. Complementary confocal microscopic evaluation showed decrease TPA-induced PKCalpha fluorescence PBP-3-pretreated membranes, whereas pretreatment PBP-5 show similar decrease. Based experiments specific enzyme inhibitors phosphospecific antibodies, PBP-3 PBP-5 observed decrease TPA-induced level and/or activity phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) AKT1 (pS473). additional ability PBP-3 inhibit site-specific phosphorylation PKCalpha three positions responsible activation [PKCalpha (pT497), PKC PAN (betaII pS660), PKCalpha/betaII (pT638/641)] AKT1 Thr308 position, along decrease TPA-induced PDK1 protein level, correlated inhibition translocation PKC, may impart relatively stronger chemoprotective activity PBP-3 PBP-5. Altogether, PBP-mediated decrease TPA-induced PKC phosphorylation correlated well decreased TPA-induced NF-kappaB phosphorylation downstream target proteins associated proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation mouse skin. Results suggest antipromoting effects PBPs due modulation TPA-induced PI3K-mediated signal transduction.
