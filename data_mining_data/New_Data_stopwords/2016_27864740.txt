 Disruption epigenetic regulation characteristic metabolic alterations (known Warburg-effect) well-known hallmarks cancer. study investigated expression levels microRNAs histone deacetylase enzymes via RT-qPCR bone marrow specimens adult patients suffering hematological malignancies (total cohort n = 40), especially acute myeloid leukemia (n = 27). levels three examined Warburg-effect related microRNAs (miR-378*, miR-23b, miR-26a) positively correlated oncogenic miR-155 miR-125b, negatively level tumorsuppressor miR-124. Significant relationships confirmed levels SIRT6, HDAC4 microRNAs listed above. NPM1-mutated AML (n = 6), level miR-125b significantly lower group AML patients carrying mutation (n = 13) (p < 0.05). M5 FAB type AML (n = 5), level miR-124 significantly higher compared M2 group (n = 7) (p < 0.05). two cases FAB M5 AML, levels SIRT6 miR-26a increased first 4 weeks treatment. total cohort, white blood cell count time diagnosis significantly correlated levels HDAC4, SIRT6, miR-124 miR-26a. results suggest Warburg-effect related microRNAs may important role pathogenesis leukemia, potential oncogenic property HDAC4 SIRT6 cannot excluded hematological malignancies. Elevated level miR-125b contribute adverse prognosis AML without NPM1 mutation. prevailment tumorsuppressor property miR-124 may depend accompanying genetic alterations.
