 satisfactory explanation offered, date, account prevalence haemochromatosis genes European population yet relative paucity gene tropics. Traditional wisdom suggests that, antiquity, haemochromatosis gene, promotes iron absorption, would protected ancient man iron loss resulting injury either hunting war. However, advantage would equally desirable populations incidence alleles negligible. Others tackled polemic another view, postulating paucity haemochromatosis alleles populations outside Europe may explained fact iron load predisposes infection iron deficiency anaemia protective limiting parasitic access host stores iron. explanation alone equally unsatisfactory European populations exposed pathogens would benefit protection afforded mild anaemia. Others mooted genetic drift another alternative explanation. Yet would unexpected gene deleterious. propose driving force propagation haemochromatosis alleles infection per se nature parasitic fauna sojourned mankind. tropics inhabited multicellular parasitic highly pathogenic organisms, consequently high demand iron. organisms developed aggressive means iron extraction hosts. iron abundance organisms would licence multiply unbridled fashion expense host. host, due increased iron load, would able harbour high parasitic load would harmful population whole, individual haemochromatosis allele. man migrated tropics many larger pathogens disappeared man contend traditional unicellular adversaries. Iron critical micronutrient host attempts withhold invading pathogens. also advance theory tropical anaemias including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency ingenious evolutionary means host withholding iron tropical pathogens simultaneously avoiding deleterious effects frank iron deficiency and/or iron deficiency anaemia. mechanism essentially immunological passive aggressive orchestrated man kind.
