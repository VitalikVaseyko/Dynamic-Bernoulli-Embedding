 Instead relying mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells rely heavily aerobic glycolysis, phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect". considered effect direct consequence damage persists cancer cells recover damage. end, studied glycolysis rate cell proliferation cancer cells recovered severe damage. show vitro Damage-Recovered (DR) cells exhibit mitochondrial structural remodeling, display Warburg effect, show increased vitro vivo proliferation tolerance damage. test whether cancer cells derived tumor microenvironment show similar properties, isolated Damage-Recovered (T(DR)) cells tumors. demonstrate T(DR) cells also show increased aerobic glycolysis high proliferation rate. findings show Warburg effect consequences induced cancer cells survive severe damage.
