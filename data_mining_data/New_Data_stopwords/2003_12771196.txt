 Double-stranded short interfering RNAs (siRNA) induce post-transcriptional silencing variety biological systems. present study investigated structural requirements chemically synthesised siRNAs mediate efficient gene silencing mammalian cells. contrast studies Drosophila extracts, found synthetic, double-stranded siRNAs without specific nucleotide overhangs highly efficient gene silencing. Blocking 5'-hydroxyl terminus antisense strand leads dramatic loss RNA interference activity, whereas blocking 3' terminus blocking termini sense strand negative effect. demonstrate synthetic siRNA molecules internal 2'-O-methyl modification, molecules terminal modifications, protected serum-derived nucleases. Finally, analysed different sets siRNA molecules various 2'-O-methyl modifications stability activity. demonstrate 2'-O-methyl modifications specific positions molecule improve stability siRNAs serum tolerated without significant loss RNA interference activity. second generation siRNAs better suited potential therapeutic application synthetic siRNAs vivo.
