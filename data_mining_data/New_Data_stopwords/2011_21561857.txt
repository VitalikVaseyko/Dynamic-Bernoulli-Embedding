 p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) regulated multiple phosphorylation events. Three sites highly conserved among AGC kinases (cAMP dependent Protein Kinase, cGMP dependent Protein Kinase, Protein Kinase C subfamily): activation loop kinase domain, two C-terminal sites, turn motif hydrophobic motif. common dogma phosphorylation hydrophobic motif primes S6K1 phosphorylation activation loop phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). Here, show turn motif is, fact, phosphorylated first, activation loop second, hydrophobic motif third. Specifically, biochemical analyses construct S6K1 lacking C-terminal autoinhibitory domain well full-length S6K1, reveals S6K1 constitutively phosphorylated turn motif expressed insect cells becomes phosphorylated vitro purified PDK1 activation loop. species phosphorylated activation loop PDK1 gets phosphorylated hydrophobic motif mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) vitro. data consistent previous model constitutive phosphorylation turn motif provides key priming step phosphorylation S6K1. data provide evidence regulation S6K1, hydrophobic motif phosphorylation required PDK1 phosphorylate S6K1 activation loop, instead activation loop phosphorylation S6K1 required mTOR phosphorylate hydrophobic motif S6K1.
