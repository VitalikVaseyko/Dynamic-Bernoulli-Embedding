 cDNA encoding complete rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase isozyme (RMPK) cloned using method rapid amplification cDNA ends. sequence encodes polypeptide chain 530 amino acids differs three amino acid residues sequence reported Larsen et al. (Larsen, T.M., Laughlin, T., Holden, H.M., Rayment, L, Reed, G.H. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6301-6309). Glu233-Gln234 Ala400 identified instead Asp233-Glu234 Ser400, respectively. recombinant RMPK overexpressed Escherichia coli JM 105 cells. Purified recombinant pyruvate kinase displayed identical physical enzymatic properties authentic enzyme. Three point mutants RMPK constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Like wild type RMPK, sedimentation, CD spectroscopic studies show purified RI 19C T340M tetrameric proteins similar secondary tertiary structures. Mutant R119C enzyme exhibits 0.6% value k(cat) order magnitude decrease apparent affinity ADP compared wild type PK. overall response inhibitor activator, Phe FBP, respectively, affected R119C mutation. T340M mutant enzyme half active wild type PK. T340M susceptible inhibition Phe apparently responsive activator FBP. kinetic behavior Q377K mutant enzyme R119C T340M mutants exhibiting 5% wild type enzymatic activity enhanced sensitivity inhibitor, Phe, maintaining responsiveness FBP apparent affinities substrates. significant decrease activity three mutants mimics exact consequences mutations human erythrocyte PK hemolytic anemia patients. Thus, study demonstrates effects conserved residues regulatory properties mammalian PK. also observed effects likely applicable isozymic forms PK.
