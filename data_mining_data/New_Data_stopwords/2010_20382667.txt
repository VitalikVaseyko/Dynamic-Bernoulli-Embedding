 role pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) insulin-stimulated glycogen replenishment day exercise, molecular control, examined. study investigated effect acute exercise basal insulin-stimulated PDC activity (the rate-limiting step glucose oxidation), glycogen synthesis expression metabolic genes transcription factors associated changes PDC activation glucose metabolism. Eight healthy men (age 24 +/- 2 years, body mass 79 +/- 4 kg) underwent euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp 22 h 90 min one-legged cycling 60% maximal oxygen consumption. Skeletal muscle glycogen content similar exercised (EX) non-exercised leg (CON) preclamp (471 +/- 30 versus 463 +/- 50 mmol (kg dry matter)(1), respectively) increased clamp EX 527 +/- 20 mmol (kg dry matter)(1), 17% greater CON (449 +/- 35 mmol (kg dry matter)(1), P < 0.05). increase insulin-mediated glycogen storage independent insulin-stimulated Akt serine(473) phosphorylation activation PDC. Prior exercise modulate mRNA expression protein content pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) skeletal muscle, associated increased hexokinase II mRNA expression protein content upregulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) PPARdelta gene expression. Collectively, findings suggest prior exercise alter basal insulin-stimulated PDC activation protein content PDK4 following day, associated increased capacity (through upregulation hexokinase II content) muscle phosphorylate divert glucose towards glycogen storage.
