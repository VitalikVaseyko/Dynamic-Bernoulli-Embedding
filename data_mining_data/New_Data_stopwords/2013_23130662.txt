 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) nuclear receptor plays important roles breast cancer cell proliferation. complexity underlying biochemical molecular mechanisms breast cancer involvement PPARgamma breast cancer pathophysiology unclear. study, carried prediction peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) motifs 2332 genes reported involved breast cancer literature. total 178 genes found PPRE (DR1/DR2) and/or PPAR-associated conserved motif (PACM) motifs. constructed protein-protein interaction network, disease gene network gene ontology (GO) analyses identify novel key genes experimental validation. identified two genes glycolytic pathway (phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)) ATP production steps experimentally validated repression PPARgamma two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 MCF-7. analysis suggested repression leads decrease ATP levels apoptosis. investigations help us understanding molecular mechanisms PPARgamma regulates cellular energy pathway use ligands human breast cancer therapeutics.
