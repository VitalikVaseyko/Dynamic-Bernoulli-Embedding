 effects site-specific analogs adenosine cAMP content pyruvate kinase activity isolated rat hepatocytes studied. N6-(phenylisopropyl) adenosine (PIA), metabolically stable analog adenosine acts specifically 'R' sites, increased cAMP content decreased pyruvate kinase activity extent epinephrine, contrast, adenosine without effect. Consistent 'R'-site mediated effects, effects PIA blocked 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine. 2'5'-Dideoxyadenosine, acts specifically 'p' sites inhibit adenylate cyclase, counteracted effects epinephrine pyruvate kinase, paradoxically effects PIA. adenylate cyclase membranes parenchymal cells determined found exhibit comparable sensitivity 'R' site-specific analogs activators enzyme prepared whole liver. Thus, data suggest effects liver metabolism 'R' site-specific analogs adenosine initiated adenosine-receptor coupled activation adenylate cyclase effects characteristics parenchymal cells.
