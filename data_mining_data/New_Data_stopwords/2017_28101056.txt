 gluconeogenesis pathway, known normally present liver, kidney, intestine, muscle, four irreversible steps catalyzed enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, glucose 6-phosphatase. Studies also demonstrated evidence gluconeogenesis exists brain astrocytes convincing data yet found neurons. Astrocytes exhibit significant 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 activity, key mechanism regulating glycolysis gluconeogenesis. Astrocytes unique use glycolysis produce lactate, shuttled neurons used gluconeogenic precursors reduction. gluconeogenesis pathway found astrocytes becoming recognized important alternative glucose source neurons, specifically ischemic stroke brain tumor. studies needed discover gluconeogenesis pathway controlled brain, may lead development therapeutic targets control energy levels cellular survival ischemic stroke patients, inhibit gluconeogenesis brain tumors promote malignant cell death tumor regression. extensive studies mechanisms cerebral glycolysis ischemic stroke brain tumors, studies cerebral gluconeogenesis limited. Here, review studies done date regarding gluconeogenesis evaluate whether metabolic pathway beneficial detrimental brain pathological conditions.
