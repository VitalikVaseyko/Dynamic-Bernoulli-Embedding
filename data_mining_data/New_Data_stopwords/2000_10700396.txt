 Oral administration lithium carbonate fed-healthy rats strongly decreased liver glycogen content, despite simultaneous activation glycogen synthase inactivation glycogen phosphorylase. effect seemed related decrease glucose 6-phosphate concentration decrease glucokinase activity. Moreover, animals lithium markedly decreased liver fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, could consequence fall glucose 6-phosphate inactivation 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. Liver pyruvate kinase activity blood insulin also decreased lithium administration. Lower doses lithium carbonate less intense effects. Lithium administration starved-healthy fed-streptozotocin-diabetic rats caused slight increase blood insulin, simultaneous increases liver glycogen, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 2, 6-phosphate. Glucokinase, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, pyruvate kinase activities also increased lithium administration starved-healthy fed-diabetic rats. Lithium treatment activated glycogen synthase inactivated glycogen phosphorylase manner similar observed fed-healthy rats. Glycemia modified group animals. results indicate lithium acts liver glycogen metabolism vivo least two different ways: one related changes insulinemia, related direct action lithium activity key enzymes liver glucose metabolism.
