 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase pyruvate kinase Candida utilis baker's yeast, anionic form, adsorbed cation exchanger, P-cellulose, due affinities similar phosphoric groups respective substrates; thus, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase readily eluted either NADP+ NADPH, glutathione reductase NADPH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate, pyruvate kinase either ATP ADP. type chromatography may called "affinity-adsorption-elution chromatography"; main principle different so-called affinity-elution chromatography. Based findings, large-scale procedure suitable successive purification several enzymes affinities phosphoric groups substrates devised. example, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase highly purified baker's yeast crystallized.
