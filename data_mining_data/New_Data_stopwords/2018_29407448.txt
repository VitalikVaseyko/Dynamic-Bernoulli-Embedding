 Nongenomic actions thyroid hormone initiated hormone receptors plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria require interaction nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) primary ligand, 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3). Receptors involved nongenomic actions may may structural homologies TRs. Certain nongenomic actions originate plasma membrane may modify state function intranuclear TRs. Reviewed nongenomic effects hormone-T3 or, cases, l-thyroxine (T4)-that initiated (a) truncated TRalpha isoforms, e.g., p30 TRalpha1, (b) cytoplasmic proteins, (c) plasma membrane integrin alphavbeta3. p30 TRalpha1 transcriptionally competent, binds T3 cell surface, consequently expresses number important functions bone cells. Nongenomic hormonal control mitochondrial respiration involves TRalpha isoform, another truncated TRalpha isoform nongenomically regulates state cellular actin. Cytoplasmic hormone-binding proteins involved nongenomic actions thyroid hormone include ketimine reductase, pyruvate kinase, TRbeta shuttle among intracellular compartments. Functions receptor T4 integrin alphavbeta3 include stimulation proliferation cancer endothelial cells (angiogenesis) regulation transcription cancer cell survival pathway genes. T4 serves prohormone T3 genomic actions thyroid hormone, T4 hormone alphavbeta3 important cancer cell function T3. Thus, characterization nongenomic actions hormone served broaden understanding cellular roles T3 T4.
