 study aims demonstrate effect high glucose concentrations NHE-1 PK activities investigate implicated signal transduction pathways. Erythrocytes drawn healthy volunteers incubated presence 5 50 mM glucose, fructose, galactose mannitol. appropriate, specific inhibitors NHE-1, PKC p42/44 MAPK used. Erythrocyte NHE-1 activity estimated fluorometrical determination intracellular pH quantification sodium uptake using 22Na. Pyruvate kinase activity measured NADH-lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic assay. p42/44 MAPK activity assessed specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased concentrations glucose galactose, fructose mannitol enhanced erythrocyte NHE-1, PK p42/44 MAPK activity. Inhibition PKC, counteracted effects glucose. Similarly, inhibition NHE 1 abolished effect high glucose PK p42/44 MAPK well. Finally, inhibition p42/44 MAPK also hindered effect glucose NHE-1 PK activities. data present study indicate acute effect glucose signal transduction pathways human erythrocytes. pathway involves NHE-1, PKC, p42/44 MAPK. positive feedback NHE 1 p42/44 MAPK suggested.
