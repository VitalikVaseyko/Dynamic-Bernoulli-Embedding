 Rabbit aorta predominantly synthesizes prostacyclin (PGI2), potent inhibitor platelet aggregation strong vasodilator. report effect vitamin E depletion repletion endogenous release PGI2 rabbit aorta. Serum pyruvate kinase monitored myopathy. endogenous release PGI2 aorta, detected stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, inhibited indomethacin inversely related size aorta sections. Deficient aorta synthesized significantly less PGI2 control animals. Repletion deficient animals 48 h completely restored PGI2 release level comparable control values. data showed PGI2 synthesis aorta influenced dietary vitamin E.
