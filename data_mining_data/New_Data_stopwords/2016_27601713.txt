 Recent genomic studies shed light impact vitro culture (IVC) embryonic homeostasis differential gene expression profiles associated lower developmental competence. Consistently, embryonic stress responses IVC conditions correlate transcriptomic changes pathways related energetic metabolism, extracellular matrix remodelling inflammatory signalling. changes appear result developmental adaptation enhances Warburg-like effect known occur naturally blastulation. First discovered cancer cells, Warburg effect (increased glycolysis aerobic conditions) thought result mitochondrial dysfunction. case IVC embryos, culture conditions may interfere mitochondrial maturation oxidative phosphorylation, forcing cells rely glycolysis order maintain energetic homeostasis. beneficial short term, adaptations may lead epigenetic changes potential long-term effects implantation, foetal growth post-natal health. conclude lessening detrimental effects IVC mitochondrial activity would lead significantly improved embryo quality.
