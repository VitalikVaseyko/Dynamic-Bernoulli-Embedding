 BACKGROUND: Circulatory arrest (CA), provides bloodless field good visualization without need aortic cross-clamp, commonly used facilitate repair aortic lesions. However, extended periods CA may impair cerebral metabolism cause ischemic injury. Studies performed evaluate efficacy retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) protecting brain ischemic injury prolonged period CA moderate hypothermia. METHODS RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (18 men 5 women) operated aortic lesions (17 acute type aortic dissection 6 chronic type aortic dissection Marfan's syndrome). aortic operations performed CA (58 104 minutes; mean +/- SD, 75 +/- 12 minutes) rectal temperature 23.3 +/- 0.5 degrees C (21 degrees C 25 degrees C). RCP, cold (14 degrees C 18 degrees C) oxygenated blood (300 mL/min) pumped superior vena cava internal jugular venous pressure 15 +/- 5 mm Hg. cardiopulmonary bypass time 157 +/- 18 minutes. Cortical blood flow RCP detected subdural laser Doppler probe 10 +/- 5% baseline. Percent oxygen extraction pyruvate lactate levels (26 +/- 2% 0.43 +/- 0.17 45 +/- 16 mg/dI) insignificantly different CA (28 +/- 3% 0.71 +/- 0.08 62 +/- 20 mg/dL, P > .05). Creatine kinase-BB isoenzyme undetectable. 1 patient survived operation (95.5%) woke without neurological deficit. Follow-up (mean, 13 months) complete survivors. late deaths. Cerebral functional studies performed 3 months discharge showed results insignificantly different normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: evidence ischemia brain prolonged moderate hypothermic CA aid RCP. Retrograde cerebral perfusion effectively extends safe time CA. Deep hypothermia CA seems unnecessary.
