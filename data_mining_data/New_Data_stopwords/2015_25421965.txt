 Prolyl hydroxylation PTM plays important role formation collagen fibrils oxygen-dependent regulation hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). modification well characterized context proteins, remains unclear extent occurs remaining mammalian proteome. explored question using MS analyze cellular extracts subjected various fractionation strategies. one strategy, employed von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein, recognizes prolyl hydroxylated HIF-alpha, scaffold generating hydroxyproline capture reagents. report novel sites prolyl hydroxylation within five proteins: FK506-binding protein 10, myosin heavy chain 10, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase, C-1 Tetrahydrofolate synthase. Furthermore, show identification prolyl hydroxylation presents significant technical challenge owing widespread isobaric methionine oxidation, manual inspection spectra modified peptides context critical validation.
