 Cancer cells prefer anaerobic ATP synthesis, regardless availability oxygen. hypothesized cells, glycolytic enzymes associate large complex, results increased efficiency glycolytic flux. However, convincing vivo evidence supporting hypothesis. Here, show enzymes triose phosphate metabolism, aldolase pyruvate kinase consecutively, form macromolecular complex vivo disruption complex significantly inhibits lactate release ATP synthesis glycolytic pathway. Composition complex effectiveness glycolytic flux depends lactate glucose concentration. High concentrations exogenous lactate reduces association C-terminal region phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) complex results disruption inhibition ATP synthesis. Additionally, high lactate affects nuclear localization PGAM ceases cell proliferation. findings might provide new prospects cancer treatment using low-molecular weight competitors destabilize glycolytic complex reduce proliferative potential cancer cells.
