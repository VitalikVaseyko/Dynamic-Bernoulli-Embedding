 Colorectal cancer (CRC) one frequently occurring cancers high morbidity mortality worldwide. Amphiregulin (AREG), member epidermal growth factor family rational target CRC therapy, essential three-dimensional structure tumor formation. clone genes associated increased AREG expression, performed cDNA microarray analysis two CRC cell lines undergoing two-dimensional (2DC) three-dimensional culture (3DC). Upregulated (>2.0-fold) downregulated (<0.5-fold) genes 3DC compared 2DC selected. Pathway analysis using DAVID based Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases revealed number genes involved glycolysis. CRC cells, glucose elevated expression GLUT1 AREG well activity hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) luciferase reporter promoter. suppression AREG expression reduced uptake glucose production lactate. Luciferase assay identified critical regulatory region AREG expression -130 -180 bp upstream start site, contained carbohydrate response element (ChoRE). Max-like protein X (MLX) bound ChoRE enhanced expression AREG. Together data suggest AREG plays pivotal role development CRC activation Warburg effect.
