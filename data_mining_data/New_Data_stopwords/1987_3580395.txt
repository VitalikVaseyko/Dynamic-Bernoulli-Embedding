 mathematical model circadian self-oscillation carbohydrate branch energy metabolism (CEM) analysed. self-oscillations due reciprocal regulation activities 6-phosphofructokinase fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. circadian period shown insensitive metabolic disturbances presence CEM negative feedback mechanisms regulating activities key enzymes 6-phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. also shown mechanisms largely synergistic action.
