 Oxygen consumption (QO2), respiratory quotient (RQ) gluconeogenesis rat kidney cortex slices determined (Warburg technique). QO2 influenced 0.01 mM CdCl2 incubation medium (no exogenous substrate added), 0.1 mM, 1mM 10 mM, respectively, reduced QO2 43%, 45% 68%. presence 8 mM glucose, 10 mM acetate 5 mM butyrate, 1 mM Cd resulted decrease QO2 50% each. Addition 20 g/l albumine medium abolished effect cadmium. RQ influenced mM Cd, without 8 mM glucose medium. Glucose production 7 mM pyruvate 5 mM glutaminate slices fed starving rats reduced 1 mM Cd half value found controls.
