 Acupuncture exhibited therapeutic effects vascular dementia previous research. mechanism anti-dementia effects involves energy metabolism. brain cells, glucose metabolism almost source energy, glucose metabolism disorders early signs dementia. addition, glucose metabolism associates closely glycometabolic enzymes, thereby maintains normal energy supply brains neurological mental activities. order investigate anti-dementia mechanism, studied effects acupuncture behavior multi-infarct dementia (MID) rats glycometabolic enzymes protein expression activities brains. Results showed acupuncture improved cognitive disorder, increased activities hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Accordingly, suggests anti-dementia effects acupuncture may mediated regulation hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activities, influencing energy metabolic system thus overcoming dysfunctional cognition MID.
