 BACKGROUND: unique metabolism tumors described many years ago Otto Warburg, identified tumor cells increased glycolysis decreased mitochondrial activity. However, "aerobic glycolysis" generates fewer ATP per glucose molecule mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, terms energy production, unclear increasing less efficient process provides tumors growth advantage. METHODS/FINDINGS: carried screen loss genetic elements pancreatic tumor cells accelerated growth tumors, identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown MRPL28 cells decreased mitochondrial activity, increased glycolysis, paradoxically, decreased cellular growth vitro. Following Warburg's observations, mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase glycolysis accelerated growth vivo. Likewise, knockdown either mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) cytochrome oxidase similar effect. Conversely, expression mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen consumption decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment tumor bearing animals dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia slowed tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: interpret findings show non-oncogenic genetic changes alter mitochondrial metabolism regulate tumor growth modulation consumption oxygen, appears rate limiting substrate tumor proliferation.
