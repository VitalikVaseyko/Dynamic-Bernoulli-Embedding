 OBJECTIVES: performance 2 tumor markers carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (Tu-M2-PK) separately combination detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) evaluated prospective study. METHODS: study comprised 103 patients referred suspicion pancreatic cancer. these, 51 patients conditions diagnosed PDAC, whereas diagnosis ruled 52 12 months follow-up. performance Tu-M2-PK compared CA19-9 using cutoff values 15 37 U/mL, respectively. RESULTS: sensitivity Tu-M2-PK CA19-9 detecting PDAC 55% 86% specificities 52% 73%, respectively. area curve (AUC) Tu-M2-PK 0.55 CA19-9 0.84. Combining 2 markers significantly improve AUC (AUC = 0.85, P = 0.72) compared CA19-9 used alone. presence chronic pancreatitis jaundice causes increased levels CA19-9 influence Tu-M2-PK. CONCLUSIONS: Tu-M2-PK inferior CA19-9 marker PDAC. Tu-M2-PK may role diagnosing PDAC affected cholestasis Lewis phenotype. Neither tumor marker stand alone diagnosis PDAC.
