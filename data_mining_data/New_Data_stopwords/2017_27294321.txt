 Metabolic enzymes specific. However, show weak side activities toward compounds structurally related physiological substrates, thereby producing side products may toxic. cases, 'metabolite repair enzymes' eliminating side products identified. show mammalian glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase, two core glycolytic enzymes, produce 4-phosphoerythronate 2-phospho-L-lactate, respectively. 4-Phosphoerythronate strongly inhibits enzyme pentose phosphate pathway, whereas 2-phospho-L-lactate inhibits enzyme producing glycolytic activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. discovered single, widely conserved enzyme, known phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) mammals, dephosphorylates 4-phosphoerythronate 2-phospho-L-lactate, thereby preventing block pentose phosphate pathway glycolysis. yeast ortholog, Pho13, similarly dephosphorylates 4-phosphoerythronate 2-phosphoglycolate, side product pyruvate kinase. work illustrates metabolite repair enzymes make limited specificity metabolic enzymes permit high flux central metabolic pathways.
