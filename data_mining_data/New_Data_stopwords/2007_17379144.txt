 Coenzyme (CoA) major acyl group carrier intermediary metabolism. Hopantenate (HoPan), competitive inhibitor pantothenate kinases, used chemically antagonize CoA biosynthesis. HoPan dramatically reduced liver CoA mice developed severe hypoglycemia. Insulin reduced, glucagon corticosterone elevated, fasting accelerated hypoglycemia. Metabolic profiling revealed large increase acylcarnitines, illustrating role carnitine buffering acyl groups maintain nonesterified CoASH level. HoPan triggered significant changes hepatic gene expression substantially increased thioesterases, liberate CoASH acyl-CoA, increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, prevents conversion CoASH acetyl-CoA. results identify metabolic rearrangements maintain CoASH pool critical mitochondrial functions, including gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid urea cycles.
