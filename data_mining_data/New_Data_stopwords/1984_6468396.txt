 red muscle pyruvate kinase anoxic Busycotypus canaliculatum (PK-anoxic) phosphoprotein demonstrated anoxia-dependent, vivo, covalent incorporation injected [32P]orthophosphate enzyme molecule. Specificity labelling PK-anoxic strongly suggested by: (a) coincidental elution pyruvate kinase activity radioactivity following chromatography purified PK-anoxic Sepharose CL-6B, (b) comigration area containing [32P]phosphate Coomassie-Blue-staining protein following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis homogenous PK-anoxic. [32P]phosphate content enzyme calculated 7.3 mol phosphate/mol enzyme (233 kDa, 180 units/mg protein). Evidence reversibility phosphorylation provided consistent kinetic similarities purified red muscle pyruvate kinase aerobic animals (PK-aerobic) homogenous, unlabelled, alkaline phosphatase treated PK-anoxic. Comparison electrophoretic mobilities products derived acid hydrolysis purified 32P-labelled PK-anoxic authentic substances suggest presence O-phospho-L-threonine residue protein. residue plays probable role interconversion mechanism suggested lack phosphate exchange homogenous 32P-labelled PK-anoxic presence substrates. possible role protein phosphorylation mechanism overall control molluscan anaerobic metabolism suggested.
