 BACKGROUND: paper propose chemical physics mechanism initiation glycolytic switch commonly known Warburg hypothesis, whereby glycolytic activity terminating lactate continues even well-oxygenated cells. show may result cancer via mitotic failure, recasting current conception Warburg effect metabolic dysregulation consequent cancer, biophysical defect may contribute cancer initiation. MODEL: model based analogs thermodynamic concepts tie non-equilibrium fluid dynamics ultimately metabolic imbalance, disrupted microtubule dynamics, finally, genomic instability, cancers arise. Specifically, discuss analog non-equilibrium Rayleigh-Benard convection result glycolytic oscillations cause cell become locked higher-entropy state characteristic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: quantitative model presented attributes well-known Warburg effect biophysical mechanism driven convective disturbance cell. Contrary current understanding, effect may precipitate cancer development, rather follow it, providing new insights carcinogenesis, cancer treatment, prevention.
