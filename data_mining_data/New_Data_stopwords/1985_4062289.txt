 oxidative decarboxylation subsequent production glucose alpha-ketobutyrate studied using perfused livers fasted rats. production 14CO2 alpha-keto-[1-14C]butyrate increased monotonically production glucose alpha-ketobutyrate biphasic perfusate concentration alpha-ketobutyrate increased. biphasic gluconeogenic response using alpha-ketobutyrate gluconeogenic precursor similar observed propionate. decarboxylation alpha-ketobutyrate found exquisitely sensitive effects monocarboxylate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanocinnamate. Infusion beta-hydroxybutyrate caused substantial inhibition alpha-ketobutyrate decarboxylation dichloroacetate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, stimulate metabolism alpha-ketobutyrate inhibitory. effects alpha-ketobutyrate infusion pyruvate decarboxylation tested found low perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 0.25 mM) increasing alpha-ketobutyrate led increasing inhibition pyruvate decarboxylation, high perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 2.5 mM) initial inhibition apparent increase substantially increasing alpha-ketobutyrate concentrations. results obtained indicate regulation alpha-ketobutyrate metabolism oxidative decarboxylation differs significantly pyruvate. addition, rate gluconeogenesis using alpha-ketobutyrate precursor remarkably similar using propionate gluconeogenic precursor, effects alpha-ketobutyrate oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate qualitatively different effects propionate pyruvate metabolism.
