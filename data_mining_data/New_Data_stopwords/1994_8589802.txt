 dependence erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK)-catalyzed reaction glycolytic intermediates glucose-6-phosphate (Gluc-6-P), 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) nucleotides ADP ATP studied normal individuals 14 patients PK deficiency. Gluc-6-P concentrations erythrocytes markedly elevated (4- 6-fold) 9 patients severe hemolytic anemia compared 5 exhibiting mild clinical course (up 2-fold increased). 2,3-DPG elevated 2 times compared controls whereas measured ADP ATP slightly deviate normal range. Control experiments showed elevations Gluc-6-P 2,3-DPG depend number reticulocytes. enzyme kinetic terms, Gluc-6-P shifts Hill coefficient smaller values, i.e. suppresses positive cooperativity (sigmoidal reaction kinetics), found normal mutant enzymes shift noncooperative enzymes patients enzyme exhibiting negative cooperativity. negative cooperativity already present enzymes patients suffering severe hemolytic anemia becomes pronounced upon addition Gluc-6-P. Apparently 2,3-DPG acts antagonist Gluc-6-P increasing Hill coefficient, i.e. enhancing positive cooperativity normal enzyme. shifts hyperbolic patients' enzymes sigmoidal reaction type enzymes patients negative cooperativity hyperbolic type. ADP ATP show similar behavior 2,3-DPG, additionally inhibit enzyme higher concentrations. influence four phosphates Michaelis constant varies depending type cooperativity, cases increasing cases decreasing K0.5 PEP. 7 patients, severe clinical course, genetic analysis R-type PK gene performed genetic defects identified coding sequence. found changes amino acid sequence corresponding location tertiary structure PK subunit satisfactorily explain alterations regulatory properties mutant enzymes thus allowing establish good correlation altered structural functional properties deficient enzyme severeness course disease.
