 ornithine decarboxylase-inducing factor (ODC factor) purified 1,000-fold 42% yield ascites fluids Ehrlich ascites tumor combination centrifugation concanavalin (ConA) treatment. single ip injection 0.5 micrograms purified factor per mouse resulted half-maximum induction liver ODC. factor found trypsin- chymotrypsin-resistant, acidic glycoprotein (pI 4.43) minimum molecular weight 70 kilodaltons, containing disulfide bond(s) functional domain. react ConA. factor induced retrodifferentiation liver function, causing marked increase prototype M2 isozyme pyruvate kinase. reduced liver catalase activity, also modified thyroid hormone metabolism, reducing serum levels T4 T3. results suggest ODC factor multifunctional induces many changes observed tumor-bearing host.
