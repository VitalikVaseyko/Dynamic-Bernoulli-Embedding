 Increasing evidence suggests important role metabolic reprogramming regulation innate inflammatory response, underlying mechanism remains unclear. provide evidence support novel role pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-mediated Warburg effect, namely aerobic glycolysis, regulation high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release. PKM2 interacts hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) activates HIF-1alpha-dependent transcription enzymes necessary aerobic glycolysis macrophages. Knockdown PKM2, HIF1alpha glycolysis-related genes uniformly decreases lactate production HMGB1 release. Similarly, potential PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin, reduces serum lactate HMGB1 levels, protects mice lethal endotoxemia sepsis. Collectively, findings shed light novel mechanism metabolic control inflammation regulating HMGB1 release highlight importance targeting aerobic glycolysis treatment sepsis inflammatory diseases.
