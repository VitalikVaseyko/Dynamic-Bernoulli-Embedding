 Rainbow trout limited ability utilize digestible carbohydrates efficiently. Trout feeds generally contain high levels DHA, fatty acid known inhibit number glycolytic lipogenic enzymes animals. study conducted determine whether carbohydrate utilization rainbow trout might affected dietary DHA level. Two low-carbohydrate (<4 % digestible carbohydrate) basal diets formulated contain 1 (adequate) 4 (excess) g/100 g DHA diet respectively. two basal diets diluted increasing levels digestible starch (0 %, 10 %, 20 % 30 %, respectively) produce eight diets. diets fed fish 12 weeks 15 degrees C according pair-fed protocol consisted feeding amount basal diet different amounts starch. Live weight, N lipid gains, hepatic glycogen plasma glucose values significantly increased, whereas feed efficiency (gain:feed) significantly decreased, increasing starch intake (P<0.05). retention efficiency N (N gain/digestible N intake) improved starch supplementation affected DHA level (P>0.05). Starch increased activity glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase fatty acid synthase (P<0.05) affect hexokinase malic enzyme activity. DHA effect growth increased plasma glucose reduced carcass lipid liver glycogen contents (P<0.05). Glycolytic lipogenic enzymes affected DHA level, except pyruvate kinase, reduced increasing DHA level. results suggest marginal effect dietary DHA ability fish utilize carbohydrate.
