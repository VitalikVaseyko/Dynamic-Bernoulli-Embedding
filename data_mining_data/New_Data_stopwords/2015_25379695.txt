 p-Synephrine, primary protoalkaloid extract bitter orange citrus species, gained interest due lipolytic activity adipose tissues. previously found p-synephrine stimulates glucose consumption via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) L6 skeletal muscle cells. study investigated effect p-synephrine glucose production lipid accumulation H4IIE rat liver cells. Glucose production increased H4llE cells incubated glucose-free medium decreased dose dependently (1-100 muM) p-synephrine treatment. Protein levels glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) also decreased treatment (4 h) p-synephrine. Antagonists alpha- beta-adrenergic receptors (phentolamine propranolol) inhibitors signaling molecules interrupt p-synephrine-induced suppression glucose production. However, H7 (an inhibitor serine/threonine kinases PKA, PKC, PKG) significantly blocked p-synephrine-induced suppression glucose production increased basal glucose production. Unlike suppressive effect glucose production, p-synephrine failed affect palmitic acid-induced cytoplasmic lipid accumulation. Protein levels fatty acid synthase (FAS) phosphorylation levels AMPK ACC changed p-synephrine. Altogether, p-synephrine suppress glucose production affect lipid accumulation H4IIE liver cells.
