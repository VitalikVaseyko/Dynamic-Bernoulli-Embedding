 Diamondback terrapins experience broad fluctuations temperature daily seasonal basis estuarine environment. measured metabolic enzyme activity terrapin muscle tissue assess thermal dependence role temperature seasonal metabolic downregulation species. Activity lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) assayed 10, 20, 30, 40 degrees C tissue collected summer winter. Q(10) enzyme activity varied 1.31 2.11 within temperature range terrapins active (20-40 degrees C). Q(10) LDH, CS, CCO varied 1.39 1.76 10 20 degrees C, PK exhibited heightened thermal sensitivity within lower temperature range, Q(10) 2.90 summer-collected tissue 5.55 winter-collected tissue. significant effect season activity LDH PK, activity CS CCO significantly lower winter-collected tissue compared summer-collected tissue. Results indicate temperature effects contribute seasonal metabolic downregulation dormancy terrapins, environmental factors (i.e. oxygen availability), well seasonal shifts blood biochemistry circulating hormones may also play important role.
