 studied subcellular distribution phosphoproteins intact hippocampal slices examined factors regulate phosphorylation dephosphorylation situ. presence Ca2+ slice equilibration prelabeling buffers high-K+-induced depolarization markedly increased 32Pi incorporation endogenous proteins. Ca2+-stimulatory effects significantly reduced Ca2+-channel blockers calmodulin antagonist W-13. Certain proteins dephosphorylated situ, dephosphorylation dependent Ca2+ depolarization. number proteins phosphorylated situ similar previously characterized synaptic fractions phosphorylated vitro. Many phosphoproteins identified basis molecular weight, isoelectric point, immunoreactivity, phosphopeptide mapping; included 87 kDa substrate protein kinase C, synapsin I, 50 60 kDa subunits Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CKII), tubulin, B-50, alpha-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase myelin basic proteins. CKII phosphorylation situ appeared similar identical vitro counterpart. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis situ labeled substrate proteins indicated cAMP-, Ca2+/calmodulin-, Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases active slice preparations basal conditions. Increased 32Pi labeling hippocampal proteins following tissue depolarization appeared associated increased activity endogenous protein kinases since depolarization result 32Pi-labeling new phosphoproteins.
