 80 years ago, Warburg identified particular metabolic pathway carcinomas characterised anaerobic degradation glucose even presence oxygen leads production large amounts lactate (known Warburg effect). Now, widespread clinical use positron-emission tomography (PET) confirmed exists enhanced glucose degradation tumors. Recent research demonstrated pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) augmented tumors, especially non-oxidative part PPP. non-oxidative part PPP controlled transketolase enzyme reactions. present study designed evaluate effect transketolase activity nasopharyngeal carcinoma. found transketolase activity significantly stronger human nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues human chronic nasopharyngitis tissues. strong upregulation transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1) human nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues cell line (CNE), whereas transketolase (TKT) transketolase-like-2 (TKTL2) upregulated. inhibited expression (TKTL1) RNAi, found total transketolase activity dramatically downregulated proliferation cancer cells significantly inhibited CNE cells. results indicate TKTL1 gene influences total transketolase activity cell proliferation human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, suggesting TKTL1 gene plays important role glycometabolism tumors might become novel target tumor gene therapy.
