 Solid tumors contend with, adapt to, hostile micro-environment includes limited availability nutrient fuels oxygen. presence hypoxia (O2 <5%) stabilizes transcription factor Hif1 results numerous cellular adaptations including increased flux glucose glycolysis. Increasingly, sophisticated analysis tumor oxygenation revealed large gradients oxygen tension significant regions severe hypoxia (O2 approximately 0.1%). present investigation demonstrated significant increase glycolytic flux rate tumor spheroids exposed 0.1% O2 . severe hypoxia associated uniform pimonidazole adduct formation elevated levels Hif1alpha c-Myc. resulted elevated expression GLUT MCT transporters, addition increased activity PFK1 comparison observed normoxia. However, protein expression enzymatic capacity HK2, G6PDH, PK, LDH reduced severe hypoxia. Clearly, effects exposure severe hypoxia lead significantly abridged Hif1 response, yet one still able elevate glycolytic flux prevent loss intermediates anabolism. J. Cell.
