 Clinical use doxorubicin (DOX) cancer therapy limited dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. molecular mechanisms underlying phenomenon well defined. study investigate effect DOX changes global genomics hearts. Acute cardiotoxicity induced giving C57BL/6J mice single intraperitoneal injection DOX (15 mg/kg). Cardiac function apoptosis monitored using echocardiography TUNEL assay days 1, 3 5. Myocardial glucose ATP levels measured. Microarray assays used screen gene expression profiles hearts day 5, results confirmed qPCR analysis. DOX administration caused decreased cardiac function, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis decreased glucose ATP levels. Microarrays showed 747 up-regulated genes 438 down-regulated genes involved seven main functional categories. Among them, metabolic pathway affected DOX. Several key genes, including 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase (Bpgm), hexokinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4 fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase, closely related glucose metabolism. Gene co-expression networks suggested core role Bpgm DOX cardiomyopathy. results obtained mice confirmed cultured cardiomyocytes. conclusion, genes involved glucose metabolism, especially Bpgm, may play central role pathogenesis DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
