 Theca cell-selective Pten mutation (tPtenMT) mice resulted increases PDK1 Akt phosphorylation, indicating over-activation PI3K signaling ovaries. mice displayed elevated androgen levels, ovary enlargement, antral follicle accumulation, early fertility loss increased expression Lhcgr genes crucial androgenesis. abnormalities partially reversed treatments PI3K Akt inhibitor. LH actions Pten deficient theca cells potentiated. phosphorylation Foxo1 increased, binding Foxo1 forkhead response elements Lhcgr promoter reduced tPtenMT theca cells, implying mechanism PI3K/Akt-induced upregulation Lhcgr theca cells might mediated reducing inhibitory effect Foxo1 Lhcgr promoter. phenotype tPtenMT females reminiscent human PCOS suggests dysregulated PI3K cascade theca cells may involved certain types PCOS pathogenesis.
