 Sulfoenolpyruvate, analogue phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate ester replaced sulfate ester, synthesized three chemical steps ethyl bromopyruvate 40% overall yield. compound substrate pyruvate kinase, producing pyruvate adenosine 5'-sulfatopyrophosphate. latter compound identified NMR spectroscopy comparison authentic sample. Sulfuryl transfer sulfoenolpyruvate 250-600-fold slower phosphate transfer phosphoenolpyruvate identical conditions. Sulfoenolpyruvate substrate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Kinetic studies reveal bind active site; instead, binds site normally occupied glucose 6-phosphate activates enzyme manner similar shown glucose 6-phosphate.
