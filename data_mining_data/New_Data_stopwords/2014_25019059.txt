 Newly emerging data highlight obesity important risk factor developing certain types cancer, including colorectal cancer. Although evidence supports link two, mechanisms responsible relationship yet fully elucidated. Hypertrophied dysfunctional adipose tissue obese state characterized low-grade inflammation. Adipokines cytokines secreted adipocytes, together abundant availability lipids adipocytes tumor microenvironment, promote adhesion, migration, invasion tumor cells support tumor progression uncontrolled growth. One predisposed targets deleterious effects exerted secretions adipose tissue obesity activities associated cellular mitochondria. Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism plays key role meeting cells' energetic demands oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). discuss: (a) dynamic relationship glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, OxPhos; (b) evidence impaired OxPhos (i.e., mitochondrial dysfunction) colon cancer; (c) mechanisms mitochondrial dysfunction predispose cancer. propose impaired OxPhos increases susceptibility colon cancer since OxPhos sensitive large number factors intrinsic host (e.g., inflammation). Given adipocytes major source adipokines energy cancer cell, understanding mechanisms metabolic symbiosis cancer cells adipocytes reveal new therapeutic possibilities.
