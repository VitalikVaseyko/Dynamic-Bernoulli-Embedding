 Cell-free extracts Bacillus licheniformis found contain pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes reaction pyruvate bicarbonate yield oxalacetate presence adenosine triphosphate (ATP), acetylcoenzyme (CoA), manganese. plot reaction velocity carboxylation partially purified pyruvate carboxylase (25-fold) concentration pyruvate, bicarbonate, manganese, ATP indicate pronounced deviation Michaelis-Menten hyperbola. enzyme inhibited avidin aspartate. Biotin partially protected enzyme avidin inhibition, whereas amount inhibition aspartate dependent concentration acetyl-CoA present. intracellular concentration acetyl-CoA vary significantly enough allow control enzyme method. Extracts 4-hr postexponential-phase cells B. licheniformis also found contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, appears catabolite repression control. suggested endogenous induction enzyme determining factor allowing shift gluconeogenesis glycolysis sporulation glucose-grown cells.
