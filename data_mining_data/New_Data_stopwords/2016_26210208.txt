 comparative molecular dynamics analysis pyruvate kinase Leishmania mexicana presented absence presence allosteric effector fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Comparisons simulations large 240 kDa apo holo tetramers show binding fructose 2,6-bisphosphate cools enzyme reduces dynamic movement, particularly B-domain. reduced dynamic movement holo form traps pyruvate kinase tetramer enzymatically active state B-domain acting lid cover active site. simulations also consistent transition mobile active-site alpha6' helix, would adopt helical conformation active R-state less structured coil conformation inactive T-state. Analysis rigid body motions trajectory highlights concerted anticorrelated rigid body rocking motion four protomers, drives R transition. transitions predicted simulations largely consistent Monod-Wyman-Changeux model allosteric activation also suggest rigidification cooling overall structure upon effector binding plays additional role enzyme activation.
