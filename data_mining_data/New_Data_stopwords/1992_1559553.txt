 Distribution several glycolytic enzymes lenses different vertebrate species organization calf lenses studied. Though general pattern enzyme activities different species discernible, high activities TPI followed, decreasing order, GAPDH, enolase, PK, LDH aldolase appear common. observation unusually high activities aldolase pig, enolase sheep LDH duck lens interesting view already known dual function LDH enzyme structural protein (epsilon-crystallin) duck. Controlled treatment detergents Brij-58 Triton X-100 caused distinctly differential purturbations lens cells. spite fiber membrane disruption partial actin dissolution Brij-58, significant increase release glycolytic enzymes compared control observed. suggests none enzymes existed completely soluble freely diffusible fraction. treatment strong detergent (Triton X-100) caused release higher amounts enzymes suggesting either direct indirect interaction cytomatrix components. Aldolase appears maximally bound cytosol followed TPI, GAPDH, LDH PK decreasing order. Although thin lens slices incubated detergents total period 40 min loss fiber architecture organization confirmed light microscopy, Triton X-100 treated tissues less 25% total activity enzyme except TPI appeared bathing medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
