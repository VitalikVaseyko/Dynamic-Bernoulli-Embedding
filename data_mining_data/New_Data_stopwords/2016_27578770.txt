 Intratumoral extracellular ATP concentrations 1000 times higher normal tissues cell origin. However, whether cancer cells use abundant extracellular ATP unknown recently reported cancer cells internalize ATP. internalized ATP found substantially increase intracellular ATP concentration promote cell proliferation drug resistance cancer cells. Here, using nonhydrolyzable fluorescent ATP (NHF-ATP), radioactive regular ATP, coupled high low molecular weight dextrans endocytosis tracers fluorescence microscopy ATP assays, cultured human NSCLC A549 H1299 cells well A549 tumor xenografts found internalize extracellular ATP concentrations within reported intratumoral extracellular ATP concentration range. addition macropinocytosis, clathrin- caveolae-mediated endocytosis significantly contribute ATP internalization, led approximately 30% (within 45 minutes) 50% (within 4 hours) increase intracellular ATP levels ATP incubation. increase could accounted either purinergic receptor signaling increased intracellular ATP synthesis rates ATP-treated cancer cells. new findings significantly deepen understanding Warburg effect shedding light cancer cells tumors, heterogeneous oxygen nutrition supplies, take extracellular ATP use internalized ATP perform multiple previously unrecognized functions biological importance. strongly suggest existence ATP sharing among cancer stromal cells tumors simultaneously identify multiple new anticancer targets. IMPLICATIONS: Extracellular ATP taken human lung cancer cells tumors via macropinocytosis endocytic processes supplement extra energy needs cancer growth, survival, drug resistance, thus providing novel targets future cancer therapy.
