 erythroid membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1 prototypical member genetically topologically complex family generated combinatorial alternative splicing pathways localized diverse intracellular sites including nucleus. explore molecular determinants nuclear localization, transfected COS-7 cells epitope-tagged versions natural red cell protein 4.1 (4.1R) isoforms well mutagenized truncated derivatives. Two distant topological sorting signals required efficient nuclear import 4.1R80 isoform: basic peptide, KKKRER, encoded alternative exon 16 acting weak core nuclear localization signal (4.1R NLS), acidic peptide, EED, encoded alternative exon 5. 4.1R80 isoforms lacking either two exons showed decreased nuclear import. Fusion various 4.1R80 constructs cytoplasmic reporter protein pyruvate kinase confirmed requirement motifs full NLS function. 4.1R80 efficiently imported nuclei digitonin-permeabilized COS-7 cells presence recombinant Rch1 (human importin alpha2), importin beta, GTPase Ran. Quantitative analysis protein-protein interactions using resonant mirror detection technique showed 4.1R80 bound Rch1 vitro high affinity (KD = 30 nM). affinity decreased least 7- 20-fold, respectively, EED motif exon 5 4.1R NLS exon 16 lacking mutated, confirming motifs required efficient importin-mediated nuclear import 4.1R80.
