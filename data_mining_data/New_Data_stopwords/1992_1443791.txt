 Erythrocytes young type diabetic patients (n = 11), incubated plasma anaerobic conditions, exhibited higher glucose consumption cells controls (n = 11). increased metabolic activity believed reflect erythrocyte alterations dependent degree metabolic control, glucose consumption significantly correlated glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1) glucose levels (P < 0.05 P < 0.01 respectively). Red cell hexokinase (HK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activities similar groups whereas phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity slightly higher patients' cells (P < 0.05). difference found patients controls red cell ATP 2.3 diphosphoglycerate (2.3 DPG) levels. However, concentrations glycolytic products seem also closely related glucose homeostasis diabetes. Indeed, within diabetic group, ATP levels showed negative relationship glucose level (P < 0.05) 2.3 DPG positive relationship HbA1 (P < 0.05). conclusion, higher glycolytic activity present young diabetic red cells. activity well ATP 2.3 DPG levels related degree short- long-term diabetic control. findings stress importance careful metabolic control avoid haematological disturbances.
