 effects dietary soybean phospholipid, hydrogenation product safflower phospholipid gene expression activity hepatic enzymes fatty acid biosynthesis examined fasted-refed rats. Phospholipid composition soybean phospholipid hydrogenation product same, hydrogenation product contained negligible amounts unsaturated fatty acids. Among phospholipid classes, lysophosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol proportions slightly higher safflower phospholipid soybean phospholipid hydrogenation product. Rats fasted 2 refed fat-free diet diet containing 4% fatty acids either soybean oil various phospholipid preparations 3 d. Compared fat-free diet, soybean oil diet slightly decreased specific, total hepatic fatty acid synthetase malic enzyme activity, totally ineffective modulating glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase activity experimental conditions. diets containing phospholipids, however, markedly decreased activity enzymes. extent reduction somewhat attenuated hydrogenated soybean phospholipid compared soybean safflower phospholipids. Dot Northern blot hybridization using specific cDNA probes showed that, compared fat-free diet, diets containing phospholipids profoundly decreased hepatic mRNA levels enzymes fatty acid synthesis. Soybean oil, however, marginally affected parameters. Hepatic mRNA levels enzymes correlated well enzyme activity. Dietary phospholipids therefore appear decreased enzyme activity fatty acid synthesis primarily suppressing mRNA levels enzymes. Compared soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean phospholipid still effective decreasing activity mRNA level enzymes fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, difficult ascribe potent physiological activity phospholipid reducing fatty acid synthesis entirely polyunsaturated fatty acid moiety.
