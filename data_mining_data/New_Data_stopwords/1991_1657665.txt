 5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA) riboside, nucleoside corresponding AICA ribotide (AICAR ZMP), intermediate de novo pathway purine biosynthesis, found exert dose-dependent inhibition gluconeogenesis isolated rat hepatocytes. Production glucose lactate-pyruvate mixtures half-maximally inhibited approximately 100 microM completely suppressed 500 microM AICA riboside. AICA riboside also inhibited production glucose gluconeogenic precursors investigated, i.e., fructose, dihydroxyacetone, L-proline. Measurements intermediates glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway showed AICA riboside provoked elevations triose phosphates fructose-1,6-bisphosphate decreases fructose-6-phosphate glucose-6-phosphate. effects AICA riboside persisted cells washed 10 min addition suppressed 5-iodotubercidin, inhibitor adenosine kinase. AICA riboside provoked dose-dependent buildup normally undetectable Z nucleotides. 20 min incubation 500 microM AICA riboside, ZMP, ZTP, ZDP reached 3, 0.3, 0.1 mumol/g cells, respectively. Concentrations ATP significantly modified addition 500 microM AICA riboside cells incubated lactate-pyruvate decreased fructose dihydroxyacetone. activity rat liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase inhibited ZMP apparent Ki 370 microM. concluded AICA riboside exerts suppressive effect gluconeogenesis provokes accumulation ZMP, inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
