 study conducted evaluate effect caffeine meiotic maturation porcine oocytes. Oocyte-cumulus complexes collected slaughterhouse-derived ovaries cultured 24, 32 48 h medium 199 supplemented 10% fetal calf serum, 10 microg/ml FSH, 50 microg/ml sodium pyruvate 50 microg/ml gentamicin presence absence 2.5 mM caffeine. Caffeine inhibited meiotic resumption pig oocytes effectively 24 h culture, 95.5% oocytes arrested germinal vesicle (GV) stage (control 17.8%, p < 0.05). Prolonged culture caffeine 32 h 48 h, however, resulted significant decrease inhibitory effect (GV: 13.8% 8.2%). number oocytes metaphase II 48 h culture presence caffeine significantly lower control medium (65.3% vs 94.7%, p < 0.05). withdrawal caffeine 24 h culture resulted resumption meiotic maturation, oocytes reached metaphase II 48 h. However, ability caffeine-treated oocytes develop blastocysts artificial activation lower control (5.5% vs 9.1%, p < 0.05). Caffeine treatment significantly increased cAMP levels oocytes 24 h culture, Cdc2 kinase MAP kinase activation inhibited oocytes. results suggest caffeine, similarly purine derivatives, prolongs meiotic arrest porcine oocytes GV stage, perhaps action increasing cAMP level suppression Cdc2 kinase MAP kinase activities oocytes.
