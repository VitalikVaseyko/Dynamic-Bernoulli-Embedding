 Tumor chemoresistance associated high aerobic glycolysis rates reduced oxidative phosphorylation, phenomenon called "Warburg effect" whose reversal could impair ability wide range cancer cells survive presence absence chemotherapy. previous studies, Short-term-starvation (STS) shown protect normal cells organs sensitize different cancer cell types chemotherapy mechanisms responsible effects poorly understood. tested cytotoxicity Oxaliplatin (OXP) combined 48hour STS progression CT26 colorectal tumors. STS potentiated effects OXP suppression colon carcinoma growth glucose uptake vitro vivo models. CT26 cells, STS down-regulated aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, increasing oxidative phosphorylation. STS-dependent increase Complex Complex II-dependent O(2) consumption associated increased oxidative stress reduced ATP synthesis. Chemotherapy caused additional toxicity, associated increased succinate/Complex II-dependent O(2) consumption, elevated oxidative stress apoptosis .These findings indicate glucose amino acid deficiency conditions imposed STS promote anti-Warburg effect characterized increased oxygen consumption failure generate ATP, resulting oxidative damage apoptosis.
