 Adipose tissue liver vitamin B6-deficient rats increased lipogenic capacity. Whether phenomenon accompanied changes activities certain enzymes involved metabolism carbohydrate lipid, altered transport glucose adipocytes, studied. Five glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase), two pentose phosphate pathway enzymes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), malic enzyme, ATP citrate lyase measured epididymal adipose tissue, livers kidneys vitamin B6-deficient control rats. Vitamin B6 deficiency significantly affect glycolytic enzyme levels tissues studied, dehydrogenases measured adipose tissue kidneys. Liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adipose tissue liver malic enzyme significantly lowered deficient rats compared ad libitum pair-fed controls. Adipose tissue liver ATP citrate lyase activities also significantly decreased vitamin B6 deficiency. presence insulin, uptake glucose 3-O-methyl glucose, non-metabolizable sugar, fat pads deficient rats greater uptake fat pads control rats. observations suggest increased glucose utilization adipose tissue liver vitamin B6-deficient rats directly related changes enzymes studied, case adipose tissue, may explained, least part, enhanced glucose uptake.
