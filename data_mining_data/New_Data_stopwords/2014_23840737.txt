 BACKGROUND AIMS: EGFR activation PKM2 expression instrumental tumorigenesis. EGFR activation regulates PKM2 functions subcellular compartment-dependent manner promotes gene transcription tumor growth. addition, PKM2 upregulated EGFR-induced pathways glioma malignancies. However, found PKM2 could also regulate activity EGF/EGFR signaling pathway gastric cancer cells. aimed define biological mechanisms PKM2 regulating cell motility invasion. METHODS: employed stable transfection short hairpin RNA stably silence expression PKM2 BGC823, SGC7901 AGS gastric cancer cell lines. effects PKM2 vitro determined assessing cell migration invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis used explore relationship among PKM2 proteins. RESULTS: results indicate knockdown PKM2 decreased activity E-cadherin enhanced EGF/EGFR signaling pathway gastric cell lines BGC823 SGC7901 positive E-cadherin expression. However, undifferentiated gastric carcinoma cell line AGS, lacks E-cadherin expression, PKM2 promoted cell migration invasion. Immunohistochemical analyses showed levels E-cadherin expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cytoplasmic PKM2 expression correlated other. CONCLUSION: PKM2 may play different roles differently differentiated gastric cancer cell types, finding would consistent previous clinical research. results study reveal important link PKM2 E-cadherin EGFR-stimulated gastric cancer cell motility invasion.
