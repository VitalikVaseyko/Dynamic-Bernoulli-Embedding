 pyruvate kinase Lactobacillus bulgaricus purified homogeneity. native enzyme composed four probably identical subunits relative molecular mass M(r) 72,000 +/- 4,000. unique N-terminal amino acid sequence homologous pyruvate kinases, especially type II enzymes Escherichia coli. saturation pyruvate kinase Lactobacillus bulgaricus hyperbolic ADP cooperative substrate phospho-enol-pyruvate. enzyme strongly activated glucose-6-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, increase affinity phospho-enol-pyruvate. activators seem stabilize state enzyme, since maximum activations additive, partial activations cumulated. Pyruvate kinase also weakly activated AMP inhibited fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. However, AMP fructose-1,6-bisphosphate act strong inhibitors presence strong activator, weak effectors suppress activation glucose-6-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate. mutual exclusion strong weak effectors, appears original regulatory mechanism, could reflect either binding different effectors different interacting sites competition unique polyvalent regulatory site pyruvate kinase Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
