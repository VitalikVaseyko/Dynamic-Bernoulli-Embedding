 Cancer cells display alterations many cellular processes. One core hallmark cancer Warburg effect glycolytic reprogramming allows cells survive proliferate. Although contributions environmental contaminants cancer development widely accepted, underlying mechanisms clarified. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), prototype polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, exhibits genotoxic carcinogenic effects, human carcinogen according International Agency Research Cancer. addition triggering apoptotic signals, B[a]P may induce survival signals, likely involved cancer promotion. previously suggested B[a]P-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions, especially membrane hyperpolarization, might trigger cell survival signaling rat hepatic epithelial F258 cells. Here, characterized dysfunctions focusing energy metabolism. found B[a]P promoted metabolic reprogramming. Cell respiration decreased lactate production increased. changes associated alterations tricarboxylic acid cycle likely involve dysfunction mitochondrial complex II. glycolytic shift relied activation Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) appeared key feature B[a]P-induced cell survival related changes cell phenotype (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition cell migration).
