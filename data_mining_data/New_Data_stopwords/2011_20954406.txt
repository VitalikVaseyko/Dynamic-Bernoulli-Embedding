 research aimed study effect distillage recycling ethanol fermentation, key glycolytic enzymes cell composition self-flocculating yeast. self-flocculating yeast SPSC01 medium composed 220 g/L glucose, 8 g/L yeast extract 6 g/L peptone, continuous ethanol fermentation carried dilution rate 0.04 h(-1) 1.5 L tank bioreactor. Fermentation broth collected every 3 days, ethanol volatile byproducts removed distillation, stillage high boiling byproducts recycled prepare medium instead fresh water. system run 20 days, ethanol biomass concentrations effluent decreased continuously, indicating significant inhibition high boiling byproducts accumulated within system. Thus, activities key enzymes glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, 6-phosphofructose kinase, pyruvate kinase analyzed, observed inhibited. Furthermore, biosynthesis stress response metabolites glycerol trehalose investigated, found glycerol production protect yeast cells osmotic pressure stress enhanced, trehalose biosynthesis protect yeast cells ethanol inhibition improved, correspondingly. meantime, biosynthesis major intracellular components proteins hydrocarbons adjusted, correspondingly.
