 minireview focuses early evidence roles chloride calcium ions reactions photosynthetic electron transport reluctance essential function inorganic ions process water oxidation accepted. example, Daniel Arnon's group initially refuted conclusion Otto Warburg, discoverer 'chloride effect,' chloride 'coenzyme.' reasoning chloride shown essential mineral nutrient plants. case calcium, problem first 'calcium effects' seen preparations cyanobacteria rather green plants. today status calcium chloride essential participants process water oxidation rarely disputed, nature involvement still eludes experimental inquiries. Substantial progress respect may come recent refinements application Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy study photosynthetic water oxidation.
