 Novel cis-2-methylmalonato(trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine)platinum(II) glycoconjugates derived different sugar motifs, namely, glucose (Glu-Me-Pt), mannose (Man-Me-Pt) galactose (Gal-Me-Pt) designed synthesized based third generation clinical drug oxaliplatin potential glucose transporters (GLUTs) mediated tumor targeting. platinum(II) glycoconjugates characterized (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, HRMS well (195)Pt-NMR analysis. Despite substantial improvement water solubility, conjugates exhibited comparable better vitro cytotoxicities oxaliplatin determined six different human cancer cell lines. Glu-Me-Pt shown effective cisplatin oxaliplatin improved therapeutic index leukemia-bearing DBA/2 mice model. potential GLUT transportability complexes investigated using cell-based fluorescent competition assay GLUT inhibitor mediated cell viability analysis GLUT over-expressing HT29 cell line. sugar motif found useful enable platinum(II) complexes substrate GLUT mediated cell uptake. vitro DNA adduct formation analysis investigated first time class compounds reveal intrinsic differences antitumor activity malonatoplatinum(II) glycoconjugates oxaliplatin. intrinsic DNA reactivity platinum(II)-sugar conjugates found Gal-Me-Pt > Glu-Me-Pt > Man-Me-Pt approximately oxaliplatin kinetic study formation platinum(II) adducts guanosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP). results study demonstrate usefulness glucose, mannose galactose alternative sugar motif glycoconjugation GLUT mediated drug design pharmaceutical R&D, obtained fundamental results also support potential GLUT targeted platinum(II)-sugar conjugates lead compounds pre-clinical evaluation.
