 phosphorylation alpha-subunit mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase may involved development long-term potentiation hippocampus. Study hypothesis hampered variability incorporation 32P pyruvate dehydrogenase hippocampal subcellular preparations, vitro. 32P [gamma-32P]ATP incorporated pyruvate dehydrogenase present mitochondria membrane-enriched synaptic particulate fraction hippocampus. However, presence synaptic fraction decreased isotopic labeling mitochondrial protein. effect due inhibition protein kinase activation protein phosphatase, rate ATP hydrolysis found higher synaptic fraction mitochondria (34 nmol/mg protein/min vs 14 nmol/mg protein/min). data raise variety questions interpretation vitro phosphorylation assay. concluded variability vitro labeling minimized effect ATP hydrolysis diminished use higher concentration ATP. addition, data indicate quantitative comparisons vitro phosphorylation diverse subcellular preparations must take account differential rates ATP hydrolysis.
