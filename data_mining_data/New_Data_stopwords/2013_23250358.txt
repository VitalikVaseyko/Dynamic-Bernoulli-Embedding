 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) shown influence energy metabolism. Hence, explored strategy target PGC-1alpha expression treat metabolic syndromes. developed high-throughput screening assay uses human PGC-1alpha promoter drive expression luciferase. effects lead compound stimulation PGC-1alpha expression muscle cells hepatocytes investigated vitro vivo. novel small molecule, ZLN005, led changes PGC-1alpha mRNA levels, glucose uptake, fatty acid oxidation L6 myotubes. Activation AMP-activated protein kinase involved induction PGC-1alpha expression. diabetic db/db mice, chronic administration ZLN005 increased PGC-1alpha downstream gene transcription skeletal muscle, whereas hepatic PGC-1alpha gluconeogenesis genes reduced. ZLN005 increased fat oxidation improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, insulin sensitivity diabetic db/db mice. Hyperglycemia dyslipidemia also ameliorated treatment ZLN005. results demonstrated novel small molecule selectively elevated expression PGC-1alpha myotubes skeletal muscle exerted promising therapeutic effects treating type 2 diabetes.
