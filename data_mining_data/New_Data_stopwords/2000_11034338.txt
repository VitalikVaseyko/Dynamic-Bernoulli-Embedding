 Novel affinity ligands, consisting ATP-resembling part coupled specificity determining peptide fragment, proposed purification protein kinases. Following approach affinity sorbents based two closely similar ligands AdoC-Aoc-Arg4-Lys AdoC-Aoc-Arg4-NH(CH2)6NH2, AdoC stands adenosine-5'-carboxylic acid Aoc amino-octanoic acid, synthesized tested purification recombinant protein kinase catalytic subunit directly crude cell extract. Elution enzyme MgATP well L-arginine yielded homogeneous protein kinase preparation single purification step. Also protein kinase pig heart homogenate selectively isolated using MgATP eluting agent. Protein kinase acidic specificity determinant (CK2) well proteins possessing nucleotide binding site (L-type pyruvate kinase) sites wide variety different ligands (bovine serum albumin) bind column, pointing high selectivity bi-functional binding mode affinity ligand.
