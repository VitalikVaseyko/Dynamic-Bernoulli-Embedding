 Specific activity pyruvate kinase decreases age rat erythrocytes increases fractions obtained counter-current distribution dextran-polyethylene glycol biphasic systems; enzyme inhibited ATP activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate low phosphoenol pyruvate concentrations. Specific activity change fractions greater 95 per cent-rich reticulocytes (anaemic rats); enzyme inhibited ATP activated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. results explained basis different pyruvate kinase isozymes suggest decrease activity affecting regulatory properties erythrocytes aging.
