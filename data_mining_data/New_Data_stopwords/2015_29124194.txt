 aim work evaluate whether glycolytic reprogramming neighboring cells colorectal cancer (CRC). Using postoperative material compared functional capacity oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) CRC cells, glycolytic activity inclination aerobic glycolysis, surrounding healthy colon tissue cells. Experiments showed human CRC cannot considered hypoxic tumor, since malignancy cells surrounding exhibited even higher rates OXPHOS healthy large intestine. absence acute hypoxia colorectal carcinomas also confirmed practically equal glucose-phosphorylating capacity compared surrounding non-tumorous tissue upregulation VEGF family ligands. Studies indicated human CRC cells vivo exert strong distant effect energy metabolism neighboring cells, acquire bioenergetic parameters specific tumor itself. growth colorectal carcinomas associated potent downregulation creatine kinase system. compared healthy colon tissue, tumor surrounding cells display upregulation OXPHOS high values basal ADP activated respiration rates. Strong differences normal CRC cells affinity mitochondria ADP revealed; corresponding Km values measured 93.6+/-7.7 microM CRC cells 84.9+/-9.9 microM nearby tissue; apparent Km (ADP) values considerably (by almost 3 times) lower comparison healthy colon tissue cells (256+/-34 microM).
