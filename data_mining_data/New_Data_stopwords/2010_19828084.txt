 BACKGROUND: identification organisation dynamics molecular pathways crucial understanding cell function. order reconstruct molecular pathways gene interest involved regulating cell, important identify set genes interacts determine cell function. context, mining integration large amount publicly available data, regarding transcriptome proteome states cell, useful resource complement biological research. RESULTS: describe approach identification genes interact regulate cell function. strategy relies analysis gene expression profile similarity, considering large datasets expression data. similarity evaluation, methodology determines significant subset samples evaluated genes highly correlated. Hence, strategy enables exclusion samples relevant gene pair analysed. feature important considering large set samples characterised heterogeneous experimental conditions different pools biological processes active across samples. putative partners studied gene characterised, analysing distribution Gene Ontology terms integrating protein-protein interaction (PPI) data. strategy applied analysis functional relationships gene known function, Pyruvate Kinase, prediction functional partners human transcription factor TBX3. cases analysis done dataset composed breast primary tumour expression data derived literature. Integration analysis PPI data confirmed prediction methodology, since genes identified functionally related associated proteins close PPI network. Two genes among predicted putative partners TBX3 (GLI3 GATA3) confirmed vivo binding assays (crosslinking immunoprecipitation, X-ChIP) putative DNA enhancer sequence sites GATA3 GLI3 found bound Tbx3 protein. CONCLUSION: presented strategy demonstrated effective approach identify genes establish functional relationships. methodology identifies characterises genes similar expression profile, data mining integrating data publicly available resources, contribute better understanding gene regulation cell function. prediction TBX3 target genes GLI3 GATA3 experimentally confirmed.
