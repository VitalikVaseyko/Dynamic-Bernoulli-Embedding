 aim determining possible mechanisms red cell enzyme deficiencies induced chemotherapy, deficient red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) 17 patients purified characterized. cases G-6-PD showed normal kinetics, electrophoretic mobility thermostability suggesting decreased enzyme synthesis possible deficient enzyme activity. case studied, least one PK properties modified, either affinity phosphoenol pyruvate, thermal stability electrophoretic mobility, indicating primary secondary molecular abnormality. patients PFK significantly increased affinity citrate inhibitor; however, neither quantity quality subunits seemed altered. Thus appears chemotherapy induce qualitative well quantitative red cell enzyme abnormalities different mechanisms. similar observed spontaneous leukaemia preleukaemic states. similarity poses question whether red cell enzyme abnormalities induced chemotherapy could considered first sign secondary leukaemia due treatment oncostatic drugs.
