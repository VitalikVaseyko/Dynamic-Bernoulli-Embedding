 Cancer development results accumulation genetic epigenetic changes. interacting intracellular signaling promote carcinogenesis, epigenetic networks actively transform cancer-promoting signals tumor-permissive microenvironment coordinate cellular proliferation metabolism initiation progression cancers. reported recently, NF-kappaB activated many soluble bioactive factors enriched tumor microenvironments promote switch cellular glucose metabolism oxidative phosphorylation oxygen-independent glycolysis tumor cells, addition well-known anti-apoptosis functions. epigenetic trans-generation microenvironmental factors plays important roles development cancers, particularly inflammation-related sporadic cancers.
