 HNF-4 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4) protein enriched liver extracts binds sites required transcription genes transthyretin (TTR), carrier protein serum vitamin thyroid hormone, apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII), major constituent chylomicrons low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Synthetic oligonucleotides derived amino acid sequence affinity-purified HNF-4 protein (54 kD) used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) isolate cDNA clone encoding protein. HNF-4 member steroid hormone receptor superfamily unusual amino acid conserved "knuckle" first zinc finger (DGCKG). Studies vitro-translated HNF-4 protein show binds recognition site dimer, cotransfection assays indicate activates transcription sequence-specific fashion nonhepatic (HeLa) cells. Northern blot analysis reveals HNF-4 mRNA present kidney intestine, well liver, absent tissues. DNA-binding antisera reactivity data suggest HNF-4 could identical liver factor A1 (LF-A1), DNA-binding activity implicated regulation transcription alpha 1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A1, pyruvate kinase genes. similarity HNF-4 ligand-dependent transcription factors raises possibility HNF-4 genes regulates respond yet unidentified ligand.
