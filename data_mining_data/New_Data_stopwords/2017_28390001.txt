 Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) inherited renal disease characterized bilateral renal cyst formation. ADPKD one common rare disorders, accounting ~10% patients end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ADPKD chronic disorder gradual expansion cysts form minority nephrons eventually causes loss renal function due compression degeneration surrounding normal parenchyma. Numerous deranged pathways identified cyst-lining epithelia, prompting design potential therapies. Several potential treatments proved effective slowing disease progression pre-clinical animal studies, one subsequently proven effectively slow disease progression patients, recently approved therapy Europe, Canada Japan. Among affected cellular functions pathways, recent investigations described metabolic derangement ADPKD major trait offering additional opportunities targeted therapies. particular, increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) described prominent feature ADPKD kidneys inhibition using glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) proved effective slowing disease progression preclinical models disease. time, previous clinical experiences reported 2DG, showing compound well tolerated humans minimal reversible side effects. work, review literature speculate 2DG could good candidate clinical trial humans affected ADPKD.
