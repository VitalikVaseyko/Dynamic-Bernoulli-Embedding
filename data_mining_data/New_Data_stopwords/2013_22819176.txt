 Development hyperpolarized technology utilizing dynamic nuclear polarization enabled measurement (13)C metabolism vivo high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). vivo mitochondrial metabolism can, principle, monitored pyruvate, catalyzed acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). purpose work determine whether compound sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) could aid study mitochondrial metabolism hyperpolarized pyruvate. DCA stimulates PDH inhibiting inhibitor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. work, hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate [2-(13)C]pyruvate used probe mitochondrial metabolism normal rats. Increased conversion bicarbonate (+181+/-69%, P=.025) measured [1-(13)C]pyruvate injected DCA administration, increased glutamate (+74+/-23%, P=.004), acetoacetate (+504+/-281%, P=.009) acetylcarnitine (+377+/-157%, P=.003) detected [2-(13)C]pyruvate used.
