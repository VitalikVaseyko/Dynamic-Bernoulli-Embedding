 One differences normal cancer cells lower pH extracellular space tumors. Low pH extracellular space activates proteases stimulates tumor invasion metastasis. Tumor cells display higher level HIF1alpha transcription factor promotes cell switch mitochondrial respiration glycolysis. terminal product glycolysis lactate. Lactate formation pyruvate catalyzed specific HIF1alpha-dependent isoform lactate dehydrogenase A. lactate accumulation deleterious cell, actively exported monocarboxylate transporters. Lactate cotransported proton, acidifies extracellular space. Another protein contributes proton concentration increase extracellular space tumor-specific HIF1alpha-dependent carbonic anhydrase IX, generates proton reaction carbon dioxide water. activity Na+/H+ exchanger (another protein pump) stimulated stress factors (e.g. osmotic shock) proliferation stimuli. review describes mechanisms proton pump activation reviews results studies effects various proton pump inhibitors tumor functioning growth cell culture vivo. prospects combined application proton pump inhibitors cytostatics cancer therapy discussed.
