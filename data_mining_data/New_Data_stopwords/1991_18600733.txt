 glucose metabolism Escherichia coli strain bearing mutations abolishing acetyl phosphotransferase (PTA) acetate kinase (ACK) activities studied aerobic anaerobic conditions. studies conducted complex medium mutant carrying plasmid, mutant carrying common cloning vector pUC19, mutant carrying plasmid bearing "pet" operon encodes Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase alcohol dehydrogenase activities. mutant carrying plasmid showed lower specific growth glucose uptake rates relative parent wild-type strain (K-12), Lactic acid produced higher levels wild type, considerable amounts pyruvic acid secreted unusual byproduct. Analysis fermentation products showed low significant amounts acetic acid, accumulation formic acid, lower secretion succinate ethanol. maintenance plasmid pUC19 mutant negatively affected metabolism. Expression pet operon overcame metabolic stress caused plasmid, enhancing growth glucose uptake rates values observed plasmidfree mutant. Also, expression pet operon allowed consumption pyruvate accumulated first hours fermentation.
