 50 years, known K(+) essential activator pyruvate kinase (Kachmar, J. F., Boyer, P. D. (1953) J. Biol. Chem. 200, 669-683). However, role K(+) catalysis pyruvate kinase totally understood. Previous studies without K(+) showed affinity ADP-Mg(2+) depends concentration phosphoenolpyruvate, although kinetics enzyme saturating K(+) concentrations show independence binding substrates (Reynard, A. M., Hass, L. F., Jacobsen, D. D. & Boyer, P. D. (1961) J. Biol. Chem. 236, 2277-2283). Here, explored kinetics enzyme without K(+). results show without K(+), kinetic mechanism pyruvate kinase changes random ordered phosphoenol-pyruvate first substrate. V(max) K(+) 400 higher without K(+). presence K(+), affinities phosphoenol-pyruvate, ADP-Mg(2+), oxalate, ADP-Cr(2+) 2-6-fold higher absence K(+). well fluorescence data also indicate K(+) involved acquisition active conformation enzyme, allowing either phosphoenolpyruvate ADP bind independently (random mechanism). absence K(+), ADP cannot bind enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate forms competent active site (ordered mechanism). propose K(+) induces closure active site arrangement residues involved binding nucleotide.
