 BACKGROUND: Insulin shown exert positive inotropic effects several vitro vivo models, signal transduction substrate dependency remain unclear. examined inotropic responses signal transduction mechanisms insulin human myocardium. METHODS RESULTS: Experiments performed isolated trabeculae end-stage failing hearts 58 nondiabetic 3 diabetic patients undergoing heart transplantation. effect insulin (0.3 3 IU/L) isometric twitch force (37 degrees C, 1 Hz) tested presence glucose pyruvate energetic substrate. Furthermore, intracellular Ca2+ transients (aequorin method), sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content (rapid cooling contractures), myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (semiskinned fibers) assessed. addition, potential signaling pathways tested blocking glycolysis, PI-3-kinase, protein kinase C, diacylglycerol kinase, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors, transsarcolemmal Ca2+ entry via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Insulin exerted concentration-dependent partially substrate-dependent positive inotropic effects. phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger reverse-mode inhibitor KB-R7943 completely partially prevented functional effects insulin. contrast, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor blockade, protein kinase C inhibition, diacylglycerol kinase blockade without effect. inotropic response associated increases intracellular Ca2+ transients, SR Ca2+ content, increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin exerts Ca2+-dependent -independent positive inotropic effects phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent pathway failing human myocardium. increased [Ca2+]i originates least part enhanced reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange consequently increased SR-Ca2+ load. nongenomic functional effects insulin may clinical relevance, eg, insulin-glucose-potassium infusions.
