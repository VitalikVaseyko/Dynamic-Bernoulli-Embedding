 focus targeted therapies fuelled extensive research molecular pathways role tumorigenesis. Novel models human cancer created evaluate role specific genes different stages cancer. Currently, mouse modelling human cancer possible expression oncogenes, specific genetic mutations inactivation tumour suppressor genes, models begun provide us understanding molecular pathways involved tumour initiation progression physiological level. Additionally, mouse models serve excellent system evaluate efficacy currently developed molecular targeted therapies identify new potential targets future therapies. PTEN/AKT pathway implicated signal transduction tyrosine kinase receptors heterotrimeric G protein-linked receptors. Deregulation PTEN/AKT pathway common event human cancer. Despite abundant literature, physiological role element pathway begun uncovered thanks genetically engineered mice. review summarise key animal models helped us understand signalling network contribution tumorigenesis.
