 previously shown transcription human sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene negatively regulated glucose. Using two clonal metabolic variants human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 demonstrate that: 1) although similar growth-related variations phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), frutose 1,6-diphosphatase (F1, 6-dPase), pyruvate kinase (PK) SI mRNA levels observed, F1,6-dPase, PK SI mRNA levels vary way response modifications glucose utilization; 2) regulatory elements responsible glucose-dependent transcription SI gene located within -370/+30 region promoter.
