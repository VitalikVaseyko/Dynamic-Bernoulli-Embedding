 Adenosine 5'-(S)-[16O,17O,18O]phosphate pyrophosphorylated combined action adenylate kinase pyruvate kinase. isotopomers adenosine 5'-[alpha-16O,17O,18O]triphosphate hydrolysed venom 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Crotalus adamanteus) H2(17)O. Analysis 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy resulting adenosine 5'-[16O,17O,18O]phosphate, cyclization esterification, showed hydrolysis occurs retention configuration phosphorus. likely explanation observation enzymic hydrolysis involves double displacement phosphorus covalent nucleotidyl--enzyme intermediate reaction pathway.
