 Current cancer research increasingly focused study distinctive characters tumour metabolism, resulting switch oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis (Warburg effect). Isoform 5 human lactate dehydrogenase (hLDH5), catalyzes final step glycolytic cascade (pyruvate lactate), constitutes relatively new untapped anti-cancer target. study, careful design synthesis selected series aryl-substituted N-hydroxyindole-2-carboxylates (NHIs) led several hLDH5-inhibitors, showing "first-in-class" potency isoform selectivity. Enzyme kinetics studies indicated inhibitors exhibit competitive mode inhibition. representative examples tested two human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, displayed good anti-proliferative activity, even evident hypoxic conditions.
