 Pyruvate kinase activity primary cultures hepatocytes isolated normal rat maintained constant level similar found vivo (14.0 +/- 2.8 units per mg DNA) 6 days dexamethasone insulin included medium. Yet pyruvate kinase activity decreased 50% cells cultured 2 days 4 days, respectively, presence either dexamethasone insulin alone. brief, 10 min incubation hepatocytes presence dexamethasone sufficient maintain enzyme activity cells subsequently cultured 4 days presence insulin. optimal dexamethasone concentration 1 microM. Three glucocorticoids able maintain pyruvate kinase activity cells cultured medium containing insulin. presence protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin cyclohexamide cells cultured presence dexamethasone insulin resulted 25% decrease pyruvate kinase activity. Therefore, suggested synergistic effect glucocorticoids insulin maintain pyruvate kinase activity primary cultures hepatocytes dependent upon ability cells maintain protein synthesis.
