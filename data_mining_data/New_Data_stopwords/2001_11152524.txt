 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capable infecting nondividing cells macrophages viral preintegration complex able actively traverse limiting nuclear pore due redundant possibly overlapping nuclear import signals present Vpr, matrix, integrase. previously recognized presence least two distinct novel nuclear import signals residing within Vpr that, unlike matrix integrase, bypass classical importin alpha/beta-dependent signals require energy RanGTP gradient. report carboxy-terminal region Vpr (amino acids 73 96) contains bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) composed multiple arginine residues. Surprisingly, leucine-rich Vpr(1-71) fragment, previously shown harbor NLS, full-length Vpr fused C terminus green fluorescent protein-pyruvate kinase (GFP-PK) chimera, resultant protein almost exclusively detected cytoplasm. However, addition leptomycin B (LMB), potent inhibitor CRM1-dependent nuclear export, produces shift cytoplasmic localization nuclear pattern, suggesting Vpr fusion proteins shuttle nucleus. Studies nuclear import GFP-PK-Vpr fusion proteins presence LMB reveals leucine-rich alpha-helices required effective nuclear uptake thus define unique NLS. Using modified heterokaryon analysis, localized Vpr nuclear export signal second leucine-rich helix, overlapping portion amino-terminal nuclear import signal. studies thus define HIV-1 Vpr nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein.
