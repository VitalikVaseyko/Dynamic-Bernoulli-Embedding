 Since introduction concepts allostery four decades ago, much advancement made elucidating structure-function correlation allostery. However, still number issues remain unresolved. review used mammalian pyruvate kinase (PK) model system understand role protein dynamics modulating cooperativity. PK triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) (alpha/beta)(8) barrel structural motif. PK ideal system address basic questions regarding regulatory mechanisms common (alpha/beta)(8) structural motif. simplest model accounting solution thermodynamic kinetic data ligand-enzyme interactions involves two conformational states, inactive E(T) active E(R). conformational states represented domain movements. studies provide first evidence differential effect ligand binding dynamics structural elements, major secondary structural changes. data consistent model allosteric regulation PK consequence perturbation distribution ensemble states inactive E(T) active E(R) represent two extreme end states. Sequence differences ligands modulate distribution states leading alterations functions. future work includes: defining network functionally connected residues; elucidating chemical principles governing sequence differences affect functions; probing nature mutations stability secondary structural elements, turn modulate allostery.
