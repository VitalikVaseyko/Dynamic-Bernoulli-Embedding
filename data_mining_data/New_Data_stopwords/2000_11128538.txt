 OBJECTIVE: determine clinical clinicopathologic features chronic intermittent severe hemolytic anemia characterized erythrocyte osmotic fragility Abyssinian Somali cats. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 13 Abyssinian 5 Somali cats. PROCEDURES: History, pedigree information, results routine laboratory tests, special erythrocyte studies, histologic evaluation splenic hepatic specimens analyzed. RESULTS: Age clinical signs anemia first apparent ranged 6 months 5 years. Ten cats splenomegaly. often, PCV 15 25%, low 5% times. anemia characterized macrocytosis mild moderate reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis. Hyperglobulinemia, lymphocytosis, mild hyperbilirubinemia, high hepatic enzyme activities common findings. Results Coombs tests tests infectious diseases negative. erythrocytic osmotic fragility high affected cats (mean osmotic fragility, 0.66 0.78%), compared healthy cats (0.48 0.58). specific membrane protein abnormality, erythrocyte enzyme deficiency, hemoglobinopathy identified. Histologic evaluation splenic hepatic specimens revealed extramedullary hematopoiesis hemosiderosis. Four 5 Somali cats closely related. CONCLUSIONS CLINICAL RELEVANCE: basis results pedigree analyses, apparent breed predilection, exclusion known causes anemia cats, believe hemolytic anemia cats likely result novel hereditary erythrocyte defect. genetic predisposition immune-mediated destruction erythrocytes could ruled out.
