 hypothesis brain damage phenylketonuria related inhibition pyruvate kinase phenylalanine examined rat brain vivo. One hour single injection phenylalanine rat, brains removed completely frozen less second. concentration phenylalanine brain comparable found phenylketonuric patients. Changes brain glycolytic intermediates consistent inhibition pyruvate kinase vivo. inhibition pyruvate kinase apparently compensated increase phosphoenolpyruvate; decrease adenosine triphosphate creatine phosphate found.
