 11 patients CAPD persisting anemia survival red cells labelled 51Cr, red cell mass levels several enzymes within red cells measured. 51Cr red cell survival shortened 9/11 (mean +/- SD:20.0 +/- 4.9 days) correlated red cell mass, i.e. degree anemia (r = 0.79, P less 0.01). Determinations levels enzymes hexose monophosphate shunt glycolytic pathway revealed obvious defects red cell metabolism. level hexokinase (HK) normal whereas activities glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), glutathione reductase (GR) pyruvate kinase (PK) well reduced glutathione (GSH) increased significantly. CAPD eliminate hemolytic component anemia majority patients.
