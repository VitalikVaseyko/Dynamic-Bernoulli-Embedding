 enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) moderate thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus used model system investigate homotropic heterotropic cooperative interactions enzyme. Cooperative ligand binding wild-type enzyme measured using pre-steady-state steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, steady-state kinetics. results suggest cooperative structural changes induced substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) distinct induced allosteric activator ribose- 5-phosphate (R5P). Furthermore structural transition induced binding saturating amounts PEP R5P distinct. conclusion substantiated production five mutant proteins R5P- PEP-induced homotropic cooperative transitions separated. results suggest cooperativity exhibited pyruvate kinase B. stearothermophilus conform simple two-state model. putative four-state model proposed.
