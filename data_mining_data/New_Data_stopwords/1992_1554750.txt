 Starvation 48 h elicited 74% increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase activity, measured directly 32Pi-incorporation [gamma-32P]ATP synthetic peptide corresponding major phosphorylation site E1. administration chow ad libitum previously-starved rats suppressed hepatic PDH kinase activity approx. 20% within 2 h re-feeding, relatively high activity PDH kinase associated continued suppression PDC complex re-activation. Whereas decline PDH kinase activity next 2 h, PDC re-activation fed value observed time interval. PDH kinase activity decreased fed values 8 h.
