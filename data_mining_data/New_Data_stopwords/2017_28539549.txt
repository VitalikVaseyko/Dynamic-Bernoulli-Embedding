 importance cellular metabolism long known Warburg effect; cancer cells characterized mitochondrial defect shifts towards aerobic glycolysis. Recently, many reports revealed immune metabolism key factor controlling immune cell proliferation differentiation. Resting lymphocytes generate energy oxidative phosphorylation fatty acid oxidation, whereas activated lymphocytes rapidly shift glycolysis. Especially cells, precise mechanism regulating metabolism clarified differentiation naive cells effector cells. Similar studies also carried characterize B cell myeloid cell metabolism. Metabolic regulation considered particularly important autoimmune diseases. Metabolic changes diseases might reflect chronic activated immune-status also associated pathogenesis. Here, review known altered metabolism systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mainly focusing cells B cells, contribute SLE pathogenesis. also discuss immune metabolic defects become targets future SLE therapy.
