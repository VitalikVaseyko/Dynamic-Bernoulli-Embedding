 control theory steady states, previously presented linear enzymatic systems (Heinrich Rapoport, 1974) extended nonlinear systems. basis three theorems new procedure calculation control strength control matrix developed. theory applied extended model glycolysis erythrocytes, includes also ATP-consuming processes. Also model glycolytic flux mainly controlled hexokinase-phosphofructokinase-system. control strengths pyruvate kinase enzymes 2.3 P2G-bypass negligibly small. control strength ATPase negative, i.e. activation enzyme leads decrease flux. transition states multienzyme systems definitions given mean time required transition metabolites "transient control" enzymes. Enzymes pronounced influence transition time called time-limiting enzymes. Enzymes excert strong control time-dependent processes may little influence steady state conditions vice versa. transition times ATP calculated transient states glycolysis.
