 catalytic activities several oxidative glycolytic enzymes determined gastrocnemius muscle 10 mammalian species differing body weight nearly 6 orders magnitude. expressed terms units gm-1, activities enzymes functioning oxidative metabolism (citrate synthase, beta-hydroxybutyrylCoA dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase) decrease body weight increases. Log-log plots (activity gm-1 vs body mass) yield straight lines negative slopes less allometric exponent (-0.25) typically observed basal metabolic rates. Since amount power muscle generate depends upon catalytic potential enzyme machinery (the higher catalytic potential higher maximum rate energy generation), data predict scope aerobic activity large mammals greater small mammals nothing else becomes limiting, result fact recently obtained Taylor et al. (Respir. Physiol., 1981). contrast scaling oxidative enzymes, activities enzymes functioning anaerobic glycogenolysis (glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase) increase body size increases. Log-log plots (activity gm-1 vs body mass) display positive slope indicating larger animal higher glycolytic potential skeletal muscles. unexpected result may indicate higher relative power costs burst type locomotion larger mammals, fact observed within-species studies man. However, scaling anaerobic muscle power closely assessed between-species comparisons mammals varying greatly body size.
