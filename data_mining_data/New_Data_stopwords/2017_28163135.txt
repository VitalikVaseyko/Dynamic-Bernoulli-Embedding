 Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), halogenated organic acid, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor used treat congenital acquired lactic acidosis currently early-phase clinical trials cancer treatment. DCA found inhibit metabolism irreversibly inactivating glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1-1), resulting nonlinear kinetics abnormally high accumulation ratio repeated dosing. analysis, semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic enzyme turnover model developed first time capture DCA autoinhibition, gastrointestinal region-dependent absorption, time-dependent change bioavailability rats. maximum rate constant DCA-induced GSTZ1-1 inactivation estimated 0.96/h, 110 times rate constant GSTZ1-1 natural degradation (0.00875/h). model-predicted DCA concentration corresponds 50% maximum enzyme inhibition (EC50) 4.32 mg/L. constructed pharmacokinetic enzyme turnover model, applied human data, could used predict accumulation DCA repeated oral dosing, guide selection dosing regimens clinical studies, facilitate clinical development DCA.
