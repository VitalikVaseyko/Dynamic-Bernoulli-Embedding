 technique induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging (imBI) developed obtain "snapshot" momentary metabolic status biological tissues. Using cryosections snap-frozen tissue specimens, imBI combines highly specific sensitive situ detection metabolites spatial resolution microscopic level metabolic imaging relation tissue histology. Here, present application imBI human colorectal cancer. Comparing metabolic information one biopsy 2 3 biopsies per individual cancer, classification high versus low lactate tumors, reflecting different glycolytic activities, based single biopsy agreement result multiple biopsies 83 % cases. demonstrate metabolic status tumor tissue preserved least 10 years storage liquid nitrogen, storage -80 degrees C. means tissue banking long-term preservation metabolic status possible -180 degrees C, may relevant studies long-term survival cancer patients. tumor entities, tissue lactate concentration shown correlated tumor development progression colorectal cancer. first-time diagnosis, lactate values low rectal normal tissue adenomas, significantly elevated intermediate levels non-metastatic adenocarcinomas, high carcinomas distant metastasis. inverse behavior tissue glucose concentration corresponding conditions. expression level monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4) positively correlated tumor lactate concentration may thus contribute high lactate tumors associated high degree malignancy.
