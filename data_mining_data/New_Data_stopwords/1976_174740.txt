 1. Cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinases, resolved chromatography DEAE-cellulose hydroxylapatite, catalysed phosphorylation rat liver pyruvate kinase calf thymus histones [gamma32P]ATP. [32P]phosphopeptides, acid hydrolysates pyruvate kinase phosphorylated different protein kinase fractions, displayed identical electrophoretic patterns. Phosphorylation inhibited pyruvate kinase activity. 2. Full activity restored phosphorylated pyruvate kinase dephosphorylated histone phosphatase soluble fraction rat liver. results consistent hypothesis pyruvate kinase regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions.
