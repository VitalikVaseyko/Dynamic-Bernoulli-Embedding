 Gluconeogenesis stimulated rat liver tissues 38.5% carbohydrates substituted diet 1,3-butane diol used source energy. conditions concentration substrates (phosphoenol pyruvate, malate, oxalacetate), participating coupling glycolysis gluconeogenesis, increased liver tissue; activity gluconeogenesis key enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase fructose-1,6-diphosphatase) also increased. Decrease ratio NAD+/NADH showed nicotinamide nucleotide pool acquired distinct reducing properties cytoplasma mitochondria rats maintained diet. value phosphate potential (the ration ATP/ADP/Pn) decreased experiment due increase ATP utilization gluconeogenesis.
