 adaptive immune system equipped eliminate tumors pathogenic microorganisms. requires series complex coordinated signals drive activation, proliferation, differentiation appropriate cell subsets. established changes cellular activation coupled profound changes cellular metabolism. addition, emerging evidence suggest specific metabolic alterations associated distinct cell subsets may ancillary differentiation influential immune functions. "Warburg effect" originally used describe phenomenon cancer cells relied aerobic glycolysis growth key process sustain cell activation differentiation. Here, review different aspects metabolism cells influence functions, focusing emerging role key regulators glucose metabolism HIF-1alpha. thorough understanding role metabolism cell function could provide insights mechanisms involved inflammatory-mediated conditions, potential developing novel therapeutic approaches treat diseases.
