 Understanding mechanisms allow plants respond variable reduced availability inorganic phosphate increasing agricultural importance continuing depletion rock phosphate reserves used combat inadequate phosphate levels soil. Changes gene expression, protein levels, enzyme activities metabolite levels point reconfiguration central metabolic network response reduced availability inorganic phosphate, metabolic significance changes assessed terms fluxes supported network. Steady-state metabolic flux analysis used define metabolic phenotype heterotrophic Arabidopsis thaliana cell culture grown Murashige Skoog medium containing 0, 1.25 5 mm inorganic phosphate. Fluxes central metabolic network deduced redistribution (13) C metabolic intermediates end products cells labelled [1-(13) C], [2-(13) C], [(13) C6 ]glucose, combination (14) C measurements rates biomass accumulation. Analysis flux maps showed reduced levels phosphate growth medium stimulated flux phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase malic enzyme, altered balance cytosolic plastidic carbohydrate oxidation favour plastid, increased cell maintenance costs. argue plant cells respond phosphate deprivation reconfiguring flux distribution pathways carbohydrate oxidation take advantage better phosphate homeostasis plastid.
