 kinetics pyruvate phosphorylation rabbit skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) studied coupled assay using P-enolpyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37). reaction sequence (See journal formula). Although equilibrium pyruvate kinase reaction strongly favors pyruvate production, over-all equilibrium coupled system favors depletion pyruvate, thus greatly reducing problem back reaction assay. addition, oxidation NADH malate dehydrogenase makes possible monitor system spectrophotometer. Michaelis constant pyruvate kinase found 0.9 mM ATP 7 mM pyruvate, values agree reasonably well earlier studies using direct assays. However, maximum velocity 6 mumol pyruvate phosphorylated/min/mg enzyme, much faster indicated earlier studies. results suggest metabolic significance reverse reaction muscle pyruvate kinase may underestimated. particular, data given suggest rate vivo probably comparable observed rate glycogen synthesis lactate, making possible glyconeogenesis muscle pyruvate kinase reversal without need enzymatic bypass kind employed liver kidney.
