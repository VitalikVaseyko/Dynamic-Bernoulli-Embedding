 Murine protein serine-threonine kinase 38 (MPK38) member AMP-activated protein kinase-related serine/threonine kinase family, acts cellular energy sensors. study, MPK38-induced PDK1 phosphorylation examined elucidate biochemical mechanisms underlying phosphorylation-dependent regulation 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) activity. results showed MPK38 interacted inhibited PDK1 activity via Thr(354) phosphorylation. MPK38-PDK1 complex formation mediated amino-terminal catalytic kinase domain MPK38 pleckstrin homology domain PDK1. activity dependent insulin, PI3K/PDK1 stimulator, well various apoptotic stimuli, including TNF-alpha, H(2)O(2), thapsigargin, ionomycin. MPK38 inhibited PDK1 activity kinase-dependent manner alleviated PDK1-mediated suppression TGF-beta (or ASK1) signaling, probably via phosphorylation PDK1 Thr(354). addition, MPK38-mediated inhibition PDK1 activity accompanied modulation PDK1 binding positive negative regulators, serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein 14-3-3, respectively. Together, findings suggest important role MPK38-mediated phosphorylation PDK1 negative regulation PDK1 activity.
