 liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene controlled positively insulin carbohydrates, negatively glucagon fasting. Diet-inducible models carcinogenesis obtained using L-PK gene promoter regulatory sequences control expression c-myc SV40 oncogenes transgenic mice. L-PK/c-myc L-PK/Tag animals fed carbohydrate-rich diet developed hepatocarcinomas. addition, L-PK/Tag animals developed diet-dependent, aggressive endocrine pancreatic tumors, preceded islet hyperplasia involving different analysed cell populations (alpha, beta delta). Expression L-PK gene demonstrated pancreatic tumors, rat isolated islets rat insulinoma-derived cells (RIN line), revealing new tissue specificity L-PK gene. results suggest gene may expressed islet progenitor cells different mature endocrine cells derive.
