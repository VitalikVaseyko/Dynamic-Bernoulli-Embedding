 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays important role controlling energy homeostasis envisioned promising target treat metabolic disorders. heart, AMPK involved short-term regulation transcriptional control proteins involved energy metabolism. Here, investigated whether deletion AMPKalpha2, main cardiac catalytic isoform, alters mitochondrial function biogenesis. Body weight, heart weight, AMPKalpha1 expression similar control littermate AMPKalpha2(-/-) mice. Despite normal oxygen consumption perfused hearts, maximal oxidative capacity, measured using saponin permeabilized cardiac fibers, approximately 30% lower AMPKalpha2(-/-) mice octanoate, pyruvate, glutamate plus malate succinate substrates, showing impairment complex respiratory chain. effect associated 25% decrease mitochondrial cardiolipin content, main mitochondrial membrane phospholipid crucial complex activity, 13% decrease mitochondrial content linoleic acid, main fatty acid cardiolipins. decrease cardiolipin content could explained mRNA downregulation rate-limiting enzymes cardiolipin synthesis (CTP:PA cytidylyltransferase) remodeling (acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1). data reveal new role AMPKalpha2 subunit regulation cardiac muscle oxidative capacity via cardiolipin homeostasis.
