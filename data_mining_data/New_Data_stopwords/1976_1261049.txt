 defective pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) described. abnormal PK characterized shift R equilibrium equilibrium T-state. Ko.5 substrate phosphoenol pyruvate 6 times higher normal enzyme, KM value positive effector Fru-1, 6-P2 increased. agreement shift T-state increased affinity abnormal enzyme negative effectors ATP alanine. results discussed relation abnormal pyruvate kinases.
