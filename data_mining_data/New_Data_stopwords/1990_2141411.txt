 Twelve patients (5 women 7 men, aged 19 54 years) presenting congenital, non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia due erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency investigated systemic iron overload 18 27 years diagnosis made. One patient had, beside PK deficiency, idiopathic haemochromatosis demonstrated HLA A3 B14 markers. Another, 21-year old male patient received 100 blood transfusions. patients, blood ferritin levels high 5,584 9,665 g/litre respectively. Among remaining 10 patients, 9 biochemical signs iron overload, high serum iron levels, reduced total siderophilin saturation capacity blood ferritin levels 1,500 g/litre. Hepatic histology could obtained 5 patients showed significant iron overload cirrhosis one case clear-cut portal fibrosis 3 cases. patient multiple transfusions iron overload unrelated transfusions, present absence, usually 3rd 4th decades life. finding iron overload requires preventive measures limitation transfusions elimination iron deferoxamine therapy.
