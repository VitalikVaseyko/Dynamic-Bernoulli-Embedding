 Tylophorine compounds focus drug development decades. Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities cellular targets remain unknown. used biotinylated tylophorine derivative probe interacting cellular target(s) tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds caprin-1 consequently enhances recruitment G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, cyclin D2 mRNA form ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex sequestered polysomal fractions protein expressions associated mRNA-transcripts repressed. Caprin-1 depleted carcinoma cells become resistant tylophorine, associated decreased formation ribonucleoprotein complex targeted tylophorine. Consequently, tylophorine downregulates c-Myc cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation Rb suppression processing-body formation Warburg effect. Gene expression profiling gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed downregulated c-Myc contributes anti-oncogenic effects tylophorine compounds. Furthermore, potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b elicited similar effect, c-Myc protein levels also decreased xenograft tumors treated dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly targeting sequestering caprin-1 protein c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.
