 enzymatic syntheses ATP analogs, tubercidin 5'-triphosphate, formycin 5'-triphosphate, etheno-ATP, respective mono- diphosphate described. reaction products purified reverse-phase HPLC using C-18 matrix volatile mobile phase pH 7, tributylamine ion-pairing agent. analogs required buffer somewhat different composition baseline separation reaction product reactants. elutions isocratic allowed several successive runs without intermediate equilibration column. freeze-drying pooled fractions, yield synthesized nucleoside triphosphate approximately 70%. described procedures applicable either analytical investigations semi-preparative purposes.
