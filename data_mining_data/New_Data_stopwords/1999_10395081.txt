 pyruvate kinase (PK) phosphofructokinase (PFK) occur two different forms, separable isoelectric focusing (IEF), skeletal muscle spadefoot toad Scaphiopus couchii. estivation (aerobic dormancy) proportions two forms changed compared controls; cases amount enzyme Peak (pI = 5.3-5.4) decreased whereas activity Peak II (isoelectric point = 6.2-6.4) increased. vitro incubation crude muscle extracts 32P-ATP conditions promoted activity cAMP-dependent protein kinase led strong radiolabeling associated Peak I, Peak II, reverse phase HPLC confirmed 32P associated subunits PK PFK found Peak I. Specific radiolabeling Peak PK PFK protein kinase confirmed using immunoprecipitation. total, information allowed identification Peaks II enzymes phosphorylated dephosphorylated forms, respectively, effect estivation increase proportion dephosphorylated PK PFK muscle. Analysis kinetic properties partially purified PK PFK revealed significant kinetic differences two forms enzyme. PK, Peak II (low phosphate) enzyme showed 1.6-fold higher Km phosphoenolpyruvate 2.4-fold higher Ka fructose-1,6-bisphosphate Peak (high phosphate) form. kinetic properties suggest Peak II PK less active form, coupled shift predominantly Peak II form estivation (87% Peak II vs. 13% Peak I), consistent suppression PK activity estivating muscle, part overall metabolic rate depression estivating state. similar shift predominantly Peak II, low phosphate, form PFK (75% Peak II, 25% Peak I) muscle estivating animals also consistent metabolic suppression since phosphorylation vertebrate skeletal muscle PFK typically stimulated exercise enhance enzyme binding myofibrils active muscle. Peak II PFK also showed reduced sensitivity inhibition Mg:ATP (I50 50% higher) compared Peak form suggesting enzyme estivating muscle less tightly regulated cellular adenylate status awake toads. data indicate reversible phosphorylation control activity states enzymes intermediary metabolism important mechanism regulating transitions dormant active states estivating species.
