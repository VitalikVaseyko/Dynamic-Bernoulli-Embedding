 Pi depletion proximal tubule cells isolated mouse kidney results decrease cell content fructose-2,6-bisphosphate increase rate gluconeogenesis pyruvate, malate succinate. Gluconeogenesis glycerol unaffected Pi depletion. Introduction fructose-2,6-bisphosphate cytosol ATP-permeabilized cells accompanied fall gluconeogenesis. presence external Ca2+ stimulates gluconeogenesis. cytosolic Ca2+ raised 1.8 microM permeabilization, resealed cells still require 2.5 mM Ca2+ bathing medium order perform gluconeogenesis maximum rate. Cells permeabilized presence cAMP show decreased rate glucose production. Phorbol ester stimulates gluconeogenesis provided phorbol treatment performed absence Ca2+ ions. suggested Pi depletion may stimulate pyruvate carboxylase activity facilitate entry certain gluconeogenic substrates mitochondria. also proposed important aspects control renal gluconeogenesis parathyroid hormone mediated protein kinase C.
