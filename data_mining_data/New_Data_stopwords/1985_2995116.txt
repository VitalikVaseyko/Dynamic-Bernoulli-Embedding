 livers streptozotocin-induced diabetic fasted rats showed decreased cholesterol synthesis measured vitro incorporation [2-14C]acetate. significant decrease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), pyruvate kinase (PK) also observed 7 days administration streptozotocin. enzymatic activities also low livers 72 hr fasted animals. increase glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) observed consistently diabetic well fasted rats. Suitable amounts insulin refeeding normalized alterated enzymatic activities diabetic fasted animals, respectively.
