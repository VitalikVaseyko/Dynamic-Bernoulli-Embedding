 activation AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C)-family kinase SGK1 (serum- glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1) insulin via PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signalling appreciated almost 10 years. PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1), kinase phosphorylates SGK1 catalytic domain Thr(256), known play critical role SGK1 activation. However, identity protein kinase(s) responsible phosphorylation Ser(422), site outside catalytic domain (the so-called hydrophobic motif, HM) promotes activation kinase PDK1, unclear. work reported issue Biochemical Journal, Garcia-Martinez Alessi revealed identity 'PDK2' kinase catalyses Ser(422) phosphorylation mTORC2 (mammalian target rapamycin complex 2), multiprotein kinase phosphorylates similar site PKB (protein kinase B).
