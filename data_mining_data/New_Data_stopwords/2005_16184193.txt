 Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) potent inhibitors hepatic glycolysis lipogenesis. Recently, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) implicated regulation glucose glycolytic lipogenic genes, including encoding L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) fatty acid synthase (FAS). aim study assess role ChREBP control L-PK FAS gene expression PUFAs. demonstrated mice, vivo vitro, PUFAs [linoleate (C18:2), eicosapentanoic acid (C20:5), docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6)] suppressed ChREBP activity increasing ChREBP mRNA decay altering ChREBP translocation cytosol nucleus, independently activation AMP-activated protein kinase, previously shown regulate ChREBP activity. contrast, saturated [stearate (C18)] monounsaturated fatty acids [oleate (C18:1)] effect. Since glucose metabolism via pentose phosphate pathway determinant ChREBP nuclear translocation, decrease xylulose 5-phosphate concentrations caused PUFA diet favors PUFA-mediated inhibition ChREBP translocation. addition, overexpression constitutive nuclear ChREBP isoform cultured hepatocytes significantly reduced PUFA inhibition L-PK FAS gene expression. results demonstrate suppressive effect PUFAs genes primarily caused alteration ChREBP nuclear translocation. conclusion, describe novel mechanism explain inhibitory effect PUFAs genes encoding L-PK FAS demonstrate ChREBP pivotal transcription factor responsible coordinating PUFA suppression glycolytic lipogenic genes.
