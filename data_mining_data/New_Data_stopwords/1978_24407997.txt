 Addition ammonia suspension photosynthesizing isolated mesophyll cells P. somniferum quantitatively alters pattern carbon metabolism increasing rates certain key ratelimiting steps leading amino-acid synthesis decreasing rates rate-limiting steps alternative biosynthetic pathways. particular importance stimulation reactions mediated pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. increased rates two reactions, result increased flow carbon tricarboxylic-acid cycle, correlate rapid rise glutamine (via glutamine synthetase) draws carbon tricarboxylic-acid cycle alpha-ketoglutarate. Increased flux carbon direction appears come mainly expense sucrose synthesis. net effect addition ammonia mesophyll cells thus redistribution newly fixed carbon away carbohydrates amino acids.
