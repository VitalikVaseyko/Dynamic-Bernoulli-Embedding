 Cysticercoids well 6-, 10-, 14-day Hymenolepis diminuta evaluated terms enzymatic activities related phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) utilization mitochondrial succinate accumulation. data obtained support transition toward anaerobic electron-transport-dependent succinate accumulation, characteristic adult H. diminuta, development cysticercoid adult. transition reflected prominently increasing activities PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK), malate dehydrogenase, NADPH-->NAD+ transhydrogenase, fumarate reductase. Developmental increases PEPCK/pyruvate kinase (PK), fumarate reductase (FR)/NADH oxidase (NO), FR/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity ratios also apparent. Evaluations "egg-free" immature, mature, pregravid-gravid segments adult H. diminuta revealed general greater levels activity associated immature mature segments. Whereas FR/NO FR/SDH ratios remained relatively constant segment comparisons, greatest PEPCK/PK ratio associated pregravid-gravid segment.
