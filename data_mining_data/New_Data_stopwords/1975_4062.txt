 1. Obelin, Ca(2+)-activated luminescent protein hydroid Obelia geniculata, sealed inside pigeon erythrocyte ;ghosts' order investigate effects permeability different methods preparation bivalent cation ionophore A23187. 2. Changes free Ca(2+) within ;ghosts' studied following rate luminescence obelin. possibility obelin might released ;ghosts' experiment investigated studying release inulin pyruvate kinase ;ghosts'. Less 10% inulin pyruvate kinase sealed within ;ghosts' released experimental conditions. 3. Triton X-100 (0.1-10%, v/v) made ;ghosts' highly permeable Ca(2+). presence 1mm-Ca(2+) Triton, 95-100% obelin utilized within 10-20s. 4. time-course resealing ;ghosts' 37 degrees C showed period 90min, ;ghosts' became gradually less permeable Ca(2+). ;Ghosts' remained 0 degrees C retained small concentration obelin ATP, highly permeable Ca(2+). 5. Erythrocyte ;ghosts' resealed 30min 20 degrees C rather 37 degrees C permeable Ca(2+), shown fact 92% obelin ;ghosts' utilized first 60s addition 1mm-Ca(2+), opposed 44% ;ghosts' resealed 37 degrees C. 6. Haemolysis pH6.0 rather 7.0 resulted ;ghosts' highly permeable Ca(2+) resealing 60min 37 degrees C. obelin ;ghosts', produced haemolysis pH6.0, 90% utilized first 60s addition 1mm-Ca(2+) compared 23% ;ghosts' produced pH7.0. 7. bivalent cation ionophore A23187 increased permeability ;ghosts' Ca(2+). Maximum effects ionophore (16mug/ml) obtained preincubating ;ghosts' ionophore A23187 (16mug/ml) presence low concentration Mg(2+) absence Ca(2+).
