 metastasis chief cause cancer mortality, nonetheless remains lack antimetastatic therapies clinically available. study, present indirubin derivative 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) promising antimetastatic agent. 6BIO strongly reduced formation lung metastasis well-established 4T1 mouse model aggressive breast cancer. Several major hallmarks metastatic process affected subtoxic concentrations 6BIO, inhibited adhesion, migration, invasion variety metastatic cell types vitro. Mechanistic analyses focused known targets 6BIO, silenced compound. Unexpectedly, RNAi-mediated silencing glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), modulators cellular metastasis targeted 6BIO, found affect invasive migration study. Instead, Jak/STAT3 signaling pathway appeared play major role modulation downstream migration regulators C-terminal tensin-like protein matrix metalloproteinase 2. However, PDK1 GSK3beta contributed overall response 6BIO, silencing three pathways resulted almost complete inhibition migration, phenocopying 6BIO response. Taken together, findings illustrate antimetastatic activity 6BIO basis ability simultaneously inhibit several kinase cascades involved metastasis cancer cells, supporting concept "polypharmacology" developing drugs attack metastasis, deadly aspect cancer.
