 Congenital deficiencies human pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex considered due loss function mutations one component enzymes. describe case PDH deficiency associated PDH E1beta subunit (PDHB) gene. clinical phenotype patient consistent reported cases PDH deficiency. Cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrated 55% reduction PDH activity markedly decreased immunoreactivity PDHB protein, compared healthy controls. Surprisingly, nucleotide sequence analyses cDNAs corresponding patient PDH E1alpha (PDHA1) PDHB genes revealed pathological mutations. Moreover, relative expression level PDHB mRNA rates transcription translation PDHB gene normal. However, PDC activity could restored cells patient following treatment MG132, specific proteasome inhibitor, normal levels E1beta could detected MG132-treated cells. Similar results obtained following treatment Tyr-phostin 23 (Tyr23), specific inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor-protein-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-PTK), also restored E1beta protein levels cells healthy subjects patients PDHA1 deficiency. index patient's cells contained high basal level EGFR-PTK activity correlated high level ubiquitination cellular proteins, although total EGFR protein levels similar cells Elalpha-deficient subjects healthy subjects. data indicate PDH deficiency patient involves post-translational modification EGFR-PTK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation E1beta protein leads enhanced ubiquitination followed proteasome-mediated degradation. also provide novel mechanism accounting congenital deficiency PDH complex perhaps inborn errors metabolism.
