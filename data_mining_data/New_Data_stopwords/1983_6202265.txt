 concentrations following metabolites determined freeze-clamped gastrocnemius muscle samples: glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. dihydroxyacetone phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, glycerol 3-phosphate, glycerol, creatine phosphate, creatine, glycerate 3-phosphate, glycerate 2-phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate. results showed within limits experimental error, concentration homeostasis metabolites founded least cases equilibria enzymic transformations. Discrepancies constant mass ratios measured study equilibrium constants allow free energy variation delta G keep creatine phosphate high concentration calculated. phosphoglycerate mutase system, equilibrium constant controls trained animals unchanged corresponds vitro. Training hindered glycolysis favoured phosphorylation creatine glycerol 3-phosphate. Metabolites pyruvate kinase hexokinase system cannot homogeneously distributed one space. creatine kinase system also separated hexokinase und pyruvate kinase system. compartition glycolytic process gastrocnemius muscle seems inferred results.
