 Red cells 5 healthy adults unstable mutant pyruvate kinase (PK), PK Maebashi, stored 12 months -80 degrees C freezer. exception triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglycerate kinase activities, normal red-cell enzyme activities remained essentially unchanged. Mutant PK characterized methods recommended International Committee Standardization Haematology (ICSH). Normal control PK Maebashi remained essentially unchanged characteristics storage -80 degrees C freezer 12 months. results indicate red cells stored long term -80 degrees C freezer used study unstable mutant PK.
