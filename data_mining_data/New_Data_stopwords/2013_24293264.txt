 article designed examine whether "stoichiometric" "elite models" origin "induced pluripotent stem" (iPS) cells fits experiment facts developmental biology adult stem cells field cancer research. brief, since evidence presented support stoichiometric model failed recognize factual existence adult organ specific stem cells, model rigorously tested. addition, demonstration subset cells (MUSE cells) normal primary vitro cultures human fibroblasts (the usual source iPS cells) seems origin iPS cells. Moreover, field carcinogenesis, "stem cell" versus "de-differentiation" "reprogramming" hypotheses examined. Again, using role glycolysis, known associated Warburg effect cancer cells, list experiments showing (a) normal stem cells, mitochondria, metabolize via glycolysis; (b) stem cells targets "initiation" "immortalization" blockage differentiation apoptosis stem cells "immortalizing viruses"; (c) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), expressed, associated glycolysis therefore, must expressed normal adult stem cells, well cancer cells; (d) p53, depleted rendered dysfunctional SV40 Large antigen, associated reduction mitochondrial function mass associated Warburg effect. Together, observations iPS "cancer stem cell" fields support idea iPS cells cancer stem cell derived adult organ-specific stem cells restore switch metabolism glucose oxidative metabolism glycolysis but, rather, cases, adult stem cell, metabolizes glycolysis, prevented differentiation metabolizing oxidative phosphorylation.
