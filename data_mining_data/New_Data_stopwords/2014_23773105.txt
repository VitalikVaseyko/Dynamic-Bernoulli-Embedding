 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) heterogenous group cancers arise nephron. distinct histologic subtypes associated common genetic alterations, forms RCC linked common pathway dysregulated metabolism. Reliance aerobic glycolysis, feature cancer first hypothesized Warburg, common feature sporadic hereditary forms kidney cancer. Two hereditary forms RCC, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC), characterized mutations Krebs cycle enzymes, rendering dependent glycolysis energy requirements. reliance pathways may make vulnerable novel metabolic strategies, including inhibition glycolysis, glucose uptake macromolecule biosynthesis.
