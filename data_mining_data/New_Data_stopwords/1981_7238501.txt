 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase activity studied presence L-phenylalanine analogs: L-phenylalanyl methyl ester (PheOMe), L-1-amino-2-phenylethyl phosphonic acid (PnPhe), L-alanine L-1-aminoethyl phosphonic acid (PnAla). appropriate pH substrate concentrations analogs Phe exhibited activatory inhibitory effects low (1--5 mM) high (above 5mM) ligand concentrations respectively. Activation pyruvate kinase Phe PheOMe observed pH 8.2 presence 2.5 mM ADP 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (P-pyruvate), PnPhe activation also observed pH 7.5. activatory effect followed order: PnPhe much greater Phe greater PheOMe. effectors showed mixed type inhibition activation P-pyruvate variable substrate non-competitive inhibition activation ADP variable substrate.
