 BACKGROUND: Fruit vegetable consumption protects cancer. attributed part antioxidants vitamin E combating oxidative DNA damage. Anthocyanins found significant concentrations human diet. However, remains established whether bioactive vivo. AIM: investigate consequence vitamin E deficiency oxidative damage DNA lipids cytoprotective effect nutritionally relevant levels cyanidin-3-glycoside vivo rats vitro human colonocytes. METHODS: Male Rowett Hooded Lister rats fed diet containing less 0.5 mg/kg vitamin E vitamin E supplemented control diet containing 100 mg alpha-tocopherol acetate/kg. Half controls vitamin E-deficient rats received cyanidin-3-glycoside (100 mg/kg). 12 weeks endogenous DNA stability rat lymphocytes (strand breaks oxidised bases) response oxidative stress ex vivo (H2O2; 200 microM) measured single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE). Tissue levels 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG) measured HPLC EC detection. alpha-tocopherol lipid peroxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; TBARS) measured HPLC. Rat plasma pyruvate kinase production reactive oxygen phagocytes detected spectrophotometrically flow cytometry respectively. Immortalised human colon epithelial cells (HCEC) preincubated vitro anthocyanins cyanidin cyanidin-3-glycoside flavonol quercetin (all 50 microM) exposure H2O2 (200 microM). DNA damage measured SCGE above. RESULTS: Plasma liver alpha-tocopherol declined progressively 12 weeks rats made vitamin E deficient. Lipid peroxidation increased significantly plasma, liver red cells. Reactive oxygen levels phagocytes plasma pyruvate kinase increased. Vitamin E deficiency affect DNA stability rat lymphocytes, liver colon. Cyanidin-3-glycoside alter lipid peroxidation DNA damage rats. However, chemoprotective DNA damage human colonocytes.DNA strand breakage decreased 38.8 +/- 2.2% pretreatment anthocyanin. CONCLUSION: accepted vitamin E alters lipid oxidation vivo, role maintaining DNA stability remains unclear. Moreover, whereas cyanidin-3-glycoside protects oxidative DNA damage vitro, nutritionally relevant concentrations ineffective oxidative stress vivo.
