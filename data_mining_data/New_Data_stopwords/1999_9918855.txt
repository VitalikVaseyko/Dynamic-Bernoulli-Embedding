 Endogenous control microtubule dynamism essential many cell types. Numerous microtubule-adhering proteins stabilize polymer status, protein factors described opposite effects. brain- muscle-specific M1 isoform enzyme pyruvate kinase investigated respect. Three pieces evidence indicate antimicrotubular effects protein. (1) Pyruvate kinase inhibits taxol-induced tubulin polymerization microtubules revealed turbidimetry. (2) Pelleting experiments show pyruvate kinase partially disassembles taxol-stabilized microtubules less sedimentable oligomers leading appearance tubulin supernatant fractions. (3) Electron microscopy reveals kinase-induced formation great amounts thread-like tubulin oligomers tend accumulate light/less sedimentable fraction. Immunoelectron micrographs using labeled antibody pyruvate kinase provide evidence binding pyruvate kinase thread-like oligomeric forms. present data allow assumption pyruvate kinase may display multiple regulatory functions glycolytic control enzyme modulator microtubule dynamism.
