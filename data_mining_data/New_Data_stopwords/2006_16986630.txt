 unexpectedly long, still unfinished, path towards reliable mathematical model glycolysis regulation Lactococcus lactis described. model comparatively simple pathway deduced vivo nuclear magnetic resonance time-series measurements key glycolytic metabolites. expected nonlinear inverse problem, computational challenges encountered numerical determination parameter values model. successfully solved, whereas others still awaiting improved techniques analysis. addition, rethinking model formulation became necessary, generally accepted assumptions model design necessarily valid vivo models. Examples include precursor-product relationships homogeneity cells responses. Finally, turned useful model metabolites, using time courses ubiquitous compounds adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidised) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) unmodelled input functions. respect specific application, modelling process come long way, yet completed. Nonetheless, model analysis led interesting insights design pathway principles govern operation. Specifically, widely observed feedforward activation pyruvate kinase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate shown provide crucial mechanism positioning starving organism holding pattern allows immediate uptake glucose, soon becomes available.
