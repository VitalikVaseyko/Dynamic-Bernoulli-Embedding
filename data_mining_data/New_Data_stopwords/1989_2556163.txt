 Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 using pyruvate sole carbon source produced mainly acetate butyrate end products fermentation. Acetate butyrate kinase activities higher cells growing presence pyruvate glucose, whereas level acetoacetate decarboxylase, enzyme involved solvent formation, lower. Similar activities glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase found cells grown pyruvate glucose mediums. transfer C. acetobutylicum pyruvate glucose medium suggested pyruvate represses "solventogenesis."
