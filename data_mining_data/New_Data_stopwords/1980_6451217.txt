 short preincubation submitochondrial particles low concentrations ADP presence Mg2+ results complete loss ATPase inosine triphosphatase activities. nucleoside diphosphates (IDP GDP) affect ATPase activity. ADP-inhibited ATPase activated time-dependent manner treatment submitochondrial particles enzyme converting ADP ATP (phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase). activaton first-order reaction rate constant 0.2 min-1 25 degrees C. rate constant activation increased presence ATP 2 min-1, increase shows saturation kinetics Km value equal ATPase reaction (10(-4) 25 degrees C pH 8.0). experimental results obtained consistent model two alternative pathways ADP dissociation inhibitory site ATPase exist; one spontaneous dissociation second ATP-dependent dissociation formation ternary complex ADP, enzyme ATP. ADP-induced inactivation ATP-dependent activation ATPase activity submitochondrial particles accompanied directed change ability catalyse ATP-dependent reverse electron transport succinate NAD+. possible implication model suggested discussed terms functional role inhibitory high-affinity binding site ADP mitochondrial ATPase.
