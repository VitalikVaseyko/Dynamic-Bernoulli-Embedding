 Mutations KRAS found variety human malignancies, including pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer high frequency. date, effective treatments target mutant variants KRAS introduced clinical practice. recent years, number studies shown oncogene KRAS plays critical role controlling cancer metabolism orchestrating multiple metabolic changes. One metabolic hallmarks malignant tumor cells dependency aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect. role KRAS signaling regulation aerobic glycolysis reported several types cancer. KRAS-driven cancers characterized altered metabolic pathways involving enhanced nutrients uptake, enhanced glycolysis, enhanced glutaminolysis, elevated synthesis fatty acids nucleotides. However, mutated KRAS coordinate metabolic shift promote tumor growth whether specific metabolic pathways essential tumorigenesis KRAS-driven cancers questions remain answered. context, aim review summarize current data KRAS-related metabolic alterations cancer cells. Given cancer cells rely changes metabolism support growth survival, targeting metabolic processes may potential strategy treating KRAS-driven cancers.
