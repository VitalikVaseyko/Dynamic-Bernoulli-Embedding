 manipulating physical properties oxygen, cells able harvest large thermodynamic potential oxidation provide substantial fraction energy necessary cellular processes. enzyme largely responsible oxygen manipulation cytochrome c oxidase, resides inner mitochondrial membrane. unknown reasons, cancer cells maximally utilize process, instead rely anaerobic-like metabolism demonstrating so-called Warburg effect. enzyme crossroads oxidative metabolism, cytochrome c oxidase might expected play role so-called Warburg effect. protein assay methods metabolic studies radiolabeled glucose, alterations associated cancer cytochrome c oxidase subunit levels explored. implications findings cancer research discussed briefly.
