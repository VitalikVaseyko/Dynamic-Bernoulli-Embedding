 Recent advances tumor metabolism revealed metabolic reprogramming could dramatically promote caner metastasis. However, relation mechanism metastasis metabolic reprogramming thoroughly explored. Cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion analysis performed evaluate role FAM210B human cancer cells. Human ovarian cancer xenograft model used determine effects inhibiting FAM210B shRNA tumor metastasis. Microarray analysis used determine target genes FAM210B. FAM210B cellular localization performed mitochondria isolation mitochondria protein extraction. detect FAM210B-mediated metabolic reprogramming, oxygen consumption rate extracellular acidification rate measured. previous study screened novel cancer progression-suppressor gene, FAM210B, encodes outer mitochondrial membrane protein, suppression mortality antisense rescue technique (SMART). demonstrated FAM210B loss significantly associated cancer metastasis decreased survival clinical setting. Additionally, found low expression FAM210B significantly correlated decreased survival enhanced metastasis vivo vitro, loss FAM210B led increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity reduced glycolysis downregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), activated EMT program enhanced migratory invasive properties. Collectively, data unveil potential metabolic target mechanism cancer metastasis.
