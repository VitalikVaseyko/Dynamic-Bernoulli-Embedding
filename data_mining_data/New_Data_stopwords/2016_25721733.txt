 Warburg effect well-known feature cancer cells. However, its' functional significance elucidated yet. Pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, 2 isoforms, PKM1 PKM2. reported PKM2 tumor-specific isoform promotes Warburg effect. Also, thought tumor cells switch PKM isoform PKM1 PKM2 tumor development. Here, showed switching machinery induced limited cases, based PKM expression normal tissues, brain-specific microRNA (miR)-124 muscle-specific miR-133b regulated machinery controlling PKM expression targeting polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1), splicer PKM gene. Also, confirmed PKM2/PKM1 ratio elevated PKM2-dominant organs colon down-regulation PTB1-associated microRNAs tumor development.
