 proband lifelong hemolytic anemia high K0.5s phosphoenolypyruvate (PEP) erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) variant substantially incompletely normalized allosteric modifier fructose-1,6-diphosphate (F-1,6-P2) conversion sigmoidal hyperbolic kinetics. Heterozygotes four generations express qualitatively identical less severely abnormal kinetics lack overt hemolysis. Kinetic abnormalities closely mimicked sulfhydryl modification normal PK. Three distinct clinical metabolic phenotypes characterize proband two sisters: variant PK hemolytic anemia, variant PK without clinical manifestations hemolysis, complete normality. mother, whose red cell PK entirely normal except questionably slightly low Vmax, postulated express gene products nonidentical alleles, one encoding product mildly less favorable catalytic characteristics. low PEP concentrations, proband heterozygotes PK mutant express small fraction normal PK activity despite apparent inheritance one normal allele latter. Evidence suggests disproportionately lowered PK activity may property heterotetrameric PK. Illusory abnormalities nucleotide specificity artifacts diminished substrate affinity characterizing mutant PK.
