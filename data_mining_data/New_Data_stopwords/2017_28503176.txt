 Autoantibodies (AAbs) glycolytic enzymes: aldolase, alpha-enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase prevalent sera patients blinding retinal diseases, paraneoplastic [cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR)] non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathies, well many autoimmune diseases. CAR degenerative disease retina characterized sudden vision loss patients cancer serum anti-retinal AAbs. review, discuss widespread serum presence anti-glycolytic enzyme AAbs significance autoimmune diseases. multiple mechanisms responsible antibody generation, including innate anti-microbial response, anti-tumor response, autoimmune response released self-antigens damaged, inflamed tissue. AAbs enolase, GADPH, aldolase exist single patient elevated titers, suggesting participation pathogenicity. lack restriction AAbs one disease may related increased expression glycolytic enzymes various metabolically active tissues triggers autoimmune response generation AAbs specificity several chronic autoimmune conditions. CAR, importance serum anti-glycolytic enzyme AAbs previously dismissed, retina may without pathological consequence failure blood-retinal barrier function, would allow pathogenic AAbs access retinal targets, ultimately leading damaging effects.
