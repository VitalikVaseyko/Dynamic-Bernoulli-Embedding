 Cow red cells, vitro incubation conditions, exhibit comparatively low glycolytic rate 0.56 +/- 0.05 micromol/(ml cells.h), ratio lactate formed glucose consumed 1.58. found low glycolytic rate stimulated 50--60% basal level presence variety purine pyrimidine compounds including adenosine, inosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uracil. contrast, calf red cells, much higher glycolytic rate, display discernible response agents. attempts elucidate mechanism stimulation takes place, glucose transport glycolytic enzyme activities determined presence stimulators. Glucose influx cow red cells, measured using glucose analog 3-O-methyl-glucose, exhibits low Km 117 microM Vmax 0.38 micromol/(ml cells.min), unaltered presence adenosine. hand, hexokinase, normal hemolysates cow red cells activity 0.49 +/- 0.03 micromol/(g Hb.min). found stimulated 0.73 micromol/(g Hb.min) presence adenine. pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase unaffected compound. data suggest certain purines pyrimidine compounds may exert stimulatory effect hexokinase activity, resulting augmentation cow red cell glycolysis.
