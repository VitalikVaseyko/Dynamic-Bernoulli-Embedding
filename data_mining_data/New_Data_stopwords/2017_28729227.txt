 ETHNOPHARMACOLOGIC RELEVANCE: Berberine (BBR) naturally occurring alkaloid compound found Chinese medicinal herbs Rhizoma Coptidis Phellodendri Cortex. BBR containing herbs commonly used Chinese medicine doctors treat cancers including melanoma. study, explored proteins potentially involved anti-melanoma effects BBR using computational experimental approaches. MATERIALS METHODS: Target proteins BBR predicted using reverse pharmacophore screening, molecular docking molecular dynamics. Anti-melanoma activities BBR melanoma cells examined MTT EdU proliferation assays. Effects BBR activities target proteins melanoma cells examined Western blotting fluorescence assay. RESULTS: Ten proteins implicated cancer high fit-score reverse pharmacophore screening selected potential targets BBR. Molecular docking molecular dynamics revealed BBR could stably bind four ten proteins, namely 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Cellular experiments showed BBR inhibited cell proliferation, increased phosphorylation GR p38, inhibited activity DHODH A375 human melanoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: findings suggest p38, GR DHODH potentially involved anti-melanoma action BBR. study provided chemical pharmacological justification clinical use BBR-containing herbs melanoma treatment.
