 OBJECTIVE: Effects ectopic expression agouti signaling protein studied responses diet restriction exercise C57BL/6J (B6) mice obese B6 mice congenic yellow agouti mutation [B6.Cg-Ay (Ay)]. RESEARCH METHODS PROCEDURES: Adult male Ay mice either kept sedentary exercised running wheel fed ad libitum diet restricted weight matched ad libitum-fed B6 control mice. Body composition, plasma lipids, leptin, adiponectin measured. mRNA levels leptin, adiponectin, lipoprotein lipase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 measured visceral (epididymal) subcutaneous (femoral) fat depot real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Correlations among traits exhibited one three patterns: similar lines B6 Ay mice, different slopes B6 Ay mice, and/or different intercepts B6 Ay mice. Correlations involving plasma leptin, mesenteric epididymal adipose weights, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol likely different slopes and/or intercepts B6 Ay mice. mRNA levels leptin, Acrp30, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, lipoprotein lipase epididymal adipose tissue correlated corresponding levels femoral adipose tissue. DISCUSSION: agouti protein interferes leptin signaling melanocortin receptors hypothalamus Ay mice. results consistent hypothesis melanocortin portion leptin-signaling pathway mediates effects primarily certain fat depots some, all, components cholesterol homeostasis.
