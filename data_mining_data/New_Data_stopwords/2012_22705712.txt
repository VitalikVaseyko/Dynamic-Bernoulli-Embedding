 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity thus promotes energetic switch mitochondrial glucose oxidation cytoplasmic glycolysis cancerous cells (a phenomenon known 'Warburg effect') energy need, facilitates cancer progression resisting induction apoptosis promoting tumor metastasis. Thus, present investigation, explored molecular mechanisms tumoricidal action dichloroacetate (DCA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, cells murine cell lymphoma, designated Dalton's lymphoma (DL). vitro treatment tumor cells DCA inhibited survival accompanied modulation biophysical composition tumor-conditioned medium respect pH, glucose lactate. DCA treatment also altered expression HIF1-alpha pH regulators: VATPase MCT1 production cytokines: IL-10, IL-6 IFN-gamma. Moreover, also observed alteration expression apoptosis cell survival regulatory molecules: PUMA, GLUT1, Bcl2, p53, CAD, caspase-3 HSP70. study discusses role novel molecular mechanisms underlying DCA-dependent inhibition tumor cell survival. study shows first time DCA-dependent alteration tumor cell survival involves altered pH homeostasis glucose metabolism. Thus, findings provide new insight therapeutic applications DCA novel antineoplastic agent cell lymphoma.
