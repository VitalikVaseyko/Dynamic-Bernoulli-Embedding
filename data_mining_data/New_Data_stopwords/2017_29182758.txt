 MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), completely conserved, liver-specific miRNA vertebrates, essential maintenance liver homeostasis. 22-nucleotide-length RNA regulates diverse functions cholesterol, glucose, lipid metabolism well iron homeostasis infection hepatitis C virus (HCV). Landes goose, good, fatty liver, important significance us studying miR-122 function goose fatty liver. current study, identified miR-122 goose liver expression pattern target genes. found miR-122 highly expressed goose liver expression down-regulated overfeeding; genes related lipid metabolism, including prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 1 (P4HA1); aldolase, fructose-bisphosphate B (ALDOB); pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM2), predicted validated target genes goose miR-122. overexpression inhibition miR-122 primary goose hepatocytes, expression ALDOB PKM2 changed, P4HA1, indicating miR-122 regulates ALDOB PKM2 expression mRNA level. findings suggest miR-122 play important roles goose fatty liver targeting genes related lipid metabolism.
