 method visual quantitative estimation employed determine index enzymes activity embryonal cells cultures infected Rous virus. early terms (1-7 days infection) moderate production diformazane noted presence glucoso-6-phosphatiosomerase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvatoxidase, NAD. H2- NADP. H-2-diaphorase, enzymes showing distinquishable deviations activity, compared normal culture. later terms (13-27 days) proliferation transformed cells found increased level glycolysis enzymes activity, pentose cycle, hydrolysis ortho-phosphoric acid monoethers reduced lemon acid cycle tissue respiration. Cytoplasmatic vacuoles formed transformed cells seem represent hypertrophic lysosomes phagolysosomes.
