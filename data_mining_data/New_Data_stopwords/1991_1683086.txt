 Pyruvate kinase (PK) red blood cells (RBC) three patients nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due PK deficiency characterized according internationally standardized methods. variant enzymes, designated PK 'Memphis', PK 'Bartlett', PK 'Pontotoc', 11, 60, 61%, respectively, normal enzyme activity. variant PK enzymes increased thermolability. Compared control, Km (PEP) 200-300% greater PK 'Memphis', 50% less PK 'Bartlett' 300-400% greater PK 'Pontotoc'. Km (ADP) 40 300% greater normal PK 'Bartlett' PK 'Pontotoc', respectively. variants required higher normal concentrations allosteric modifier, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, achieve 50% activation maximal enzyme activity. define molecular basis gene defect, DNA samples patients examined restriction-fragment-linked polymorphisms. differences observed structure patients' PK genes compared normal control. results consistent mutation coding sequences, rather large insertion, deletion rearrangement genetic information, underlying genetic defect accounts altered enzyme properties PK-deficient patients.
