 Na(+)-dependent active process myo-inositol (MI) uptake, sharing common carrier system glucose sensitive phlorizin, previously established primary cultures bovine retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (26, 32). present report examines nature glucose-induced inhibition MI transport primary cultures RPE cells. RPE cells grown supplemented Dulbecco's modification Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5 mM D-glucose (basic growth media) 40 mM D-glucose nonmetabolizable analogue, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside (alpha MG); 1-5 mM nonradioactive MI, pyruvate, lactate; 0.2-20 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) straurosporin (modified growth media), 4 weeks. capacity RPE cells accumulate 3H-MI (ratios intracellular transported radioactive MI, [MI]i, external free MI concentration, [MI]i/[MI]o) decreased 41% 34% cells grown 10 days longer 40 mM D-glucose 40 mM alpha MG, respectively, compared cells grown basic growth media. rate uptake 3H-MI also reduced 63 +/- 15% 48 +/- 8% control values cells fed 1 5 mM nonradioactive MI, respectively. addition, cellular capacity bind [3H]phlorizin reduced 52 +/- 7%, 61 +/- 5%, 38 +/- 6% controls RPE cells fed 40 mM D-glucose, 40 mM alpha MG, 5 mM nonradioactive MI, respectively. Growth media containing either pyruvate lactate, glucose metabolites, suppress ability RPE cells accumulate MI. 18 +/- 8% reduction [3H]thymidine incorporation DNA occurred cells grown 40 mM glucose 12-14 days, compared cells grown 5 mM glucose. Chronic treatment (12-14 days) cells phorbol ester, activator protein kinase C, caused twofold increase MI uptake, [3H]phlorizin binding, cell number, DNA synthesis. However, rates MI uptake cells grown basic growth media TPA-treated media normalized cell number, significant difference MI uptake found treated untreated cells. Addition staurosporin, protein kinase C inhibitor, together TPA, growth media reversed phorbol-induced increase MI uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
