 3-BrPA (3-bromopyruvate) alkylating agent anti-tumoral activity hepatocellular carcinoma. compound inhibits cellular ATP production owing action glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation; however, specific metabolic steps mechanisms 3-BrPA action human hepatocellular carcinomas, particularly effects mitochondrial energetics, poorly understood. present study found incubation HepG2 cells low concentration 3-BrPA short period (150 microM 30 min) significantly affected glycolysis mitochondrial respiratory functions. activity mitochondrial hexokinase inhibited 150 microM 3-BrPA, concentration caused 70% inhibition GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) 3-phosphoglycerate kinase activities. Additionally, 3-BrPA treatment significantly impaired lactate production HepG2 cells, even glucose withdrawn incubation medium. Oxygen consumption HepG2 cells supported either pyruvate/malate succinate inhibited cells pre-incubated 3-BrPA glucose-free medium. hand, cells pre-incubated glucose-supplemented medium, oxygen consumption affected succinate used oxidizable substrate. increase oligomycin-independent respiration observed HepG2 cells treated 3-BrPA incubated glucose-supplemented medium, indicating 3-BrPA induces mitochondrial proton leakage well blocking electron transport system. activity succinate dehydrogenase inhibited 70% 3-BrPA treatment. results suggest combined action 3-BrPA succinate dehydrogenase glycolysis, inhibiting steps downstream phosphorylation glucose, play important role HepG2 cell death.
