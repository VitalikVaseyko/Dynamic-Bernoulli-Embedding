 Tissue-specific isozymes pyruvate kinase particularly attractive systems elucidate molecular mechanism(s) conferring allostery. muscle- kidney-type isozymes coded gene. consequence alternative message RNA splicing, two primary sequences differ small number residues. However, exhibit different regulatory behavior. effort identify roles specific residues conferring allostery, gene encoding rabbit kidney-type pyruvate kinase cloned expressed Escherichia coli. primary structure recombinant rabbit kidney-type pyruvate kinase (rRKPK) recombinant rabbit muscle-type pyruvate kinase (rRMPK) differ 22 positions, located region forms important intersubunit contacts RMPK structure. Velocity sedimentation analytical gel chromatographic studies show rRKPK undergoes reversible dimer left right arrow tetramer assembly equilibrium constant 28 +/- 3 mL/mg. subunit assembly process provides opportunity elucidate role dimer interface transmission signal upon binding substrates allosteric effectors. assembly tetrameric rRKPK favored binding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), one two substrates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), activator. contrast, equilibrium shifted toward dimeric rRKPK upon binding adenosine diphosphate (ADP), substrate, l-phenylalanine (Phe), inhibitor. observations provide significant new insights molecular mechanism allosteric regulation pyruvate kinase system. First, substrates effectors communicate particular dimer-dimer interface. Second, thermodynamic signatures communications qualitatively different two substrates activator, FBP, inhibitor, Phe.
