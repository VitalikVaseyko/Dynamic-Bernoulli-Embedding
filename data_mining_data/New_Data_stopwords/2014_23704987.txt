 Ptc6 one seven components (Ptc1-Ptc7) protein phosphatase 2C family yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. contrast type 2C phosphatases, cellular role isoform poorly understood. present comprehensive characterization gene product. Cells lacking Ptc6 sensitive zinc ions, somewhat tolerant cell-wall damaging agents Li(+). Ptc6 mutants sensitive rapamycin, albeit lesser extent ptc1 cells. phenotype rescued overexpression PTC1 mutation ptc6 reproduce characteristic genetic interactions ptc1 mutation components TOR pathway, thus suggesting different cellular roles isoforms. show rapamycin-sensitive phenotype ptc6 cells unrelated reported role Pt6 controlling pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Lack Ptc6 results substantial attenuation transcriptional response rapamycin, particularly subset repressed genes encoding ribosomal proteins involved rRNA processing. contrast, repressed genes involved translation Ptc6-independent. effects cannot attributed regulation Sch9 kinase, could involve modulation binding Ifh1 co-activator specific gene promoters.
