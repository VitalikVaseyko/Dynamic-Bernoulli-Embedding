 Urothelial carcinoma common form bladder cancer, pathway changes occur stage-wise progression well defined. used metabolomics approach identify potential metabolic pathways uniquely altered normal urothelium, nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). performed global metabolomic profiling using GC-mass spectrometry (MS) LC-MS platforms identify metabolite signatures normal urothelium high-grade urothelial carcinoma different stages. Pathways globally dysregulated cancer relative normal urothelium included glucose, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide pathways. Urothelial carcinoma showed elevated glucose utilization glycolysis increased sorbitol pathway intermediates, consistent Warburg effect. Anaplerosis sustain energy production suggested increased late TCA cycle intermediates, amino acids, dipeptides occurs bladder cancer. Urothelial carcinoma also shows altered membrane lipid membrane metabolism differential derivation nucleic acid components pyrimidine purine. stage comparison, MIBC appears preferentially enhance cyclooxygenase (COX) lipoxygenase (LOX) signaling, increase heme catabolism, alter nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis possible influence associated inflammatory cells. identify numerous metabolomic alterations NMIBC MIBC likely reflect underlying pathway changes. Differential pathway activity may value designing stage-specific novel therapeutics urothelial carcinoma.
