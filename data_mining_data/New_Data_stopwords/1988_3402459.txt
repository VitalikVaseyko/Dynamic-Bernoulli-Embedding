 3-Methyladenine generally used inhibitor autophagy [P. O. Seglen & P. B. Gordon (1982) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 79, 1889-1892]. Using isolated hepatocytes, observed 3-methyladenine effects well. 1. 3-Methyladenine promoted glycogen breakdown inhibited flux phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. effects proved unrelated inhibition autophagic proteolysis caused cAMP, slightly increased presence 3-methyladenine. 2. Addition 3-methyladenine intact hepatocytes increased intralysosomal pH caused lower density lysosomal population upon centrifugation Percoll density gradient. increase intralysosomal pH effected 3-methyladenine isolated lysosomes.
