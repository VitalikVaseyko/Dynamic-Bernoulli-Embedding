 Previously, shown Pck1 expression mammary gland adipocytes white adipose tissue maintains triglyceride stores glyceroneogenesis, lipids used synthesis milk triglycerides lactation. Reduced milk triglycerides lactation resulted patterning newborn insulin resistance. study, role Pck1 mammary gland epithelial cells analyzed. developmental expression Pck1 decreased isolated mouse mammary gland epithelial cells development lactation. Using HC11, clonal mammary epithelial cell line, found Janus kinase 2 signal transducers activators transcription 5 AKT pathways contributed repression Pck1 mRNA prolactin. pathways necessitate three accessory factor regions Pck1 promoter repression prolactin. Using [U-(13)C(6)]glucose, [U-(13)C(3)]pyruvate, [U-(13)C(3)]glycerol HC11 cells, determined Pck1 functions pathway conversion gluconeogenic precursors glucose contributes glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis glyceroneogenesis. Therefore, Pck1 plays important role mammary gland adipocytes epithelial cells lactation.
