 1. ;initial activity' pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex whole tissue mitochondrial extracts lactating rat mammary glands greatly decreased 24 48h starvation rats. Injection insulin glucose starved rats 60min removal glands abolished difference ;initial activities'. 2. ;total activity' enzyme complex extracts revealed incubation presence free Mg(2+) Ca(2+) ions (more 10 0.1mm respectively) crude preparation pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Starvation alter ;total activity'. assumed decline ;initial activity' enzyme complex derived glands starved animals due increased phosphorylation alpha-subunit intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. 3. Starvation led increase intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity whole tissue mitochondrial extracts. Injection insulin starved animals 30min removal lactating mammary glands abolished increase pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity whole-tissue extracts. 4. Pyruvate (1mm) prevented ATP-induced inactivation enzyme complex mitochondrial extracts glands fed animals. similar extracts starved animals pyruvate ineffective. 5. Starvation led decline activity pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase mitochondrial extracts, whole-tissue extracts. 6. changes activity intrinsic kinase phosphatase pyruvate dehydrogenase complex lactating rat mammary gland explicable current theories regulation complex.
