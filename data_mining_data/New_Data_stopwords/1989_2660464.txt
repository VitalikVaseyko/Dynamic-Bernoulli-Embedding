 effects poor codon bias secondary structure formation upon translation pyruvate kinase (PYK1) mRNA investigated Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following insertion mutagenesis 5'-end PYK1 coding region, gene transformed yeast, translation assessed directly vivo determining distribution modified PYK1 mRNAs across polysomes fractionated sucrose density gradient centrifugation. chromosomally-encoded (wild-type) PYK1 mRNA, actin, ribosomal protein L3 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs used control minor differences polysome preparations. insertion containing 13 non-preferred codons 5'-end coding region found significant effect upon PYK1 mRNA translation. contrast, translation inhibited insertion increased formation secondary structures 5'-end mRNA (overall delta G = -36.6 kcal/mol). Control insertions also analysed exclude possibility alterations amino acid sequence pyruvate kinase affect translation mRNA. insertions, introduced preferred codons restored wild-type levels secondary structure formation, significantly influence PYK1 mRNA translation.
