 previously shown triglycerides specifically hydrolyzed lipase Rhizopus arrhizus presence hog liver esterase sodium dodecyl sulfate. glycerol produced measured sequential reactions glycerokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase: glycerol ATP converted glycerol-3-phosphate ADP glycerokinase; ADP reacts phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate kinase yield pyruvate; pyruvate converted lactate lactate dehydrogenase, cofactor NAD+ simultaneously reduced NADH. report describes procedures either disappearance NADH appearance NAD+ determined fluorometrically, 10- 100-fold greater sensitivity spectrophotometry. addition, enzymatic cycling NAD+ used increase sensitivity assay 1000-fold, thereby provided accurate measurement less 1 ng triglyceride. Results obtained three fluorometric methods highly correlated automated periodate oxidation method using serum samples lipid extracts muscle tissue.
