 D-type cyclins (D1, D2 D3) associated cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 CDK6) components core cell cycle machinery drives cell proliferation. Inhibitors CDK4 CDK6 currently tested clinical trials patients several cancer types, promising results. Here, using human cancer cells patient-derived xenografts mice, show cyclin D3-CDK6 kinase phosphorylates inhibits catalytic activity two key enzymes glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase M2. re-directs glycolytic intermediates pentose phosphate (PPP) serine pathways. Inhibition cyclin D3-CDK6 tumour cells reduces flow PPP serine pathways, thereby depleting antioxidants NADPH glutathione. This, turn, increases levels reactive oxygen species causes apoptosis tumour cells. pro-survival function cyclin D-associated kinase operates tumours expressing high levels cyclin D3-CDK6 complexes. propose measuring levels cyclin D3-CDK6 human cancers might help identify tumour subsets undergo cell death tumour regression upon inhibition CDK4 CDK6. Cyclin D3-CDK6, ability link cell cycle cell metabolism, represents particularly powerful oncoprotein affects cancer cells several levels, property exploited anti-cancer therapy.
