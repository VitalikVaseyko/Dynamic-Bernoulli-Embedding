 Several monovalent cations ideal physical properties investigation interactions biomacromolecules NMR techniques. 7Li+, 14NH4+, 133Cs+ high natural abundance, enriched samples 6Li+ 15NH4+ easily obtained. nuclei share common property narrow line widths, thereby providing high sensitivity NMR experiments. Numerous 23Na+ NMR studies reported 39K+, 85Rb+, 87Rb+ studied extensively nuclei low sensitivity broad line widths. Recently NMR studies monovalent cations extended explore monovalent cation sites enzymes activated cations. pyruvate kinase determined extent activation elicited monovalent cations correlated well distance monovalent divalent cations (structural site) sites. ions best activators closest M2+ site. course investigation developed general method determine correlation times dipolar relaxation monovalent cation sites paramagnetic centers enzymes, extended work enzymes activated monovalent cations.
