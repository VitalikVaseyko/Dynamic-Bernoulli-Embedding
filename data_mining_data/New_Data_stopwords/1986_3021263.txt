 Pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient RBCs several unexplained metabolic abnormalities, decreased concentrations total adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, ATP) total (oxidized reduced) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) intermediate synthesis adenine nucleotides NAD, investigated PRPP synthetase (PRPPS), enzyme responsible PRPP synthesis. enzyme regulated, part, changes state subunit aggregation. proportion aggregated PRPPS altered vitro ATP 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). PK-deficient RBCs decreased ATP increased DPG concentrations, examined state subunit aggregation PRPPS RBCs normal PK-deficient subjects, using gel permeation chromatography. Young normal RBCs aggregated PRPPS older RBCs. contrast, due decreased ATP increased DPG concentrations, PK-deficient RBCs contain less aggregated PRPPS RBCs comparable age without PK deficiency. data suggest PRPPS less active vivo PK-deficient RBCs. may play key role mediating decreases total adenine nucleotide total NAD concentrations RBCs.
