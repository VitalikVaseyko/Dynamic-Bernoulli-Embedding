 unveil metabolic impact tellurite bacterial cell, effect toxicant expression activity key enzymes Escherichia coli glycolytic pathway analyzed. E. coli exposure tellurite results in: (i) increased glucose consumption, paralleled increased expression glucose transporter-encoding gene ptsG, (ii) augmented phosphoglucoisomerase activity pgi transcription, (iii) decreased activity enzymatic regulators phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. spite observations, increased intracellular pyruvate, phosphoenol pyruvate phosphorylated sugars observed. E. coli lacking key glycolytic enzymes considerably sensitive tellurite parental, isogenic, wild type strain. Taken together, results suggest increasing availability key metabolites (pyruvate, phosphoenol pyruvate, NADPH), required respond tellurite mediated-stress, E. coli shifts carbon flux towards pentose phosphate pathway thus facilitating functioning Entner-Doudoroff pathway and/or glycolytic productive phase.
