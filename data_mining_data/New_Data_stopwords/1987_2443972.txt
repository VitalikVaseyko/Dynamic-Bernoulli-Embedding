 heart, glycolysis may preferential source adenosine triphosphate (ATP) membrane functions. study patch-clamp technique used study potassium channels sensitive intracellular ATP levels permeabilized ventricular myocytes. Activation K+ channels implicated marked cellular K+ loss leading electrophysiological abnormalities arrhythmias myocardial ischemia. results showed glycolysis effective oxidative phosphorylation preventing ATP-sensitive K+ channels opening. Experiments excised inside-out patches suggested key glycolytic enzymes located membrane adjacent cytoskeleton near channels may account preference glycolytic ATP.
