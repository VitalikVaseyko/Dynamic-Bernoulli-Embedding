 cultures human rat fetal liver, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity increases first 24 hr culturing. increase suppressed adding cycloheximide culture medium adding high glucose concentration. This, however, applies human fetal liver fetal liver rats obtained term. younger rat fetal liver, glucose, contrary, increases activity phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. high glucose concentration medium also leads higher citrate cleavage enzyme activity lower alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase (cytoplasmic) activity rat fetal liver cultures.
