 intracellular human bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis pursues effective strategies protect infected cells death-inducing stimuli. Here, show Chlamydia trachomatis infection evokes 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDPK1) signaling ensure completion developmental cycle, leading phosphorylation stabilization MYC. Using biochemical approaches imaging demonstrate Chlamydia-induced PDPK1-MYC signaling induces host hexokinase II (HKII), becomes enriched translocated mitochondria. Strikingly, preventing HKII interaction mitochondria using exogenous peptides triggers apoptosis infected cells inhibiting either PDPK1 MYC, also disrupts intracellular development Chlamydia trachomatis. findings identify previously unknown pathway activated Chlamydia infection, exhibits pro-carcinogenic features. Targeting PDPK1-MYC-HKII-axis may provide strategy overcome therapeutic resistance infection.
