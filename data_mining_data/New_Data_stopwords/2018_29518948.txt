 regulation hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion plays important role pathogenesis dyslipidemia fatty liver diseases. VLDL controlled hepatic microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). Mttp regulated carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) small heterodimer partner (SHP). However, unclear whether coordinately regulate Mttp expression VLDL secretion. Here, adenoviral overexpression ChREBP SHP rat primary hepatocytes induced suppressed Mttp mRNA, respectively. However, Mttp induction ChREBP much potent suppression SHP. Promoter assays Mttp liver type pyruvate kinase gene revealed SHP ChREBP affect transcriptional activity other. Mttp mRNA protein levels Shp(-/-) mice similar wild-types; however, Chrebp(-/-)Shp(-/-) Chrebp(-/-) mice significantly much lower. Consistent this, VLDL particle number VLDL secretion rates Shp(-/-) mice similar wild-types much lower Chrebp(-/-) Chrebp(-/-)Shp(-/-) mice. findings suggest ChREBP, rather SHP, regulates VLDL secretion normal conditions ChREBP SHP affect transcriptional activities other.
