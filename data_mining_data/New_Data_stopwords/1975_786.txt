 method presented simultaneous assay buccal enzymes measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine triphosphate aid bioluminescence luciferase extracts. activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) shown earlier increased homogeneous leukoplakias oral mucosa. Since smoking implicated etiologic factor leukoplakia, G6PDH measured normal buccal epithelium cigarette smokers. difference found activity G6PDH smokers nonsmokers related activity pyruvate kinase, known invariable healthy leukoplakic oral mucosa. new compact kinetic luminescence analyzer briefly described.
