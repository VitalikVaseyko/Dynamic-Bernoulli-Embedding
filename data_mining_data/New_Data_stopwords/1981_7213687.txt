 Homogenates posterior latissimus dorsi muscle, phasic muscle, fractionated one-step zonal centrifugation technique four major organelle populations cytoplasmic constituents. were: (1) Plasma membrane fragments modal equilibrium density 1.10 containing 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphodiesterase, p-nitrophenylphosphatase acid phosphatase (beta-glycerophosphate used substrate). (2) Sarcoplasmic reticular fragments could subdivided calcium transport vesicles, model equilibrium density 1.16, exhibited calcium uptake; K+-ATPase; leucyl-bet-naphthylamidase; acid phosphodiesterase; acid phosphatase (using cytidine monophosphate substrate); sarcoplasmic reticular lysosomes, model equilibrium density 1.18, possessing dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase II, cathepsin D, alpha-glucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, NADH oxidase activity. (3) Mitochondria modal equilibrium density 1.21. (4) Catalase-containing vesicles modal equilibrium density 1.22; cytoplasmic constituents (modal density 1.25) phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, myosin-ATPase, aldolase, protein RNA content. purity organelles equal better previous efforts, 30-fold purification achieved 5'-nucleotidase alkaline phosphodiesterase. results lend support hypothesis sarcoplasmic reticulum phasic muscle, addition specialized role excitation-contraction coupling, represents multifunctional membrane system, that, similar smooth endoplasmic reticulum cells, includes membrane-bound lysosomal enzymes NADH oxidase.
