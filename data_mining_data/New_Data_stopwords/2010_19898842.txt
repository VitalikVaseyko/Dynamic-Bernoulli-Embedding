 Fluorescent-labeled invertase, hyperglycosylated mannoprotein Saccharomyces cerevisiae, found bind Lactococcus lactis IL1403 acidic pH. Proteins cell wall bacterium affinity-purified using invertase ligand identified heat shock proteins DnaK GroEL glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. DnaK bound bacterium yeast pH 4 aggregated 0.1 mg/ml, whereas significant difference circular dichroism spectra DnaK pH 4 7 observed. results indicate cytosolic proteins, including DnaK displayed cell wall, cause lactic acid bacterium adhere yeast.
