 Experimental hyperthyroidism induced administration tri-iodothyronine (T3; 100 micrograms/100 g body wt; 3 days) increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids fed state rat. time, hepatic PDH kinase responded persistent (1.6-fold) increase activity. exposure hepatocytes fed euthyroid rats T3 (100 nM) culture 21 h increased PDH kinase activity extent comparable observed vivo response hyperthyroidism. vitro increase PDH kinase activity suppressed insulin (100 microU/ml) inhibition mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. results demonstrate direct hepatic action T3 increase PDH kinase activity, mediated intramitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA product beta-oxidation, facilitated hepatic insulin resistance.
