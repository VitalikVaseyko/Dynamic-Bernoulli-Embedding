 Biochemical pathways involved energy metabolism examined kidney heat-acclimated hamsters. found heat acclimation caused 47% reduction glucose-6-phosphatase (G1c-6-Pase) activity 40% lower rate gluconeogenesis. changes found activity hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, kidney glycogen content. Isolated kidney mitochondria heat-acclimated hamsters utilized 15% less oxygen controls, differences found P/O ratio. Determination content cytochromes showed significant reduction cytochromes c + c1, difference found content cytochromes a, a3, b. results suggest kidney plays role reduction energy metabolism process heat acclimation.
