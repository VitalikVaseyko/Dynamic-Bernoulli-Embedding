 work evaluated several genes involved gluconeogenesis, glycolysis glycogen metabolism, major pathways carbohydrate catabolism anabolism, BME26 Rhipicephalus microplus embryonic cell line. Genetic catalytic control genes enzymes associated pathways modulated alterations energy resource availability (primarily glucose). BME26 cells media investigated using three different glucose concentrations, changes transcription levels target genes response carbohydrate utilization assessed. results indicate several genes, glycogen synthase (GS), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose-6 phosphatase (GP) displayed mutual regulation response glucose treatment. Surprisingly, transcription gluconeogenic enzymes found increase alongside glycolytic enzymes, especially pyruvate kinase, high glucose treatment. addition, RNAi data study revealed transcription gluconeogenic genes BME26 cells controlled GSK-3. Collectively, results improve understanding glucose metabolism regulated genetic level tick cells.
