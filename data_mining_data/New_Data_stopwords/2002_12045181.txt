 c-erbB receptors usually located cell membranes activated extracellular binding EGF-like growth factors. Unexpectedly, using immunofluorescence found high levels c-erbB-3 within nuclei MTSV1-7 immortalized nonmalignant human mammary epithelial cells. Nuclear localization mediated COOH terminus c-erbB-3, nuclear localization signal identified site-directed mutagenesis transfer signal chicken pyruvate kinase. nuclear export inhibitor caused accumulation c-erbB-3 nuclei mammary epithelial cell lines demonstrated immunofluorescence biochemical cell fractionation, suggesting c-erbB-3 shuttles nuclear nonnuclear compartments cells. Growth MTSV1-7 permeable filters induced epithelial polarity concentration c-erbB-3 within nucleoli. However, c-erbB-3 ligand heregulin beta1 shifted c-erbB-3 nucleolus nucleoplasm cytoplasm. subcellular localization c-erbB-3 obviously depends exogenous stimuli stage epithelial polarity challenges specific function c-erbB-3 transmembrane receptor protein arguing additional, yet unidentified, roles c-erbB-3 within nucle(ol)us mammary epithelial cells.
