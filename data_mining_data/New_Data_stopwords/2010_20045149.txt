 Insulin causes inotropic effects via Ca(2+)-dependent Ca(2+)-independent pathways. latter one potentially glucose dependent. examined inotropic responses signal transduction insulin human atrial myocardium diabetic nondiabetic patients test role glucose transporters. Experiments performed isolated atrial myocardium 88 patients undergoing cardiac surgery 28 ventricular muscle samples explanted hearts. Influence insulin (0.02 micromol/L) isometric twitch force examined without blocking glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 translocation (latrunculin), sodium-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) 1 (phlorizin, T-1095A), PI3-kinase (wortmannin). Experiments performed Tyrode solution containing glucose pyruvate energetic substrate. Messenger RNA expression glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT4, SGLT1, SGLT2) analyzed atrial ventricular myocardium diabetic nondiabetic patients. Developed force increases insulin (to 117.8% +/- 2.4% 115.8% +/- 1.9%) trabeculae patients without diabetes. Inotropic effect reduced displacing glucose pyruvate well PI3-kinase inhibition (to 103% +/- 2%) inhibition glucose transporters GLUT4 (to 105% +/- 2%) SGLT1 (phlorizin 106% +/- 2%, T-1095A 105% +/- 2%), without differences 2 groups. glucose-free pyruvate-containing solution, inhibition PI3-kinase blocking glucose transporters resulted inhibitory effects. Messenger RNA expression show significant differences patients without diabetes. Insulin exerts positive inotropic effects human atrial myocardium. effects mediated via PI3-kinase-sensitive glucose-transport-sensitive pathway. Differences functional effects messenger RNA expression glucose transporters detectable patients without diabetes.
