 Uniparental embryos instrumental studying imprinting contributions parental genomes determined unambiguously. study, set identify imprinted genes showing differential expression parthenogenetic fertilized embryos preimplantation early postimplantation stages development. identified three genes--apolipoprotein E, pyruvate kinase-3, protein phosphatase 1 gamma--that represent excellent candidates imprinted genes, based results differential screen, function differentiation cell cycle, location within imprinted chromosomal regions. addition, two novel genes expressed trophoblast identified, 1661 RA81. genes, together four known imprinted genes, H19, Igf2r, Igf2, Snrpn, showed evidence expression parental alleles early stage embryos, indicating role postfertilization processes regulating imprinted gene function.
