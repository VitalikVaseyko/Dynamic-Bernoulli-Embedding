 AIMS: Cancer cells, due Warburg effect, dependent glycolysis normal cells, glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BP) proposed promising candidate anticancer therapy. Overexpression multidrug transporters main reason resistance cancer cells chemotherapy. activity multidrug transporters imposes energetic burden cells, expected inhibition ATP generation may exert selective cytotoxicity cells overexpressing multidrug transporters. aim study compare effect 3-BP survival ATP level MDCK-II cells MDCK-II cells overexpressing ABCB1 (Pgp) ABCG2 (BCRP). MAIN METHODS: Cell survival measured resazurin neutral red. ATP level assayed luciferin/luciferase kit. Luteolin transport measured original method described paper. KEY FINDINGS: 3-BP (10-200muM) induced decrease ATP level 1-h incubation cell lines studied, drastically ABCB1-overexpressing cells. 50 200muM 3-BP significantly decreased cell viability; effect pronounced ABCB1-overexpressing cells. PSC833, inhibitor ABCB1, ameliorated toxic effect 3-BP MDCK-II ABCB1 cells MDCK-II cells. 3-BP inhibited luteolin transport MDCK-II ABCG2 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: results indicate 3-BP shows selective toxicity ABCB1- ABCG2-overexpressing cells, apparently due enhanced ATP depletion manner independent transport activity Pgp, suggesting novel mechanism hypersensitivity ABCB1-overexpressing cells 3-BP.
