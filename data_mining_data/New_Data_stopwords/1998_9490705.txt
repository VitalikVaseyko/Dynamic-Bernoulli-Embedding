 Pk-1slc gene encodes mutant red blood cell (RBC) type pyruvate kinase (PK), adult CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice show severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. However, number RBCs proportion reticulocytes comparable neonatal CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice control -+/+ mice. Since age-dependent increase RBCs much greater CBA-+/+ mice CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice, significant anemia observed latter mice day 14 birth. increase RBCs CBA-+/+ mice due prolongation survival time. half life RBCs increased CBA-+/+ mice ages, decreased CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice. relatively longer half life RBCs neonatal CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice appeared due delayed switching M2-type PK expressed undifferentiated erythroid precursor cells RBC-type PK expressed mature RBCs.
