 Erythroid Kruppel-like Factor (EKLF/KLF-1) erythroid-specific transcription factor contains three C(2)H(2) zinc fingers required correct chromatin structure expression beta-globin locus. However, regions within EKLF protein serve signals nuclear localization proteins may enable become localized unknown. Two approaches used address issues. First, green fluorescent protein pyruvate kinase fused EKLF domains, localization monitored quantitated confocal microscopy. Two necessary sufficient nuclear localization signals (NLSs) identified: one (NLS1) adjacent zinc finger DNA binding domain within highly basic stretch amino acids (275-296), another efficient signal (NLS2) within zinc finger domain (amino acids 293-376). Interestingly, zinc finger contributes overall effectiveness NLS2 requires intact finger structure. Second, NLS tested vitro binding importin proteins. Surprisingly, EKLF NLSs, principally zinc finger domain, bind importin alpha importin beta. findings demonstrate two nuclear localization signals target EKLF nucleus suggest transport relies primarily novel zinc finger/importin protein interaction.
