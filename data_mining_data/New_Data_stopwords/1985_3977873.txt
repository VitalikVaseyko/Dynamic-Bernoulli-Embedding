 highly specific radiosandwich assay hepatic type-L pyruvate kinase (PK) determinants developed. assay used evaluate changes PK specific activity occur starvation feeding high-carbohydrate diet. Despite large increase catalytic activity immunoreactive protein, calculated specific activity falls feeding, opposite effect occurs starvation. change attributed disproportionate changes immunoreactive protein compared changes catalytic activity.
