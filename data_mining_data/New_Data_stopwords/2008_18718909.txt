 switch cellular metabolism mitochondrial respiration glycolysis hallmark cancer cells associated tumor malignancy. However, mechanism metabolic switch remains largely unknown. Herein, reported hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-3 (PDK3) expression leading inhibition mitochondrial respiration. Promoter activity assay, small interference RNA knockdown assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated hypoxia-induced PDK3 gene activity regulated HIF-1 transcriptional level. Forced expression PDK3 cancer cells resulted increased lactic acid accumulation drugs resistance, whereas knocking PDK3 inhibited hypoxia-induced cytoplasmic glycolysis cell survival. data demonstrated increased PDK3 expression due elevated HIF-1alpha cancer cells may play critical roles metabolic switch cancer progression chemoresistance cancer therapy.
