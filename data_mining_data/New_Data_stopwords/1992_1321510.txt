 effect ADP receptor antagonists ATP adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-PCP), ADP-utilizing enzyme systems creatine phosphokinase/creatine phosphate (CPK/CP) pyruvate kinase/phosphoenol pyruvate (PK/PEP) platelet deposition onto type collagen examined. vitro perfusion system used, allowed continuous visualization deposition fluorescently labelled platelets. system also provide well-controlled rheology, precise quantification deposition, allowed use heparinized whole human blood (3 u/ml). Heparinization level permits local generation thrombin near surface platelet aggregates. contribution ADP thus studied combined effects thrombin, thromboxane A2, aggregating agents present. Results studies indicate ATP capable inhibiting deposition 60% 1 microM 90% 5 microM (whole blood conc.). AMP-PCP inhibited deposition dose dependent manner Ki approximately 80 microM maximum inhibition 60%. Inhibition CPK/CP measured 20, 40, 60 u/ml, approximately 45% inhibition achieved latter two concentrations. PK/PEP 60 u/ml resulted 70% inhibition. results support role ADP mediating platelet recruitment thrombus growth collagen. Previous work utilizing animal bleeding times supports conclusion; present study demonstrates role dependent upon endothelial vasoconstrictive effects. Intraplatelet cAMP levels raised respect controls upon exposure ATP 8.3 microM (p less 0.025), 15 microM (p less 0.005), well AMP-PCP 42-500 microM (p less 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
