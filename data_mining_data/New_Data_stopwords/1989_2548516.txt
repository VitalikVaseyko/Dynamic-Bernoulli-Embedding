 effect Ca2+-homopantothenate (HOPA) treatment (250 mg/kg 5 d) studied evaluating specific activity enzymes related to: glycolytic pathway (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), tricarboxylic acid cycle (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase), mitochondrial electron transfer chain (succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase), NADH redox state (NADH cytochrome c reductase), acetylcholine metabolism (acetylcholinesterase), glutamate metabolism (glutamate dehydrogenase). enzymatic activity assays performed homogenate toto, nonsynaptic mitochondria synaptosomes isolated from: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, cerebellum normoxic rats rats submitted intermittent normobaric hypoxia (90:10, N2:O2). normoxic rats, HOPA unable induce modification. Hypoxia per se induced decrease activity synaptosomal cytochrome oxidase cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum.
