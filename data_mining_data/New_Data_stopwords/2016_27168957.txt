 Background. Emerging research revealed essential role mitochondria regulating stem/progenitor cell differentiation neural progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells stem cells reactive oxygen species (ROS), Notch signaling pathway. Inhibition mitochondrial protein synthesis results hair loss upon injury. However, alteration mitochondrial morphology metabolic function hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) differentiation affect hair regeneration elaborated upon. Methods. compared difference mitochondrial morphology activity telogen bulge cells anagen matrix cells. Expression levels mitochondrial ROS superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) measured evaluate redox balance. addition, level pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) estimated present change energetic metabolism differentiation. explore effect mitochondrial metabolism regulating hair regeneration, hair growth observed application mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor upon hair plucking. Results. HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria became elongated abundant organized cristae showed higher activity differentiated cells. SOD2 enhanced redox balance relatively stable ROS levels differentiated cells. PDK increased HFSCs differentiated cells showed enhanced PDH, indicating respiration switched glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation differentiation. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration differentiated hair follicle cells upon hair plucking repressed hair regeneration vivo. Conclusions. Upon HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria elongated abundant cristae show higher activity, accompanying activated aerobic respiration differentiated cells higher energy supply. Also, dysfunction mitochondrial respiration delays hair regeneration upon injury.
