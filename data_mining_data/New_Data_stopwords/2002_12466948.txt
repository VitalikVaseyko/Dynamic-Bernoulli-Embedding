 Activation either calcineurin extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway increases percentage slow fibres vivo suggesting pathways regulate fibre phenotypes skeletal muscle. investigated effect calcineurin blockade cyclosporin mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1/2) blockade U0126 upon myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform mRNA levels activities metabolic enzymes 1 day, 3 days 7 days treatment primary cultures spontaneously twitching rat skeletal muscle. U0126 treatment significantly decreased MHC Ibeta mRNA levels significantly increased MHC IIX, MHC IIB, embryonal MHC perinatal MHC mRNA levels compared control. addition, U0126 treatment significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, hexokinase, malate dehydrogenase beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities control values significant reduction percentage pyruvate dehydrogenase active form also observed. Calcineurin blockade significantly decreased MHC Ibeta embryonal mRNA levels control significantly increased MHC IIX mRNA levels. Significant increases activities lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase control values also seen following cyclosporin treatment. conclusion, results suggest calcineurin upregulates slow-fibre genes suppresses fast-fibre genes. Similarly, ERK1/2 pathway upregulates slow-fibre MHC suppresses fast-fibre MHC isoforms. However, effect enzyme activities fibre-type specific. effect U0126 percentage pyruvate dehydrogenase active form suggests ERK1/2 pathway may also involved regulation phosphorylation state enzyme.
