 Currently, pancreatic cancer fourth cause cancer death. 2013, estimated approximately 38 460 people die pancreatic cancer. Early detection malignant cyst (pancreatic cancer precursor) necessary help prevent late diagnosis tumor. study, characterized glycoproteins nonglycoproteins pooled mucinous (n = 10) nonmucinous (n = 10) pancreatic cyst fluid identify "proteins interest" differentiate mucinous cyst nonmucinous cyst investigate proteins potential biomarker targets. automated multilectin affinity chromatography (M-LAC) platform utilized glycoprotein enrichment followed nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Spectral count quantitation allowed identification proteins significant differential levels mucinous cysts nonmucinous cysts one protein (periostin) confirmed via immunoblotting. exhaustively evaluate differentially expressed proteins, used number proteomic tools including gene ontology classification, pathway network analysis, Novoseek data mining, chromosome gene mapping. Utilization complementary proteomic tools revealed several proteins mucin 6 (MUC6), bile salt-activated lipase (CEL), pyruvate kinase lysozyme M1/M2 significant differential expression strong association pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, chromosome gene mapping demonstrated coexpressions colocalization proteins interest including 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE), pigment epithelium derived factor (SERPINF1), oncogene p53.
