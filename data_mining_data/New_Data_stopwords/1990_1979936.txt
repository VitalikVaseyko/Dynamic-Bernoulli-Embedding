 effect di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-initiated preneoplastic liver lesions expression gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTase) loss adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) well alterations hepatic carbohydrate metabolism male female Sprague-Dawley rats investigated. Two treatment schedules compared respect sensitivity histochemical demonstration preneoplastic islands biochemical determination alterations enzyme activities liver homogenates serum, last indicating hepatotoxicity. initiation, single dose DEN given, followed treatment various doses DEHP given three times weekly gavage 7 11 consecutive weeks. histochemical enzyme markers, expression positive GGTase well deficiency ATPase used identification liver foci. weanling female rats (protocol A) found sensitive carcinogenic effect DEN view foci incidence mature male rats underwent partial hepatectomy prior DEN application. administration 200 mg DEHP/kg body wt increased incidence ATPase-deficient foci male female rats; however, concentrations 1000 2000 mg DEHP/kg decreased incidence liver foci. number foci expression GGTase slightly increased female rats following DEHP concentration 50 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg body wt. DEHP alone induce preneoplastic lesions could identified two markers. Biochemical investigations indicate DEHP alters metabolic pattern liver. increase NADP-linked enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme, extra-mitochondrial ICDH well enhancement NAD-dependent alpha-G3PDH lactate dehydrogenase found following DEHP administration. hand glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) enolase well gluconeogenetic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) significantly reduced. protocol B (male rats) reactions PK, FBPase malic enzyme altered DEHP exposure protocol A, activity G6PDH increased protocol A. enzymes involved carbohydrate metabolism influenced DEHP dose-dependent manner. increase serum FBPase activity male female rats DEHP treatment reduction glutamate-oxalate-transaminase glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase activities observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
