 Several recent insights roles mitochondria cancer renewed efforts develop nongenotoxic therapies targeting mitochondrial proteins functions. Mitochondria central hubs intrinsic apoptotic pathways activated cellular stress injury, consequence, cancers often defects pathways. Bcl-2, first identified regulator apoptotic cell deaths, discovered oncogene human cancers. BCL-2 inhibits mitochondrial pathways apoptosis local effects mitochondrial endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Increased expression BCL-2 related antiapoptotic proteins BCL-X(L), MCL-1, BCL-W occurs significant subsets common cancer types (Table I) generally correlated poor response. Although incomplete, emerging understanding BCL-2 functions structural, biochemical, organelle physiology studies provided paths targeting BCL-2 small molecules. Cancer cells also exhibit metabolic differences normal cell counterparts, including aerobic glycolysis, known Warburg effect, mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization, unusual dependence nutrient substrates glucose glutamine. knowledge prompted reexamination potential cancer selectivity previously identified mitochondriotoxic compounds, including approved drugs indications, screening programs identify new compounds mitochondrial activities.
