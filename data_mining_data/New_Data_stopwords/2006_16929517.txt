 Proliferating cells, particularly tumor cells, express dimeric isoenzyme pyruvate kinase, termed M2-PK. direct target several oncoproteins; determination fecal tumor pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK) might another promising tool colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. study, evaluated fecal M2-PK screening biomarker colorectal neoplasia. compared fecal occult blood (FOB) colonoscopy. Three hundred seventeen consecutive subjects 4 different centers included. Stool specimens collected purgation, processed appropriately tested FOB quantitatively analyzed M2-PK. Colonoscopies performed experienced endoscopists unaware fecal assay results. cutoff value 4 U/ml, fecal M2-PK assay sensitivity, specificity, PPV NPV 81.1, 86.7, 71.1 61.9% respectively diagnosing CRC whereas FOBT showed sensitivity 36.5%, specificity 92.2%, PPV 72.9% NPV 71.5% CRC. low specificity fecal M2-PK lead unacceptably high number false positives used mass CRC screening, leading unindicated colonoscopies associated inconveniences, risks costs. CRC screening test must high specificity; high sensitivity vital. conclude, M2-PK found poor screening biomarker CR neoplasia subject population average risk based prospective comparison colonoscopy. marginal performance characteristics permit use screening tool CR neoplasia present clinical settings.
