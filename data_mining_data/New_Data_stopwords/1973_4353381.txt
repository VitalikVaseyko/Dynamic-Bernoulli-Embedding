 1. effects Ca(2+) activities regulatory properties trehalase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose diphosphatase pyruvate kinase vertebrate red white muscle insect fibrillar non-fibrillar muscle investigated. muscles selected possible difference role glycolysis energy production vertebrate muscles, possible difference role Ca(2+) control contraction two types insect muscle. increase Ca(2+) concentration 0.001mum 10mum modify activities modify regulatory properties enzymes various muscles. 2. Concentrations Ca(2+) 0.1mm inhibited activities hexokinase phosphofructokinase different muscles. suggested inhibition may provide basis theory regulation glycolysis (Margreth et al., 1967). phosphofructokinase located within sarcoplasmic reticulum, activity inhibited muscle rest, release Ca(2+) reticulum contraction lead stimulation activity hence increase glycolytic flux. distribution hexokinase phosphofructokinase various cell fractions muscles variable. particular, enzymes present almost exclusively 100000g supernatant fraction extracts insect flight muscles. Thus correlation properties enzymes distribution muscle. 3. concluded Ca(2+) control activities important regulatory enzymes glycolysis muscle. suggested muscles sensitivity control mechanism level phosphofructokinase changes concentration AMP may increased process known ;substrate-cycling'.
