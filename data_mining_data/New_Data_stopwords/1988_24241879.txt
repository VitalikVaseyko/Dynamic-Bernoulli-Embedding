 Negatively charged large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) incubated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. xanthi) cell suspensions cell-free medium cell suspensions. extent cell-LUV interaction determined leakage LUV contents. Cells enhanced leakage LUV contents effect increased cell age. Addition polylysine reaction mixture increased even leakage LUV contents. cell-free medium cell suspension also affected integrity LUV. Cell-free medium, itself, promoted leakage LUV contents caused reduction leakage exerted polylysine. Centrifugation (8000g) cell-free medium decreased effect, heat treatment (122 degrees C) alter effect sonication enhanced it. effects cell-free medium attributed presence cell wall debris disintegrated cells.
