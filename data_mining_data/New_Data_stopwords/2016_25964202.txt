 Tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) serious clinical challenge significantly limits effectiveness cytotoxic chemotherapy. such, complementary therapeutic strategies explored prevent relapse. altered metabolic state cancer cells, perform aerobic glycolysis, represents interesting target enable discrimination healthy cells cancer cells. hypothesized cosilencing genes responsible aerobic glycolysis MDR would synergistic antitumor effect. study, siRNA duplexes pyruvate kinase M2 multidrug resistance gene-1 encapsulated hyaluronic acid-based self-assembling nanoparticles. particles characterized morphology, size, charge, encapsulation efficiency, transfection efficiency. vivo studies included biodistribution assessment, gene knockdown confirmation, therapeutic efficacy, safety analysis. benefit active targeting cancer cells confirmed modifying particles' surface peptide targeted epidermal growth factor receptor, overexpressed membranes SKOV-3 cancer cells. augment studies involving transplantation paclitaxel-resistant cell line, vivo paclitaxel resistance model developed injecting repeated doses paclitaxel following tumor inoculation. nanoparticles accumulated significantly tumors, hindering tumor volume doubling time (P < 0.05) upon combination therapy wild-type (2-fold) resistant (8-fold) xenograft models. Although previous studies indicated silencing MDR-1 alone sensitized MDR ovarian cancer paclitaxel modestly, data suggest concurrent silencing PKM-2 improves efficacy paclitaxel MDR ovarian cancer.
