 Altered levels functions microRNAs (miRs) associated carcinogenesis. study, investigated role miR-124 colorectal adenoma (CRA) cancer (CRC). expression levels miR-124 decreased CRA (81.8%) CRC (57.6%) 55 clinical samples. ectopic expression miR-124 induced apoptosis autophagy colon cancer cells. Also, miR-124 targeted polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1), splicer pyruvate kinase muscles 1 2 (PKM1 PKM2) induced switching PKM isoform expression PKM2 PKM1. Also, siR-PTB1 induced drastic apoptosis colon cancer cells. Furthermore, found ectopic expression miR-124 enhanced oxidative stress miR-124/PTB1/PKM1/PKM2 axis constituted feedback cascade. Finally, showed intratumor injection miR-124 siR-PTB1 induced tumor-suppressive effect xenografted mice. axis established vitro vivo experiments function human colorectal cancer cells. findings suggest miR-124 acts tumor-suppressor modulator energy metabolism PTB1/PKM1/PKM2 feedback cascade human colorectal tumor cells.
