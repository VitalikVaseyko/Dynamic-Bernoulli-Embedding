 Cancer cells mainly metabolize glycolysis (the Warburg effect) better adapted resist metabolic stress. Metastasis-associated colon cancer-1 (MACC1) oncogene promoting gastric cancer (GC) growth metastasis, expression positively correlates GC progression. However, unknown MACC1 elevates GC progression role cancer metabolism. study, discovered MACC1 expression significantly upregulated via adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling response glucose deprivation-induced metabolic stress. Clinical observation demonstrates MACC1 expression higher advanced stage GC. MACC1 expression proved positively correlated maximum standardized uptake value (18)F-deoxyglucose patients, MACC1 enhanced (18)F-deoxyglucose uptake GC cells xenografts. underlying mechanism MACC1 promoted Warburg effect upregulating activities expressions series glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lactate dehydrogenase, GC cells. metabolic shift enhanced cell viability resistance apoptosis facilitating ATP generation, reducing reactive oxygen species production stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential. contrast, MACC1-silenced Warburg effect-blocked GC cells vulnerable metabolic stress. conclusion, metabolic stress one mechanisms elevate MACC1 expression GC, MACC1 upregulation compensatively ensures GC growth metabolic stress facilitating Warburg effect.
