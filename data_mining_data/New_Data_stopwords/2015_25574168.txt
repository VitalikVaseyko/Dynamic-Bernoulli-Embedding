 Exemplified cancer cells' preference glycolysis, example, Warburg effect, altered metabolism tumorigenesis emerged important aspect cancer past 10-20 years. Whether due changes regulatory tumor suppressors/oncogenes acting metabolic oncogenes themselves, enzymes involved complex network metabolic pathways studied understand role assess utility therapeutic targets. Conversion glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate phosphohydroxypyruvate enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)-a rate-limiting step conversion 3-phosphoglycerate serine-represents one mechanism. Forgotten since classic animal studies 1980s, role PHGDH potential therapeutic target putative metabolic oncogene recently reemerged following publication two prominent papers near-simultaneously 2011. Since time, numerous studies host metabolic explanations put forward attempt understand results observed. paper, review historic progression understanding role PHGDH cancer early work Snell reemergence rise prominence, culminating assessment subsequent work means future PHGDH.
