 Aberrant expression epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) present many human tumors. Several reports shown EGFR translocated nucleus liver regeneration several types cells tissues placenta thyroid. Nuclear EGFR associated transcription, DNA synthesis, DNA repair activity serves prognostic marker breast carcinoma oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer. However, nuclear localization sequence (NLS) EGFR extensively examined. study, shown juxtamembrane region EGFR harbors putative NLS three clusters basic amino acids (RRRHIVRKRTLRR (amino acids 645-657)) mediates nuclear localization EGFR. found newly characterized tripartite NLS conserved among EGFR family members (EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4) able move nucleus. Further, tripartite NLS could also mediate nuclear localization known cytoplasmic proteins pyruvate kinase. demonstrated mutating one three basic amino acid clusters (R K --> A) leads significant impairment nuclear localization EGFR green fluorescent protein-pyruvate kinase-NLS reporter protein. results show tripartite NLS distinct traditional mono- bipartite NLS reveal mechanism could account nuclear localization membrane receptors.
