 purpose study examine effects lactate, protons, inorganic phosphate, ATP myofibrillar ATPase activity. Myofibrils isolated carp (Cyprinius carpio L.) fast-twitch white muscle, myofibrillar ATPase activities assessed maximal activating calcium levels (pCa 4.0) 10 degrees C reaction media containing metabolic profiles similar seen fatiguing muscles. Ca(2+)-activated ATPase activity assessed ATP regenerating assay coupled myofibrillar ATPase pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. assay allowed effects ATP, inorganic phosphate, protons, lactate myofibrillar ATPase activity assessed. coupled assay found give similar myofibrillar ATPase kinetics, exception higher maximal activities, seen standard end-point assay. Myofibrillar ATPase activity depressed 35% ATP concentrations lowered 2.5 mM. Lowering ATP levels 0.5 mM reduced myofibrillar ATPase activities 85%. Lactate effect myofibrillar ATPase activities. Inorganic phosphate levels 20 mM significantly decreased myofibrillar ATPase activities, increases inorganic phosphate content minimal effects. changes ATPase activities related total inorganic phosphate, content diprotonated inorganic phosphate. Myofibrillar ATPase activity highest pH 7.5 lowest pH 6.0. interactive effects low ATP, decreased pH, high inorganic phosphate levels additive, giving similar decreases activity produced increased inorganic phosphate levels alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
