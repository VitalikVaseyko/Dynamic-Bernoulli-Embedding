 effects isoprenaline administration (300 micrograms/kg 5 weeks) rat soleus muscle capillarity glycolytic oxidative capacities evaluated. treatment resulted ventricular hypertrophy. activities lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, cytochrome c oxidase soleus muscle homogenates different control isoprenaline-injected animals. Capillaries visualized muscle cross sections treated demonstrate ATPase activity acid preincubation. Capillary density higher experimental (873 +/- 38 capillaries/mm2) control (713 +/- 33 capillaries/mm2) animals. Capillary fiber ratio also higher experimental (2.47 +/- 0.10) control (2.09 +/- 0.08) animals, fiber cross-sectional area changed treatment (2836 +/- 87 microns2 controls 2951 +/- 136 microns2 experimental). plot capillary fiber ratio vs. fiber cross-sectional area showed given fiber cross-sectional area value capillary fiber ratio treated animals higher controls. indicates treatment resulted proliferation microvessels. results suggest prolonged beta-adrenergic stimulation results development new capillaries accompanied increases oxidative capacity soleus muscle rat.
