 objectives present study explore role pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (PKM2) progression Kazakh's esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) Xinjiang, China, clarify mechanism PKM2 malignant phenotype. PKM2 expression examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) 101 matched pairs ESCC normal adjacent tissues (NATs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 35 serum samples Kazakh's ESCC 8 serum samples healthy subjects. investigate mechanism, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-PKM2 transfected ESCC cells. Cell migration invasion evaluated wound healing Transwell assays. Apoptosis cell cycle analyzed flow cytometry (FCM). PKM2 expression significantly higher ESCC tissues (77.2 %, 78/101) compared matched NAT (P = 0.003) also higher serum samples Kazakh's ESCC patients (78.84 ng/mL) compared healthy subjects (13.55 ng/mL) (P = 0.001). Patients overexpression PKM2 poor prognosis (P = 0.032). knockdown PKM2, cell proliferation, migration, invasion significantly reduced (P = 0.001), apoptosis increased (P = 0.001), cell cycle arrested G1 phase. PKM2 overexpression significantly correlated worse outcome Kazakh's ESCC. Furthermore, PKM2 involved progression ESCC promoting proliferation suppressing apoptosis, accelerating invasion, influencing cell cycle. PKM2 could potential biomarker molecular classification ESCC.
