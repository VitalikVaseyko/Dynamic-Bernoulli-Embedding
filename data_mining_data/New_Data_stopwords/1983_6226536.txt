 Energized submitochondrial particles subjected high low [3H]ATP/[3H]ADP ratios, maintained steady state pyruvate kinase hexokinase regenerating system, respectively. steady state conditions, 1.4 mol [3H]nucleotide/mol ATPase retained considerably [3H]ATP retained high [3H]ATP/[3H]ADP ratio. ATPase activity oxygen exchange differentially labeled SMP same, suggesting lack control function non-catalytic tightly bound nucleotides.
