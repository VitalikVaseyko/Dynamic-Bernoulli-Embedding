 Cell differentiation leads adaptive changes energy metabolism. Conversely, hyperglycemia induces malfunction many body systems, including bone, suggesting energy metabolism reciprocally affects cell differentiation. investigated differentiation bone-resorbing osteoclasts, large polykaryons formed fusion growth cells monocytic origin, affected excess energy substrate pyruvate energy metabolism changes osteoclast differentiation. Surprisingly, small increases pyruvate (1-2 mM basal levels) augmented osteoclastogenesis vitro vivo, larger increases effective vitro. Osteoclast differentiation increased cell mitochondrial activity ATP levels, augmented energy-rich conditions. Conversely, inhibition respiration significantly reduced osteoclast number size. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts metabolic sensor, inhibited energy-rich conditions. found osteoclast differentiation associated increase AMPK levels change AMPK isoform composition. Increased osteoclast size induced pyruvate (1 mM basal levels) prevented presence AMPK activator 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR). keeping, inhibition AMPK using dorsomorphin siRNA AMPKgamma increased osteoclast size control cultures level observed presence pyruvate. Thus, found moderate excess pyruvate enhances osteoclastogenesis, AMPK acts tailor osteoclastogenesis cell's bioenergetics capacity.
