 Escherichia coli, disruption ptsG, encodes glucose-specific permease phosphotransferase transport system (PTS) protein EIICB(Glc), crucial high succinate production. mutation can, however, cause slow growth low glucose consumption rates. ptsG mutant (TUQ2), wild type E. coli W1485, E. coli galP (encoding galactose permease) glk (encoding glucose kinase) gene expression plasmids constructed. TUQ2 increased generation time approximately 4 h gave higher final cell density 0.5 g/l expression galP. However, glk expression effect mutant. expression pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) galactose permease, ptsG mutant showed higher succinate yield (1.2 mol/mol glucose) specific rate glucose consumption 0.33 0.6 g/1 h.
