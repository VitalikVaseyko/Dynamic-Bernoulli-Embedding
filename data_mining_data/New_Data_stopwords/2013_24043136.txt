 PURPOSE: Capecitabine one chemotherapy drugs high oral availability. Recently, sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) shown great potential anticancer agent. present study, assessed anticancer effect DCA combination capecitabine cancers modestly expressed TP. METHODS: mouse B16 melanoma allograft human non-small cell lung cancer A549 xenograft used assess effect DCA capecitabine combined treatment. Histology immunohistochemistry used detect apoptosis proliferation cancer cells. Real-time PCR Western blot carried detect expression TP caspases, respectively. RESULTS: first time, report DCA increased antitumor effects capecitabine mouse B16 allograft human A549 xenograft promoting apoptosis tumor cells. DCA little effect expression TP. CONCLUSIONS: finding suggests DCA combination capecitabine might potential new therapeutic regimen cancers.
