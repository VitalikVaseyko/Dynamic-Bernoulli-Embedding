 BACKGROUND: L-tyrosine common precursor wide range valuable secondary metabolites, including benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) many polyketides. industrially tractable yeast strain optimized production L-tyrosine could serve platform development BIA polyketide cell factories. study applied targeted metabolomics approach evaluate metabolic engineering strategies increase availability intracellular L-tyrosine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK. engineering strategies combined localized pathway engineering global engineering central metabolism, facilitated genome-scale steady-state modelling. RESULTS: Addition tyrosine feedback resistant version 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase Aro4 S. cerevisiae combined overexpression either tyrosine feedback resistant yeast chorismate mutase Aro7, native pentafunctional arom protein Aro1, native prephenate dehydrogenase Tyr1 cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase TyrC Zymomonas mobilis. Loss aromatic carbon limited eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase Aro10. TAL gene Rhodobacter sphaeroides used produce coumarate simple test case heterologous by-product tyrosine. Additionally, multiple strategies engineering global metabolism promote tyrosine production evaluated using metabolic modelling. T21E mutant pyruvate kinase Cdc19 hypothesized slow conversion phosphoenolpyruvate pyruvate accumulate former precursor shikimate pathway. ZWF1 gene coding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deleted create NADPH deficiency designed force cell couple growth tyrosine production via overexpressed NADP(+)-dependent prephenate dehydrogenase Tyr1. engineered Zwf1(-) strain expressing TYRC ARO4(FBR) grown presence methionine achieved intracellular L-tyrosine accumulation 520 mumol/g DCW 192 mM cytosol, sustained flux pathway found depend complete elimination feedback inhibition degradation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: targeted metabolomics approach confirmed likely regulatory site DAHP synthase identified another possible cofactor limitation prephenate dehydrogenase. Additionally, genome-scale metabolic model identified design strategies potential improve availability erythrose 4-phosphate DAHP synthase cofactor availability prephenate dehydrogenase. evaluated strategies provide recommendations improvement aromatic amino acid biosynthesis S. cerevisiae.
