 glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, enolase phosphoglyceromutase) immobilized polyacrylamide-type bead polymer containing carboxylic functional groups activated water-soluble carbodiimide. immobilized enzymes used determination pyruvic acid, phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 2-phosphoglyceric acid 3-phosphoglyceric acid flow injection system. immobilized lactate dehydrogenase column repeatedly employed determination pyruvic acid clinical samples. results flow injection method accorded well accuracy, sensitivity reproducibility soluble enzyme analysis.
