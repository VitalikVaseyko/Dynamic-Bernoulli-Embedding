 Kinetic evidence time- dose-dependent inactivation phosphofructokinase glucagon isolated rat hepatocytes reported. inactivation, persists gel filtration cell-free extract Sephadex G-25 400-fold purification enzyme agarose-ATP, observed enzyme activity measured subsaturating concentrations fructose 6-phosphate, change Vmax. Phosphofructokinase inactivation glucagon parallels known inactivation pyruvate kinase L activation glycogen phosphorylase alpha. Exogenous cyclic AMP mimics effect hormone. Half-maximal effect phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase L caused similar dose glucagon (1 x 10(-10) M). inactivation phosphofructokinase nonsaturating concentration glucagon reversed spontaneously within 40 min incubation reversion accelerated insulin.
