 Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides widely used clinical studies rational sequence-specific gene silencing. However, several sequence-unspecific off-target effects recently described compound class. contrast siRNA-mediated knockdown gene, bcl-2-targeted oblimersen (Genasense, G3139) downregulates number proteins involved apoptotic resistance several glycolytic enzymes 607B human melanoma cells. Regardless target, phosphorothioate-modified antisense siRNA compounds, oligonucleotides phosphodiester backbone, resulted similar impact proteome. Unspecifically downregulated proteins include cancer markers involved apoptotic resistance endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP 78), protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3, GRP 58), calumenin, galectin-1, well glycolytic enzymes triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase. depletion glycolytic enzymes reflected decrease L-lactate production, indicating partial reversal Warburg effect. Compared phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, oblimersen generally led pronounced effect terms number influenced proteins extent downregulation, suggesting synergistic effect Bcl-2 downregulation.
