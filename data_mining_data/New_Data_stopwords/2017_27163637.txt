 Oxidative stress (OS) plays crucial role development myocardial disease, induce dysfunction cardiac muscle cells. 3,3',5-triiodothyroxine (T3) hormone secreted thyroid gland shown protect cells improving redox state regulate expression pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM, including two isoforms PKM1 PKM2). present study aimed reveal key effects T3 protecting human myocardial cell lines oxidative stress downstream molecular mechanism. oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion model (OGDR) three subtypes deiodinase family (DIO1, DIO2, DIO3), convert thyroxine (T4) T3, tested model. results show expression DIO1, DIO2 T3 downregulated, DIO3 upregulated OGDR-treated AC16 HCM-a cells. Then, OGDR-treated cells treated T3 T4. results show T3 inhibited expression reactive oxygen species (ROS) malonic dialdehyde (MDA), upregulated glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) superoxide dismutase (SOD). effects T4 notable. T3 also protected OGDR cells apoptosis upregulated PKM2/PKM1 ratio. mechanistic studies found PKM2 inhibition small interfering RNA (siRNA) could attenuate anti-OS anti-apoptotic effects T3. findings suggest T3 inhibit apoptosis oxidative stress OGDR-treated AC16 HCM-a cells regulating PKM2/PKM1 ratio.
