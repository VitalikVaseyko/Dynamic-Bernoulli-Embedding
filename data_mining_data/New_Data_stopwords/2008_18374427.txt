 Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including natural estrogens estrogenic chemicals, almost ubiquitous aquatic environment. marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis different estrogenic compounds, individually mixtures, shown affect immune function vitro vivo. Moreover, individual estrogens, natural estrogen 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) xenoestrogen bisphenol (BPA), recently demonstrated alter functional parameters gene expression mussel digestive gland, tissue plays central role metabolism nutrient distribution gonad gamete maturation, possible consequences gametogenesis. work, possible effects synthetic mixture EDCs digestive gland evaluated. mixture contained seven estrogenic chemicals (17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol, mestranol (MES), nonylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate carboxylate (NP1EC), BPA, benzophenone (BP)), proportions similar previously found water samples coastal lagoon. Mussels injected different concentrations mixture (approximate nominal concentrations total EDCs: 0.0177, 0.177, 1.77 177 ng/g dw) tissues sampled 24 h post-injection. mixture induced significant changes lysosomal biomarkers (lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), neutral lipid (NL) lipofuscin (LF) accumulation) well activities catalase, glutathione transferase (GST), glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK). Moreover, downregulation gene transcription Mytilus estrogen receptor MeER1 isoform catalase, evaluated quantitative RT-PCR, observed. Significant changes lysosomal biomarkers, enzyme activities gene transcription also recorded 72 h post-injection. results demonstrate short-term exposure environmentally relevant concentrations EDC mixtures interfere lysosomal function, redox-related enzyme activities gene transcription mussel digestive gland.
