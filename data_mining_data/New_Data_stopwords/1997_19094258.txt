However, studies unable control large number sociobehavioural confounders might responsible apparent effect parity body weight. Longitudinal studies examine changes maternal body weight regnancy avoid problems using mother control. Nevertheless, studies overcome three methodological constraints: must obtain accurate measure prepregnant body weight, must give mother sufficient time lose weight retained following delivery, must take account effect ageing maternal weight gain pregnancy follow-up period. 90% studies reviewed found body weight greater pregnancy (by 0.2-10.6 kg). previous researchers examined evidence pregnancy-related weight gains suggest body weight increases average 04-4.8 kg following pregnancy. However, three 71 longitudinal studies examined present review complied three methodological criteria. studies concluded mothers gain, average, 0.9-3.3 kg weight following pregnancy nonpregnant controls, mean body weight remained 0.4-3.0 kg higher, even controlling number sociobehavioural confounders. apparently modest increase mean maternal body weight women one two children conceals fact mothers experience substantial increase body weight become obese following pregnancy. remains unclear whether increases simply result changes energy metabolism pregnancy lactation, whether influenced inherent changes lifestyle accompany pregnancy motherhood.
