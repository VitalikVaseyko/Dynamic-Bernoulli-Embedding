 previously observed downregulation mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-related protein, TMEM70, suggestive disrupted cellular senescence, GST-P-expressing (+) proliferative lesions early hepatocarcinogenesis stages rats. present study investigated immunohistochemical relationship TMEM70 downregulation cellular metabolic changes carcinogenic processes, well onset liver cell respiratory changes repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment rats. early hepatocarcinogenesis stage 2-stage model, GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions showing TMEM70 downregulation also downregulated mitochondrial ATPase, ATPB, upregulated glycolysis-related glucose transporter member 1 (GLUT1) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis, known Warburg effect. Combined downregulation TMEM70 ATPB increased proliferation activity GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions, suggesting cell proliferation facilitation reducing mitochondrial respiration. Concurrent GLUT1-upregulation TMEM70-downregulation increased nuclear phosphorylated c-MYC+ cells GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions, suggesting c-MYC-mediated transcription facilitation promote glycolysis cell proliferation. TMEM70-related metabolic shift enhanced GST-P+ neoplastic lesions, suggesting contribution tumor progression. Conversely, TMEM70-related metabolic shift lacking peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, well carcinogenic processes targeting organs. Transcript expression analysis following 28- 90-day repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment showed downregulation Tmem70 day 28 upregulation Pkm Myc day 90, suggesting early onset catastrophic cellular senescence-related metabolic shift beginning depressed mitochondrial respiration liver. results suggest contribution TMEM70 downregulation Warburg effect, directs tumor promotion progression GST-P+-linked hepatocarcinogenesis rats.
