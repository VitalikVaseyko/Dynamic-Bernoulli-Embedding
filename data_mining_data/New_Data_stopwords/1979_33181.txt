 new spin-labeled derivative ADP, 2-(4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)thioadenosine-5'-diphosphate, synthesized. compound causes reversible irreversible phases aggregation human blood platelets concentrations similar required similar phases aggregation ADP itself. spin-labeled ADP also rivals ADP substrate pyruvate kinase. interaction intact human blood platelets isolated platelet membranes platelet-aggregating spin-labeled derivatives ADP studied. dramatic decrease ESR signal spin label primarily due chemical reduction nitroxide, rather immobilization label. platelets spin-labeled ADP mixed, rapid burst nitroxide reduction occurs, followed much slower reduction similar time course seen spin labels. rapid burst reduction, slow reduction, inhibited adenosine, inhibitor ADP-induced platelet aggregation, sulfhydryl-blocking agents. Experiments conducted Ellman's reagent platelet membranes washed platelets revealed 10 30% increase number reactive membrane sulfhydryl groups ADP present. results indicate increase number reactive sulfhydryl groups platelet surface platelets membranes stimulated ADP.
