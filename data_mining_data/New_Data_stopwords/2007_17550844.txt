 BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell pyruvate kinase (R-PK) deficiency common glycolytic enzyme defect associated hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Cases severe deficiency die peri- neonatal period specific therapy exists present. test whether targeted overexpression normal R-PK gene erythroid cells could reduce hemolysis R-PK mutant mice, performed genetic rescue study using human R-PK transgenic mice. DESIGN METHODS: Human R-PK promoter driven human mLCR human b-globin locus used erythroid-specific expression human R-PK murine erythrocytes. transgenic lines mated homozygous R-PK mutant mice subsequently backcrossed. Mutant homozygotes mLCR-R-PK transgene examined therapeutic effects transgene expression. RESULTS: Two PK transgenic lines, hRPK_lo hRPK_hi, obtained. R-PK activity transgenic mice reached high three times animals endogenous PK gene. Overexpression human R-PK homozygous mutant mice successfully reduced hemolytic anemia. Improvements hemolysis evaluated hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count, spleen weight, showed significant correlations levels expression transgene. Recovery metabolic disturbance mutant red blood cells shown normalized concentrations glycolytic intermediates upstream PK. addition, remarkable negative correlation R-PK activity number TUNEL-positive erythroid progenitors spleen. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSIONS: results indicate overexpression wild-type PK gene mutant erythroid cells ameliorates erythroid apoptosis shortened red blood cell lifespan observed PK mutant mice. likely level transgene expression required achieve evident therapeutic effects equivalent endogenous PK gene. gene-addition strategy may suitable clinical application high level transgene expression R-PK erythroid progenitors/red blood cells.
