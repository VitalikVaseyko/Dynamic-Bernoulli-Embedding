 Transcription L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene induced glucose presence insulin repressed glucagon via cyclic AMP. DNA regulatory sequence responsible mediating glucose cyclic AMP responses, called glucose response element (GlRE), consists two degenerated E boxes spaced 5 base pairs able bind basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper proteins, particular upstream stimulatory factors (USFs). ex vivo vivo experiments, appears USFs required correct response L-PK gene glucose, expression binding activity known regulated glucose. genetic screen yeast allowed us identify novel transcriptional factor binding GlRE, i.e. chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). Binding COUP-TFII GlRE confirmed electrophoretic mobility shift assays, COUP-TFII-containing complexes detectable liver nuclear extracts. Neither abundance binding activity COUP-TFII appeared significantly regulated diets. footprinting experiments, two COUP-TFII-binding sites overlapping E boxes detected. Overexpression COUP-TFII abrogated USF-dependent transactivation artificial GlRE-dependent promoter COS cells glucose responsiveness L-PK promoter hepatocytes primary culture. addition, mutated GlRE increased affinity USF low affinity COUP-TFII conferred dramatically decreased glucose responsiveness L-PK promoter hepatocytes primary culture increasing activity reporter gene low glucose condition. propose COUP-TFII could negative regulatory component glucose sensor complex assembled GlRE L-PK gene likely glucose-responsive genes well.
