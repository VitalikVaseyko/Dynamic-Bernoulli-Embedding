 Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activator protein 1 transcription factors involved regulation cell proliferation play important roles tumorigenesis. investigated whether two factors cooperate transcriptional regulation cyclin D1 (CCND1), gene whose deregulation critical carcinogenesis. demonstrate overexpression JunD human hepatocarcinoma cells strongly activates transcription mediated kappaB2 site CCND1 promoter reporter assays, manner strictly dependent presence NF-kappaB proteins. Serum stimulation increased expression p65, p50, c-Fos, c-Jun JunD induced recruitment p65, p50 JunD kappaB2 site promoter DNA pull-down assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed serum-induced recruitment JunD promoter vivo showed presence JunD dependent presence p65 p50, indicating protein-protein-dependent mechanism JunD recruitment. Serum-induced activation protein binding kappaB2 correlated high levels phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) phosphorylation. LY294002, specific inhibitor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), overexpression dominant-negative form PDK-1 inhibited JunD-stimulating effect reporter assays. LY294002 also prevented serum-induced recruitment JunD, p65 p50 promoter ChIP assay. JunD-p65 complexes, identified vivo co-immunoprecipitation, decreased LY294002 small interfering RNA inhibition PDK-1. Taken together, data demonstrate PI3K/PDK-1-dependent functional cooperation NF-kappaB JunD transcriptional regulation CCND1 serum.
