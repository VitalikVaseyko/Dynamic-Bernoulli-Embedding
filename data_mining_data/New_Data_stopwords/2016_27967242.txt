 Androgen excess women associated metabolic dysfunction (e.g., obesity, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, increased risk type 2 diabetes) reproductive dysfunction (e.g., polycystic ovaries, amenorrhea, dysregulated gonadotropin release, infertility). sought identify effects androgen excess glucose metabolic dysfunction specific mechanisms action androgens inducing pathology. developed mouse model displayed pathophysiological serum androgen levels normal body mass/composition ensure phenotypes directly androgens indirect consequence obesity. performed reproductive tests, metabolic tests, hormonal assays. Livers isolated examined via molecular, biochemical, histological analysis. Additionally, low-dose dihydrotestosterone (DHT) cell model using H2.35 mouse hepatocytes developed study androgen effects hepatic insulin signaling. DHT mice demonstrated impaired estrous cyclicity; corpora lutea ovaries; glucose, insulin, pyruvate intolerance; lowered hepatic insulin action. Mechanistically, DHT increased hepatic androgen-receptor binding phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-p85, resulting dissociation PI3K-p85 PI3K-p110, leading reduced PI3K activity decreased p-AKT and, thus, lowered insulin action. DHT increased gluconeogenesis via direct transcriptional regulation gluconeogenic enzymes coactivators. hepatocyte model recapitulated vivo findings. DHT-induced hepatocyte insulin resistance reversed androgen-receptor antagonist, flutamide. findings present phenotype (i.e., impaired glucose tolerance disrupted glucose metabolism) lean hyperandrogenemia model (low-dose DHT) data support 2 molecular mechanisms help drive androgen-induced impaired glucose metabolism.
