 hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family transcription factors directs coordinated cellular response hypoxia includes transcriptional regulation number metabolic enzymes. Chuvash polycythemia (CP) autosomal recessive human disorder regulatory degradation HIF impaired, resulting elevated levels HIF normal oxygen tensions. Apart polycythemia, CP patients marked abnormalities cardiopulmonary function. studies integrated metabolic function reported. describe response patients series metabolic stresses: exercise large muscle mass cycle ergometer, exercise small muscle mass (calf muscle) allowed noninvasive vivo assessments muscle metabolism using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, standard meal tolerance test. exercise, CP patients early marked phosphocreatine depletion acidosis skeletal muscle, greater accumulation lactate blood, reduced maximum exercise capacities. Muscle biopsy specimens CP patients showed elevated levels transcript pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phosphofructokinase, muscle pyruvate kinase. cell culture, range experimental manipulations used study effects HIF cellular metabolism. However, approaches provide potential investigate integrated responses level whole organism. Although CP relatively subtle disorder, study reveals striking regulatory role HIF metabolism exercise humans. findings significant implications development therapeutic approaches targeting HIF pathway.
