 Single muscle fibres separated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) well soleus (SOL) Wistar strain male rat relaxing solution typed histochemically, glycolytic oxidative enzyme activities determined fibres. Glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) creatine kinase (CK) showed highest activities fast-twitch glycolytic (FG), lower fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG) lowest slow-twitch oxidative (SO) fibres. Also oxidative enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) showed highest activities SO, lower FOG lowest FG fibres. activities LDH, PFK, PK CK FOG fibres separated EDL showed higher activity compared separated SOL, whereas opposite result obtained activities SDH MDH. Enzyme activities single muscle fibre type distinguishable another type, activity profiles overlapped considerable range. correlations among separate enzyme activities CK, LDH MDH obtained single fibre overlapped considerable range.
