 Human pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) glycolytic enzyme isoform implicated cancer. Malignant cancer cells higher levels dimeric PKM2, regarded inactive form tetrameric pyruvate kinase. perceived inactivity fueled controversy dimeric form pyruvate kinase might contribute cancer. investigate enzymatic properties PKM2(G415R), variant derived cancer patient, show size-exclusion chromatography small-angle X-ray scattering dimer cannot form tetramer solution. Although PKM2(G415R) binds fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), unlike wild type PKM2 variant shows activation FBP. contrast, PKM2(G415R) activated succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose 5'-phosphate (SAICAR), endogenous metabolite previously showed correlates increased level cell proliferation promotes protein kinase activity PKM2. results demonstrate important unexpected enzymatic activity PKM2 dimer likely key role cancer progression.
