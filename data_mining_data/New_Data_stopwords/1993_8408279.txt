 constructed general purpose mammalian expression vector study intracellular protein targeting. vector, p3PK, facilitates construction N- and/or C-terminal fusions amino acid sequence interest normally cytosolic protein chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (CMPK). vector engineered fusion construct subcloned versatile pJx omega family mammalian expression vectors pGEX bacterial expression vectors, generation affinity reagents. paper, demonstrate general utility p3PK redirecting CMPK mitochondria (using twelve amino acid pre-sequence yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV) nucleus (using putative eight amino acid nuclear localization signal human nuclear lamins C). also report that, contrary predictions previously published work, substitution critical residue nuclear lamin A/C nuclear localization signal (the equivalent lysine 128 SV40 large nuclear localization signal) retains nuclear localization, discuss amino acid context might affect targeting nucleus.
