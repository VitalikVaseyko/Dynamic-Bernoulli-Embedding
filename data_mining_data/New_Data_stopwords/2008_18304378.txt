 Tumor cells exhibit altered metabolism, characterized increased glucose uptake elevated glycolysis, first recognized Otto Warburg 70 years ago. Warburg originally hypothesized metabolic changes reflected damage mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Although hypoxia hypoxia inducible factor induce transcriptional changes stimulate glucose transport glycolysis, clear changes occur cultured tumor transformed cells cultured normoxic conditions, thus must genetic alterations independent hypoxia stimulate aerobic glycolysis. recent years become clear loss p53 activation Akt induce part metabolic changes reflected Warburg effect. Likewise, changes expression lactate dehydrogenase glycolytic control enzymes contribute increased altered glycolysis. also clear changes lipid biosynthesis occur tumor cells support increased membrane biosynthesis perhaps altered energy needs cells. Changes fatty acid synthase, Spot 14, Akt, DecR1 (2,4-dienoylcoenzyme reductase) may underlie altered lipid metabolism tumor cells contribute ability tumor cells proliferate metastasize. Although advances provide new therapeutic targets merit exploration, remain critical questions explored mechanistic level; work may yield insights tumor cell biology identify additional therapeutic targets.
