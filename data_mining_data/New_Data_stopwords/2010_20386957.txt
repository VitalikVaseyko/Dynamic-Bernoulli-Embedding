 According "canonical" view, reactive oxygen species (ROS) positively contribute, different ways, carcinogenesis malignant progression tumor cells: drive genomic damage genetic instability, transduce, signaling intermediates, mitogenic survival inputs growth factor receptors adhesion molecules, promote cell motility shape tumor microenvironment inducing inflammation/repair angiogenesis. Chemopreventive tumor-inhibitory effects endogenous, diet-derived supplemented antioxidants largely support notion. However, emerging lines evidence indicates tumor cells also need defend oxidative damage order survive successfully spread distance. "heresy" recently received important impulse studies role antioxidant capacity cancer stem cells self-renewal resistance therapy; additionally, transforming activity oncogenes unexpectedly linked capacity maintain elevated intracellular levels reduced glutathione (GSH), principal redox buffer. studies underline importance cellular antioxidant capacity metastasis, result complex cell program involving enhanced motility profound change energy metabolism. glycolytic switch (Warburg effect) observed malignant tissues triggered mitochondrial oxidative damage and/or activation redox-sensitive transcription factors, results increase cell resistance oxidants. hand, cytoskeleton rearrangement underlying cell motile tumor-aggressive behavior use ROS intermediates therefore facilitated oxidative stress. Along line speculation, suggest metastasis represents integrated strategy cancer cells avoid oxidative damage escape excess ROS primary tumor site, explaning redox signaling pathways often up-regulated malignancy metastasis.
