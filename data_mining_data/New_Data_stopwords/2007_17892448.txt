 Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyses irreversible synthesis pyruvate ATP, used multiple biochemical pathways. compounds essential sustained fatty acid production plastids maturing Arabidopsis embryos. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR approach, three genes encoding putative plastidial PKs (PKps) Arabidopsis, namely PKp1 (At3g22960), PKp2 (At5g52920) PKp3 (At1g32440), shown ubiquitously expressed. However, PKp1 PKp2 exhibited significant expression maturing seeds. activity PKp1 PKp2 promoters consistent pattern, study PKp1:GFP PKp2:GFP fusion proteins confirmed plastidial localization enzymes. investigate function two PKp isoforms seeds comprehensive functional analyses carried out, including cytological, biochemical molecular characterization two pkp1 two pkp2 alleles, together pkp1pkp2 double mutant. results obtained outlined importance PKps fatty acid synthesis embryo development. Mutant seeds depleted oil, fatty acid content drastically modified, embryo elongation retarded and, finally, seed germination also affected. Together, results provide interesting insights concerning carbon fluxes leading oil synthesis maturing Arabidopsis seeds. regulation metabolic network WRINKLED1 transcription factor discussed, emphasizes role plastidial metabolism importance tight regulation.
