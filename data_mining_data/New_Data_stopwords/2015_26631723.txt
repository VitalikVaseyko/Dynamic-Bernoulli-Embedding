 B cell malignancies comprise diverse group cancers proliferate lymph nodes, bone marrow, peripheral blood. SIRT3 (sirtuin 3) major deacetylase within mitochondrial matrix promotes aerobic metabolism controls reactive oxygen species (ROS) deacetylating activating isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). controversy whether SIRT3 acts oncogene tumor suppressor, investigated role B cell malignancies. mantle cell lymphoma patient samples, found lower SIRT3 protein expression associated worse overall survival. Further, SIRT3 protein expression reduced chronic lymphocytic leukemia primary samples malignant B cell lines compared primary B cells healthy donors. lower level expression correlated hyperacetylation IDH2 SOD2 mitochondrial proteins, lowered enzymatic activities, higher ROS levels. Overexpression SIRT3 decreased proliferation diminished Warburg-like phenotype SIRT3-deficient cell lines, effect largely dependent deacetylation IDH2 SOD2. Lastly, depletion SIRT3 malignant B cell lines resulted greater susceptibility treatment ROS scavenger result greater sensitivity inhibition hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha pathway, suggesting loss SIRT3 increases proliferation via ROS-dependent hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-independent mechanisms. study suggests SIRT3 acts tumor suppressor B cell malignancies, activating SIRT3 pathway might represent novel therapeutic approach treating B cell malignancies.
