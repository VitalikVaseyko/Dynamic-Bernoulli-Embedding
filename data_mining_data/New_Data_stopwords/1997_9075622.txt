 Embden-Meyerhof (EM) Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways sugar degradation analyzed representative species hyperthermophilic archaeal genera Thermococcus, Desulfurococcus, Thermoproteus, Sulfolobus, hyperthermophilic (eu)bacterial genus Thermotoga. analyses included (1) determination 13C-labeling patterns 1H- 13C-NMR spectroscopy fermentation products derived pyruvate fermentation specifically 13C-labeled glucose cell suspensions, (2) identification intermediates sugar degradation conversion 14C-labeled glucose cell extracts, (3) measurements enzyme activities cell extracts. Thermococcus celer Thermococcus litoralis fermented 13C-glucose acetate alanine via modified EM pathway (100%). modification involves ADP-dependent hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GAP:FdOR). Desulfurococcus amylolyticus fermented 13C-glucose acetate via modified EM pathway GAP:FdOR replaces GAP-DH/phosphoglycerate kinase. Thermoproteus tenax fermented 13C-glucose low amounts acetate alanine via simultaneous operation EM pathway (85%) ED pathway (15%). Aerobic Sulfolobus acidocaldarius fermented 13C-labeled glucose low amounts acetate alanine exclusively via ED pathway. anaerobic (eu)bacterium Thermotoga maritima fermented 13C-glucose acetate lactate via EM pathway (85%) ED pathway (15%). Cell extracts contained glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase, key enzymes conventional phosphorylated ED pathway, and, reported previously, enzymes conventional EM pathway. conclusion, glucose degraded hyperthermophilic archaea pyruvate either via modified EM pathways different types hexose kinases GAP-oxidizing enzymes, nonphosphorylated ED pathway, combination pathways. contrast, glucose catabolism hyperthermophilic (eu)bacterium Thermotoga involves conventional forms EM ED pathways. data accordance various previous reports.
