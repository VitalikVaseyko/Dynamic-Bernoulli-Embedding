 Trypanosoma brucei EATRO 110 infection deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) produced anemia 15 42 mice postinoculation days 14 70. infected anemic (IA) mice significantly higher reticulocyte counts (P less 0.025), spleen (P less 0.001) liver (P less 0.005) weights, higher parasitemia infected nonanemic (INA) mice. gamma-Globulin concentrations infected mice markedly increased, values INA mice 10% higher values IA mice. Erythrocyte hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, pyruvate kinase activities increased infected mice, whereas phosphofructokinase slightly decreased infected mice. Seemingly, development anemia related defects erythrocyte metabolism. Serum iron values infected mice similar controls. Storage iron (hemosiderin ferritin) concentrations increased spleen lesser extent liver. activity superoxide dismutase, enzyme favors conversion easily mobilized soluble ferritin poorly mobilized insoluble hemosiderin, decreased per unit weight enlarged spleen, although total activity increased. superoxide dismutase activity per unit weight liver altered infected mice although total liver activities increased. findings, well marked reticulocytosis, indicate lack iron supply part precipitating anemia brucei infection. Leukocytosis present infected animals associated lymphocytosis, eosinopenia, basophilia, monocytosis; changes marked IA INA mice.
