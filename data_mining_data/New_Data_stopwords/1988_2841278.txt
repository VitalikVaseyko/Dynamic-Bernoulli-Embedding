 study examined effects lung collapse, condition causes relative hypoxia lung tissues, superoxide dismutase (SOD), cytochrome oxidase (cyt ox), pyruvate kinase (py ki) activities rabbits. Cyanide-insensitive respiration measurements done collapsed contralateral lungs, index intracellular free radical production. Rabbits' right lungs collapsed 7 days animals killed. found control rabbit lungs contained approximately 25 SOD units/mg DNA measured 10(-5) KCN (total SOD) approximately 11 SOD units/mg DNA measured 10(-3) KCN (mitochondrial MnSOD). Right lung collapse caused 25% decrease mitochondrial SOD activity 7 days (P less 0.05), whereas significant changes occurred right left lungs' total SOD activity. control rabbits cyt ox activity averaged approximately 0.009 mumol ferrocytochrome c.min-1.mg DNA-1. Right lung collapse caused greater 40% decrease cyt ox activity 7 days collapse (P less 0.05), whereas cyt ox activity contralateral left lungs change. Pyruvate kinase activity, marker anaerobic glycolysis resulting tissue hypoxia, increased 49% collapsed right lungs (P less 0.01). Cyanide-insensitive respiration 83% higher 7 day-collapsed lungs (2.28 +/- 0.66 microliters O2.min-1.g-1) compared contralateral lungs (1.24 +/- 0.34, P less 0.05), indicating increased O2-. H2O2 production tissue homogenization normoxic PO2 (approximately 150 Torr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
