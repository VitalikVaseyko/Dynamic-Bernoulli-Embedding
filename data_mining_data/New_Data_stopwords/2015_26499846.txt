 Metabolic reprogramming widely observed cancer development confer cancer cells ability survive proliferate, even stressed, nutrient-limiting, conditions. famously known cancer cells favor "Warburg effect", i.e., enhanced glycolysis aerobic glycolysis, even ambient oxygen supply sufficient. addition, deregulated anabolism/catabolism fatty acids amino acids, especially glutamine, serine glycine, identified function metabolic regulators supporting cancer cell growth. Furthermore, extensive crosstalks revealed deregulated metabolic network cancer cell signaling. exciting advancements inspired new strategies treating various malignancies targeting cancer metabolism. review recent findings related regulation glucose, fatty acid amino acid metabolism, crosstalk, relevant cancer therapy strategy.
