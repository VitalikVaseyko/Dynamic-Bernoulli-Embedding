 incubated solutions hydrogen peroxide, erythrocytes stress-susceptible pigs produced by-products lipid peroxidation (as measured thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS]) erythrocytes stress-resistant pigs. Using technique, discrimination 2 pig types absolute hydrogen peroxide concentrations 0.9 1.5%. contrast methods identifying stress-susceptible pigs, osmotically induced erythrocyte lysis determination plasma pyruvate kinase creatine kinase activities, considerable overlap data observed pig types. increased TBARS production erythrocytes evidence existence antioxidant abnormality stress-susceptible pigs. However, discernible differences major blood antioxidant-related values stress-susceptible stress-resistant pigs, nature defect remains unclear. production TBARS erythrocytes incubated hydrogen peroxide provides improved method identifying stress-susceptible pigs.
