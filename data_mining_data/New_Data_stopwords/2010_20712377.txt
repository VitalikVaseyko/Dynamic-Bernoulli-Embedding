 Protein fluorescence small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) used monitor effector affinity conformational changes previously associated allosteric regulation rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (M(1)-PYK). absence substrate [phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)], SAXS-monitored conformational changes M(1)-PYK elicited binding phenylalanine (an allosteric inhibitor reduces affinity M(1)-PYK PEP) similar observed upon binding alanine 2-aminobutyric acid. assay conditions, small amino acids bind protein elicit minimal change affinity protein PEP. Therefore, changes scattering signatures represent cleft closure via domain rotation previously interpreted, conclude motions sufficient elicit allosteric inhibition. Additionally, although PEP similar affinities free enzyme M(1)-PYK-small amino acid complexes (i.e., small amino acids minimal allosteric effects), PEP binding elicits different changes SAXS signature free enzyme versus M(1)-PYK-small amino acid complexes.
