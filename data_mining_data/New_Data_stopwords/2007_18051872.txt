 differences metabolism Escherichia coli DH5alpha acetate-tolerant mutant DA19 analyzed based activity key enzymes involved central metabolism strains continuously cultured nitrogen source-limited defined media. activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) DA19 increased compared DH5alpha, acetate kinase (ACK) phosphofructosekinase (PFK) decreased. indicated carbon flux DA19 entered phosphopentose pathway (PPP) less entered glycolytic (EMP) pathway acetic acid production (Ack-Pta) pathway. Therefore, differences activity key enzyme coincided increased cell yield based consumed glucose (Y(X/G)) decreased production acetic acid pyruvate DA19. G6PDH ICDH DH5alpha up-regulated addition adenine, ACK PFK down-regulated. hand, adenine little effect DA19. enzymes except PFK strains down-regulated sodium acetate, especially activity ICDH DH5alpha. results suggested changed flux central metabolic pathways also consistent changes growth properties byproducts formation.
