 addition glyoxylate tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf discs inhibited glycolate synthesis photorespiration increased net photosynthetic (14)CO(2) fixation. inhibition photorespiration investigated studying effect glyoxylate stimulation photosynthesis occurs atmospheric O(2) level decreased 21 3% (the Warburg effect). Warburg effect usually ascribed increased glycolate synthesis metabolism occurs higher O(2) concentrations. Photosynthesis control discs increased 59.1 94.7 micromoles CO(2) per gram fresh weight per hour (a 60% increase) O(2) level lowered 21 3%, rate discs floated 15 millimolar glyoxylate increased 82.0 99.7 micromoles CO(2) per gram fresh weight per hour (a 22% increase). decrease O(2) sensitivity photosynthesis presence glyoxylate explained changes rate glycolate synthesis conditions.The rate metabolism added glyoxylate tobacco leaf discs 1.35 micromoles per gram fresh weight per hour dependent O(2) concentration atmosphere. rate metabolism 10% amount stimulation rate CO(2) fixation caused glyoxylate treatment molar carbon basis. Glyoxylate (10 millimolar) effect carboxylase/oxygenase activity isolated ribulose diphosphate carboxylase. Although biochemical mechanism glyoxylate inhibits glycolate synthesis photorespiration thereby decreases Warburg effect still uncertain, results show cellular metabolites regulate extent Warburg effect.
