 AIMS: tumor microenvironment characterized highly reducing redox status, low pH, hypoxia. Anti-angiogenic therapies solid tumors frequently function two steps: transient normalization structurally functionally aberrant tumor blood vessels increased blood perfusion, followed pruning tumor blood vessels resultant cessation nutrients oxygen delivery required tumor growth. Conventional anatomic vascular imaging impractical insufficient distinguish two steps tumor response anti-angiogenic therapies. Here, investigated whether noninvasive imaging tumor redox state energy metabolism could used characterize anti-angiogenic drug-induced transient vascular normalization. RESULTS: Daily treatment squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) tumor-bearing mice multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib resulted rapid decrease tumor microvessel density suppression tumor growth. Tumor pO2 imaging electron paramagnetic resonance imaging showed transient increase tumor oxygenation 2-4 days sunitinib treatment, implying improved tumor perfusion. window vascular normalization, magnetic resonance imaging redox status using exogenously administered nitroxide probe hyperpolarized (13)C MRI metabolic flux pyruvate/lactate couple revealed oxidative shift tumor redox status. INNOVATION: Redox-sensitive metabolic couples serve noninvasive surrogate markers identify vascular normalization window tumors imaging techniques. CONCLUSION: multimodal imaging approach characterize physiological, metabolic, redox changes tumors useful distinguish different stages anti-angiogenic treatment.
