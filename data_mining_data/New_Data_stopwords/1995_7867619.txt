 discovery mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family protein kinases sparked intensive effort elucidate role regulation many cellular processes. protein kinases originally identified based rapid activation insulin. review concentrate examining evidence role MAP kinases Erk-1 Erk-2 mediating effects insulin. good evidence favour direct role MAP kinase growth-promoting effects insulin regulation Glut-1 c-fos expression, AP-1 transcriptional complex activity, means conclusive. MAP kinase may also play role control mRNA translation insulin. hand, evidence suggests MAP kinase sufficient acute regulation glucose transport (Glut-4 translocation), glycogen synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. findings suggest insulin may utilise least three distinct signalling pathways involve MAP kinase.
