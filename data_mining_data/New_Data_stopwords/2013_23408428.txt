 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), like cancers, possesses unique bioenergetic state aerobic glycolysis known Warburg effect. Here, documented methylene blue (MB) reverses Warburg effect evidenced increasing oxygen consumption reduction lactate production GBM cell lines. MB decreases GBM cell proliferation halts cell cycle phase. activation AMP-activated protein kinase, MB inactivates downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase decreases cyclin expression. Structure-activity relationship analysis demonstrated toluidine blue O, MB derivative similar bioenergetic actions, exerts similar action GBM cell proliferation. contrast, two MB derivatives, 2-chlorophenothiazine promethazine, exert effect cellular bioenergetics inhibit GBM cell proliferation. MB inhibits cell proliferation temozolomide-sensitive -insensitive GBM cell lines. human GBM xenograft model, single daily dosage MB activate AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, tumor regression observed. summary, current study provides first vitro proof concept reversal Warburg effect might novel therapy GBM.
