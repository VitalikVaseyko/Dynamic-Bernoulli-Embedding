 95% patients pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, recurrence observed following chemotherapy. Findings several studies indicated cancer stem cells (CSCs) resistant anticancer agents may involved cancer recurrence metastasis. CD44 protein major CSC marker, CD44 also plays indispensable role CSC properties several cancers, including pancreatic cancer; however, clinical approach exists inhibit CD44 activity. Here, performed knock-in/knockdown experiments, demonstrate forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)/liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1beta (PGC-1beta)/pyruvate dehydrogenase-A1 pathway essential CD44 expression CSC properties. observed patients exhibiting high pyruvate dehydrogenase-A1 expression poor prognosis. Systemic PGC-1beta knock-out mice fertile viable exhibit overt phenotype normal conditions. suggests cGMP induction PGC-1beta inhibition represent potential strategies treating patients pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
