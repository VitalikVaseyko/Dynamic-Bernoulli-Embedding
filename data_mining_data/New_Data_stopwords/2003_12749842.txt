 Single gene overexpression product pathways lysine synthesis often employed metabolic engineering efforts aiming pathway flux amplification metabolite overproduction. approach limited due metabolic flux imbalances often lead unpredictable physiological responses suboptimal metabolite productivity. deficiency overcome coordinated overexpression one flux controlling genes production pathway selected considering individual contributions cell physiology concept demonstrated simultaneous overexpression pyruvate carboxylase aspartate kinase, two key enzymes central carbon metabolism lysine production pathway Corynebacterium glutamicum. Contrary expectations based importance two genes lysine production, monocistronic overexpression either gene results marginal changes overall lysine productivity due either reduced cell growth reduced lysine specific productivity. contrast, simultaneous amplification activities two enzymes yielded 250% increase lysine specific productivity lactate minimal medium without affecting growth rate final cell density culture. results demonstrate significant flux amplification complex pathways involving central carbon metabolism possible coordinated overexpression one gene pathway. achieved either external, gene expression inducing, controls controls responding physiological cellular state.
