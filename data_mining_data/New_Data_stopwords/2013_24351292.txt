 Cancer cells tend utilize aerobic glycolysis even normoxic conditions, commonly called "Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis often directly correlates malignancy, purpose, any, metastasis remains unclear. wild-type KISS1 metastasis suppressor expressed, aerobic glycolysis decreases oxidative phosphorylation predominates. However, KISS1 missing secretion signal peptide (DeltaSS), invasion metastasis longer suppressed cells continue metabolize using aerobic glycolysis. KISS1-expressing cells 30% 50% mitochondrial mass DeltaSS-expressing cells, accompanied correspondingly increased mitochondrial gene expression higher expression PGC1alpha, master coactivator regulates mitochondrial mass metabolism. PGC1alpha-mediated downstream pathways (i.e., fatty acid synthesis beta-oxidation) differentially regulated KISS1, apparently reliant upon direct KISS1 interaction NRF1, major transcription factor involved mitochondrial biogenesis. Since downstream effects could reversed using short hairpin RNA KISS1 PGC1alpha, data appear directly connect changes mitochondria mass, cellular glucose metabolism, metastasis.
