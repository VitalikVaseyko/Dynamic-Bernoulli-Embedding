 general method developed synthesis chiral [16O,17O,18O]phosphate monoesters known absolute configuration. analytic method determining absolute configuration chiral phosphate esters also developed, based isotope effects 17O 18O phosphorus 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum. methods shown phosphoryl transfer catalysed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase occurs inversion configuration. simply interpreted "in-line' transfer phosphoryl group substrates enzyme-substrate ternary complex.
