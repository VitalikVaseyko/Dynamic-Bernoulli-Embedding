 lack simple rapid identification system Bifidobacterium species makes difficult use industrial applications. obtain valuable discriminating factor, studied different strains, human isolates two molecular taxonomy methods. First method based chrono-differentiation. metabolic gene (pyruvate kinase) chosen used systematic discriminating factor. comparison 40 pyruvate kinase protein sequences allowed us synthesize two oligonucleotides able amplify fragment corresponding gene strains. Based partial pyruvate kinase gene sequences, several clusters could identified. second method used study based 16S rRNA sequences analysis. compared sequences present GenBank database, allowed separate bifidobacteria species different clusters. different obtained partial pyruvate kinase gene sequences analysis. So, combining methods, able identify isolates, 10% could strictly identified using 16S rRNA method. Moreover, pyruvate kinase analysis allowed differentiate ambivalent groups B. animalis/B. lactis B. infantis/B. longum, created different clusters B. infantis species group, questioning homogeneity species.
