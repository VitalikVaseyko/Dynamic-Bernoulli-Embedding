 OBJECTIVE: prospectively determine reliability validity serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) biomarker mitochondrial disease cross-sectional cohort adults mitochondrial disease specialist primary care tertiary referral clinic. METHODS: recruited 140 subjects, including 54 adults mitochondrial disease, 20 patients nonmitochondrial neuromuscular disease, 66 control subjects, November 2011 October 2012. compared serum FGF-21 concentrations classical biomarkers, serum creatine kinase, lactate, pyruvate, lactate pyruvate ratio, determine validity reliability biomarker mitochondrial disease. determined sensitivity, odds ratio (OR), overall reliability FGF-21 marker mitochondrial disease using statistical analyses. RESULTS: Median serum FGF-21 concentrations significantly elevated patients mitochondrial disease differed significantly experimental groups. FGF-21 showed markedly higher diagnostic (45.7 [95% confidence interval = 12.6-166.5], p < 0.0001) compared biomarkers best predictor disease according sensitivity receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling potential confounders, FGF-21 measured parameter capable predicting mitochondrial disease. CONCLUSION: prospective study establishes serum FGF-21 levels sensitive biomarker mitochondrial disease demonstrates best predictor disorder compared serum levels classical indicators: creatine kinase, lactate, pyruvate, lactate pyruvate ratio.
