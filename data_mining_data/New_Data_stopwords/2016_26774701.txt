 AIMS: Pulmonary arterial hypertension [1] proliferative disorder associated enhanced proliferation suppressed apoptosis pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) implicated development PAH regulates vascular tone functions. However, cellular signaling mechanisms triggered ROS PAH still unknown. Hence, wished characterize signaling mechanisms triggered ROS. METHODS RESULTS: Western blots, showed increased intracellular ROS caused inhibition glycolytic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activity promoting phosphorylation PKM2. Monocrotaline (MCT)-induced rats developed severe PAH right ventricular hypertrophy, significant increase P-PKM2 decrease pyruvate kinase activity could attenuated treatments PKM2 activators, FBP l-serine. antioxidant NAC, apocynin MnTBAP similar protective effects development PAH. vitro assays confirmed inhibition PKM2 activity could modulate flux glycolytic intermediates support cell proliferation increased pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Increased ROS decreased PKM2 activity also promoted Cav1.2 expression intracellular calcium. CONCLUSION: data provide new evidence PKM2 makes critical regulatory contribution PAHs first time. Decreased pyruvate kinase M2 activity confers additional advantages rat PASMCs allowing sustain anti-oxidant responses thereby support cell survival PAH. may become novel treatment strategy PAH using PKM2 activators.
