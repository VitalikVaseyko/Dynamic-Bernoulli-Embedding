 Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) master regulators adaptive responses low oxygen, alpha-subunits rapidly degraded ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal pathway hydroxylation. Aberrant accumulation activation HIFs closely linked many types cancer. However, hydroxylation HIFalpha delivery ubiquitination machinery regulated remains unclear. show Rho-related BTB domain-containing protein 3 (RHOBTB3) directly interacts hydroxylase PHD2 promote HIFalpha hydroxylation. RHOBTB3 also directly interacts von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, component E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating ubiquitination HIFalpha. Remarkably, RHOBTB3 dimerizes LIMD1, constructs RHOBTB3/LIMD1-PHD2-VHL-HIFalpha complex effect maximal degradation HIFalpha. Hypoxia reduces RHOBTB3-centered complex formation, resulting accumulation HIFalpha. Importantly, expression level RHOBTB3 greatly reduced human renal carcinomas, RHOBTB3 deficiency significantly elevates Warburg effect accelerates xenograft growth. work thus reveals RHOBTB3 serves scaffold organize multi-subunit complex promotes hydroxylation, ubiquitination degradation HIFalpha.
