 Circadian rhythms control metabolism energy homeostasis, role skeletal muscle clock never explored. generated conditional inducible mouse lines muscle-specific ablation core clock gene Bmal1. Skeletal muscles mice showed impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake reduced protein levels GLUT4, insulin-dependent glucose transporter, TBC1D1, Rab-GTPase involved GLUT4 translocation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity also reduced due altered expression circadian genes Pdk4 Pdp1, coding PDH kinase phosphatase, respectively. PDH inhibition leads reduced glucose oxidation diversion glycolytic intermediates alternative metabolic pathways, revealed metabolome analysis. impaired glucose metabolism induced muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout suggests major physiological role muscle clock prepare transition rest/fasting phase active/feeding phase, glucose becomes predominant fuel skeletal muscle.
