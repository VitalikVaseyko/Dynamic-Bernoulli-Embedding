 novel metabolomic method based gas chromatography-mass spectrometry applied investigate serum metabolites response dietary Gln supplementation piglets. Sixteen, 21-d-old pigs weaned assigned randomly 2 isonitrogenous diets: 1) Gln diet, contained 1% L-Gln (as-fed basis), 2) control diet, contained L-Ala make diet isonitrogenous Gln diet. Serum samples collected characterize metabolites 30-d treatment. addition, 4 liver samples per treatment collected examine enzyme activity gene expression involved metabolic regulation. Results indicated 12 metabolites altered (P < 0.05) Gln treatment, including carbohydrates, AA, fatty acids. leave-one-out cross validation random forest analysis indicated Pro important among 12 metabolites. Thus, data demonstrate control Gln-supplemented pigs differed (P < 0.05) terms metabolism carbohydrates, Pro, Tyr, glycerophospholipids. Principal component analysis yielded separate clusters profiles Gln control groups. Metabolic enzyme activities Ala aminotransferase hexokinase increased 26.8% (P = 0.026) 26.2% (P = 0.004) liver Gln-supplemented pigs vs. control, respectively, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK) activity decreased 29.1% (P = 0.001). gene expression PK liver decreased 66.1% (P = 0.034) Gln treatment 30 d. differences observed mRNA abundance mammalian target rapamycin PPARgamma. basis data, Gln treatment affected carbohydrate, lipid, AA metabolism whole body early weaned piglets. findings provide insight specific metabolic pathways lay groundwork complex metabolic alteration response dietary Gln supplementation pigs.
