 composition seminal plasma metabolism sperm cyprinid fishAlburnus alburnus investigated. Statistically significant correlations found motility parameters seminal fluid osmolality, pH, Na(+), K(+) protein levels (negative correlations: % immotile spermatozoa-Na(+), K(+); positive correlations: % motile spermatozoa-osmolality, pH, Na(+), K(+), protein; % linear motile spermatozoa-pH protein; swimming velocity spermatozoa-pH, Na(+), protein). Spermatozoan motility ATP metabolism glycolysis correlated indicated measurement ATPase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activity. physiological meanings correlations possible significance quality control semen discussed.
