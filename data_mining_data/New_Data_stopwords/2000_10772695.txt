 CONTEXT: preservative solution ADSOL (adenine, dextrose, sorbitol, sodium chloride mannitol) maintains red cell viability blood trans-fusion 6 weeks. would useful know preservation qualities longer periods. OBJECTIVE: determine red cell biochemical parameters peri-ods 14 weeks order determine whether red cell metabo-lism integrity would justify studies aiming increasing red cell preservation viability. DESIGN: Biochemical evaluation designed study red cell preservation. SETTING: Sao Paulo University erythrocyte metabolism referral center. SAMPLE: Six normal blood donors University Hospital Universidade Federal Parana, Curitiba, Brazil. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Weekly assay erythrocyte adenosine-5;-triphosphate (ATP), 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG), hexokinase (HX), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase (6-PGD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD), glutathione reduc-tase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), plasma sodium potas-sium, blood pH, membrane proteins red cells preserved ADSOL studied storage 14 weeks storage. RESULTS: ADSOL preservation, erythrocyte ATP concentration decreased 60% 5 weeks, 90% 10 weeks; pH fell 6.8 6. 4 14th week. 2,3-DPG concentration stable first week, fell 90% 3 weeks exhausted 5 weeks. end 5th week, activity decrease 16-30% Hx, GAPD, GR, G-6-PD 6-PGD, 35% PFK GSHPx, 45% PK observed. Thereafter, uniform 10% decay observed enzymes 14th week. red blood cell membrane pro-teins show significant alterations polyacrylamide gel electro-phoresis (SDS-PAGE) 14 weeks. CONCLUSION: Although blood viability shown poor 6th week 14th week storage due ATP 2,3-DPG depletion, biochemical parameters remained fairly good condition longer storage. gradual uniform decay activity throughout 14 weeks, seems ADSOL-preserved red cells may used red cell enzyme standards membrane proteins well.
