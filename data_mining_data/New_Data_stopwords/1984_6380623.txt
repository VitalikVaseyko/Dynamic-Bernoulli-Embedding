 effects hemin conversion pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes M2-type L-type K562 cells investigated. Immunofluorescence, ion exchange chromatography, electrophoretic studies showed untreated K562 cells contained M2-type PK, eight 20 days induction hemin, concomitant hemoglobin F synthesis, L-type PK levels increased M2-type PK levels decreased. Electrophoretic study revealed three hybrid isozymes L-type M2-type PK. conclude conversion PK isozymes M2-type L-type erythroid precursor cells occurs early stage maturation.
