 Two forms pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) present Salmonella typhimurium purified homogeneity cultures (NH4)2SO4 fractionation gel filtration, anion-exchange affinity chromatography. Mr values, subunit structure, amino acid composition activity stability conditions determined two forms. Kinetic regulatory properties two purified isoenzymes studied.
