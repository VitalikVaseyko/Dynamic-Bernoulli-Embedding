 Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 novel regulator insulin-independent glucose transport 3T3-L1 adipocytes glucose triglyceride lowering effects rodent models diabetes. study, found FGF-21 significantly attenuate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced damage H9c2 cells (rat heart). However, unclear signal transduction pathway involved cardioprotective effect FGF-21. Thus, study designed investigate potential mechanism induced FGF-21. results showed FGF-21 treatment prevented oxidative stress apoptosis associated I/R damage reducing levels superoxide anions, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta activating Akt phosphorylation, recovering levels ATP synthase pyruvate kinase isozymes M1 protein kinase C, thereby improving energy supply. summary, conclude FGF-21 protects H9c2 cells I/R injury mainly Akt-GSK-3beta-caspase-3 dependent pathway, preventing oxidative stress, recovery energy supply.
