 mechanism fatty acid addition leads inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase intact rat liver mitochondria investigated. cases fatty acid octanoate added mitochondria oxidizing succinate. Addition fatty acid caused inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase mitochondria incubated State 3 conditions (glucose plus hexokinase), uncoupled, oligomycin-treated mitochondria, rotenone-menadione-treated mitochondria, uncoupled mitochondria mitochondria incubated State 4 conditions. number metabolic conditions found pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivated concomitant elevation ATP/ADP ratio. consistent inverse relationship ATP/ADP ratio pyruvate dehydrogenase activity proposed various laboratories. However, several metabolic conditions pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivated ATP/ADP ratio either unchanged even decreased. observation implies likely regulatory factors involved fatty acid-mediated inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase. Incubation conditions State 3 found ATP/ADP acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratios remained constant pyruvate dehydrogenase activity correlated inversely NADH/NAD+ ratio. State 3 conditions found ATP/ADP NADH/NAD+ ratios remained constant pyruvate dehydrogenase activity correlated inversely acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio. evidence supporting experiments intact mitochondria observation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity mitochondrial extract stimulated strongly acetyl-CoA inhibited NAD+ CoASH. contrast acetyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA inhibited kinase activity. results indicate inactivation pyruvate dehydrogenase fatty acid isolated rat liver mitochondria may mediated effects NADH/NAD+ ratio acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio interconversion active inactive forms enzyme complex catalyzed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase.
