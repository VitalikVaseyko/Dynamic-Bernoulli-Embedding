 fed-batch process studied lactate glycerol supply growth phase glycerol supply L-phenylalanine production recombinant E. coli K-12. Lactic acid feeding necessary growth genes encoding PEP-consuming pyruvate kinase isoenzymes (pykA, pykF) deleted. unexpected glucose efflux (67.6 +/- 2.3 mgGlucose gCDW (-1) ) measured cells harvested resuspended mineral medium metabolic perturbation experiments. efflux prohibited application experiments, characterization intracellular carbon storage necessary. Therefore, two genetically engineered strains (one lacking glycogen metabolism another additionally lacking trehalose synthesis) applied fed-batch process. Trehalose synthesis accumulation lactate clearly identified source glucose efflux cell harvest resuspension. Cultivations strains active pyruvate kinase successfully identified lactate carbon source causing intracellular trehalose storage. usage glycerol sole carbon source whole process enabled improved process performance inhibited trehalose accumulation. Overall, setup allows application perturbation experiments.
