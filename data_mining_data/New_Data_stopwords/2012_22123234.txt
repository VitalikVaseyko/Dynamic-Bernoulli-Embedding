 PURPOSE REVIEW: revival interest tumor metabolism underway discuss recent results focus central theme Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis. RECENT FINDINGS: M2 tumor-specific isoform pyruvate kinase generated much interest, reported PKM2 specific tumors. Despite setback, reciprocal regulation PKM2, prolyl hydroxylase 3 HIF-1 positive feedback loop shows PKM2 important tumor metabolism. Hexokinase II reported crucial regulator glycolysis glioblastoma multiforme, importance lactate dehydrogenase underlined evidence 'lactate-based dialog' exists cancer cells endothelial cells. growing appreciation role oncogenes tumor suppressor genes Warburg effect reflected reports regulation glutamine metabolism p53, role c-Myc high glucose uptake tumors, regulation ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5 (ENTPD5) ATP consumption AKT. sirtuins, SIRT3 SIRT6, also shown play central roles aerobic glycolysis aspects tumor metabolism. SUMMARY: results discussed illustrate growing integration previously distinct fields molecular biological metabolic cancer research show synergy beginning yield complete comprehensive understanding tumor cell.
