 Corynebacterium glutamicum utilize acetic acid propionic acid growth amino acid production. Growth acetate sole carbon source requires acetate activation acetate kinase (AK) phosphotransacetylase (PTA), encoded pta-ack operon. Genetic enzymatic studies showed enzymes also catalyze propionate activation required growth propionate sole carbon source. However, glucose present co-substrate strain lacking AK-PTA pathway still able utilize acetate propionate growth indicating alternative activation pathway exists. shown (13)C-labelling experiments, carbon skeleton acetate conserved activation acetyl-CoA pathway. Metabolic flux analysis growth acetate-glucose mixture revealed absence AK-PTA pathway carbon fluxes glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis via PEP carboxylase and/or pyruvate carboxylase increased, glyoxylate cycle flux decreased. DNA microarray experiments identified cg2840 constitutively highly expressed gene putatively encoding CoA transferase. Purified His-tagged Cg2840 protein active CoA transferase interconverting acetyl-, propionyl- succinyl-moieties CoA acceptors donors. Strains lacking CoA transferase AK-PTA pathway could neither activate acetate propionate presence absence glucose. Thus, short-chain fatty acids co-metabolized carbon sources, CoA transferase AK-PTA pathway constitute redundant system activation acetate propionate.
