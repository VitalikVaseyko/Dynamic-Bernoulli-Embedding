 Synaptic activity drives changes gene expression promote long lasting adaptations neuronal structure function. One example adaptive response buildup acquired neuroprotection, synaptic activity- gene transcription-mediated increase resistance neurons harmful conditions. hallmark acquired neuroprotection stabilization mitochondrial structure function. therefore re-examined previously identified sets synaptic activity-regulated genes identify genes directly linked mitochondrial function. mouse rat primary hippocampal cultures, synaptic activity caused up-regulation glycolytic genes concomitant down-regulation genes required oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance. Changes metabolic gene expression induced action potential bursting, glutamate bath application activating extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. specific coordinate pattern gene expression changes suggested synaptic activity promotes shift neuronal energy metabolism oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis, also known Warburg effect. ability neurons up-regulate glycolysis has, however, debated. therefore used FACS sorting show that, mixed neuron glia co-cultures, activity-dependent regulation metabolic gene expression occurred neurons. Changes gene expression accompanied changes phosphorylation-dependent regulation key metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase. Finally, increased synaptic activity caused increase ratio l-lactate production oxygen consumption primary hippocampal cultures. Based data suggest existence synaptic activity-mediated neuronal Warburg effect may promote mitochondrial homeostasis neuroprotection.
