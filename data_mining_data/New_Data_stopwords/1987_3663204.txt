 improved method isolation rat brain mitochondria described. preparation exhibits respiratory control index (RCI) 6 7.3 presence pyruvate malate glutamate malate, respectively. RCI decreases 2.5 presence Mg++. phosphorylation extramitochondrially added formed ADP suppressed carboxyatractyloside (CAT) inhibition adenine nucleotide translocator, remaining respiration amounts 6 nmol O2/min X mg mitochondrial protein. results ratio 16 19 quotient phosphorylating active-state respiration CAT inhibited respiration refer high degree mitochondrial coupling respiration. Therefore remaining respiration presence Mg++ due phosphokinase activity located outside inner membrane intact mitochondria nonphosphorylating mitochondrial fragments. following activities observed: Oligomycin sensitive ATPase, 47 mU/mg protein; hexokinase, 272 mU/mg protein; creatinphosphokinase, 116 mU/mg protein; surprisingly low activity adenylatekinase, 57 mU/mg protein.
