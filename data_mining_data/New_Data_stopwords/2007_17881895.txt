 Immunohistochemical evaluation lung carcinomas key enzymes involved cellular metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase LDH 1 5, pyruvate dehydrogenase PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase PDHK-1, monocarboxylate transporters MCT 1, 2 4, glucose transporter GLUT1, hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha 2alpha) show complementary metabolic profile cancer cells tumor-associated stroma. Cancer cells share enzyme/transporter activities suggestive anaerobic metabolism high affinity glucose absorption, anaerobic glycolysis lactate extrusion. hand, tumour-associated fibroblasts express patterns involved aerobic pathways lactate oxidation. findings bring forward hypothesis tumor associated stroma accomplice tumor growth survival sustaining independent cellular metabolic tumor domain. development agents exploiting cancer specific metabolic pathways may prove importance treatment lung cancer.
