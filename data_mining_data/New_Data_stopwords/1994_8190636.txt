 report modification vivo footprinting assay described. method includes dimethyl sulfate treatment whole yeast cells, followed reiterative primer extension methylated genomic DNA using Taq DNA polymerase. appropriate reaction conditions chain extension terminates opposite methylated purine Taq DNA polymerase encounters modified adenine guanine. procedure used examine, vivo DNA-protein contacts upstream activation site (UAS) Saccharomyces cerevisiae PYK gene. vivo analysis, using isogenic strains yeast Escherichia coli transformed plasmid DNAs, confirmed binding trans-acting factor RAP1 transcriptional activator GCR1 cis-acting recognition sites located within PYK UAS element.
