 cultivation mixture xylose glucose, Bacteroides xylanolyticus X5-1 showed neither diauxic growth substrate preference. Xylose-limited continuous-culture cells able consume xylose glucose single substrates mixed substrates without lag phase. glucose growth-limiting substrate, microorganism unable consume xylose. However, presence small amount glucose pyruvate, xylose utilized short lag phase. glucose-limited cells, xylose isomerase present low activity xylulose kinase activity could detected. addition mixture xylose glucose, xylose isomerase induced immediately xylulose kinase induced 30 min. induction two enzymes sensitive chloramphenicol, showing de novo synthesis. Xylose uptake glucose-grown cells low, uptake rate could increased incubated xylose-glucose mixture. increase uptake rate affected chloramphenicol, indicating constitutive uptake system activated. inability B. xylanolyticus X5-1 cells undergoing glucose-limited continuous culture induce xylose catabolic pathway addition xylose probably caused energy limitation.
