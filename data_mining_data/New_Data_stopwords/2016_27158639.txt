 important component methodology assess role tumor microenvironment tumor growth survival. tackle problem, adapted original approach Warburg (1), combining thin tissue slices Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) determine detailed metabolic activity human tissues. SIRM enables tracing metabolic transformations source molecules glucose glutamine defined time periods, requirement detailed pathway tracing flux analysis. approach, maintain freshly resected tissue slices (both cancerous non- cancerous organ subject) cell culture media, treat appropriate stable isotope-enriched nutrients, e.g.(13)C6-glucose (13)C5, (15)N2 -glutamine. slices viable least 24 h, make possible eliminate systemic influence target tissue metabolism maintaining original 3D cellular architecture. therefore excellent pre-clinical platform assessing effect therapeutic agents target tissue metabolism therapeutic efficacy individual patients (2,3).
