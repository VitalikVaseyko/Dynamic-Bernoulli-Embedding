 highly proliferative cancer cells, energy predominantly produced high rate glycolysis, followed lactic acid fermentation, despite availability oxygen - observation known Warburg effect. consequence, cells employing glycolytic pathway require high uptake glucose increased metabolic rates maintain proliferation. hypothesized blocking glucose uptake using modified glucose molecules, apoptosis cancer cells induced. study, showed several poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified glucose compounds could reduce cell proliferation various cancer cell lines phenomenon blocked availability glucose transporters reduced AKT1 (serine/threonine-specific protein kinase) activation. Xenograft cancer models intravenously administered glucose-conjugated branched PEG (GBrP) daily 14 show little tumor development, compared control group without GBrP treatment. toxicological effects pharmacokinetics PEGylated glucose studied rodents. PEGylated glucose exerts systemic toxicity 40 mg kg(-1) dosage. However, doses 80 mg kg(-1) show dose-dependent toxicity organs analyzed. present results suggest PEGylated glucose promising "metabolic therapy" approach treatment cancer.
