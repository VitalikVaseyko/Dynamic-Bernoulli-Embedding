 Triethylcholine (triethyl-2-hydroxyethyl ammonium) compared, actions neuromuscular transmission, motor end-plate blocking drugs tubocurarine decamethonium, anticholinesterase neostigmine, closely related drug tetraethylammonium. experiments carried conscious rabbits mice, tibialis anterior muscle cats chloralose anaesthesia isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation rat. Anticholinesterase activity determined manometrically using Warburg apparatus. Triethylcholine possessed slight curare-like action, effect shown weak transient contribute slowly developing long-lasting transmission failure occurs selectively frequently excited nervemuscle preparations exercised conscious animals. confirmed site blocking action triethylcholine pre-junctional. Triethylcholine often produced slight potentiation contractions blocking them. effect due depolarizing anticholinesterase action, concluded slight initial facilitating action triethylcholine neuromuscular transmission due increase quantity acetylcholine released nerve impulse. Tetraethylammonium much powerful triethylcholine respect. pre-junctional transmission failure produced triethylcholine could explained simply basis initial excessive release led exhaustion transmitter.
