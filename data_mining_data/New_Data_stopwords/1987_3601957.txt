 previously demonstrated circadian variation pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. PK key enzyme glycolysis, whose activity shown regulated level enzyme concentration catalytic activity. investigate mechanism regulation components circadian rhythm PK activity, Michaelis-Menten kinetic values determined. C57BL/6J male mice standardized 2 weeks 12 hr light followed 12 hr dark (lights 0600 hr CST), killed 3-hr intervals (six mice/circadian stage) 24-hr span. Vmax values, measure enzyme concentration, found characterized circadian variation (P = 0.01 ANOVA, P = 0.38 cosinor analysis). time highest observed Vmax occurred early dark continued entire dark early light spans. abrupt decrease Vmax (-40%) observed end light span. PK catalytic activity regulated covalent modification (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) enzyme, phosphorylated, inactive form enzyme high Km major substrate (1.41 mM phosphoenol pyruvate; PEP). Km values found characterized circadian rhythm (P less 0.001 cosinor analysis) whose acrophase (1117 hr) beginning light cycle (high Km indicates low catalytic activity subsaturating PEP concentrations). results indicate circadian rhythm PK activity composed least two components. Enzyme concentration high dark early light phases decreases end light phase. Concentration recovers rapidly within 3 hr lights turned off. Catalytic activity maximal time enzyme concentration becomes maximal dark phase. Maximal efficiency enzyme thus achieved time animals eating glycolysis operating high levels.
