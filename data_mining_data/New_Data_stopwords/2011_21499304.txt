 growing interest among public scientists dichloroacetate (DCA) potential anticancer drug. Credible evidence exists antitumor activity compound, high concentrations needed significant therapeutic effect. Unfortunately, high concentrations produce detrimental side effects involving nervous system, thereby precluding use cancer treatment. mechanistic basis compound's antitumor activity ability activate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inhibition pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. compound inhibits kinase micromolar concentrations, known therapeutically prohibitive high doses needed suppression tumor growth. hypothesized lack effective mechanisms entry DCA tumor cells may underlie phenomenon. show SLC5A8 transports DCA effectively high affinity. transporter expressed normal cells, expression silenced tumor cells epigenetic mechanisms. lack transporter makes tumor cells resistant antitumor activity DCA. However, transporter expressed tumor cells ectopically, cells become sensitive drug low concentrations. evident breast cancer cells, colon cancer cells prostate cancer cells. Normal cells, constitutively express transporter, however affected compound, indicating tumor cell-selective therapeutic activity. mechanism compound's antitumor activity still remains ability inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase force mitochondrial oxidation pyruvate. silencing SLC5A8 tumors involves DNA methylation expression induced treatment DNA methylation inhibitors, findings suggest combining DCA DNA methylation inhibitor would offer means reduce doses DCA avoid detrimental effects associated high doses without compromising antitumor activity.
