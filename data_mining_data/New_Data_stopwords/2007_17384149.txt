 increased dependency glycolysis ATP production considered hallmark tumor cells. Whether increase glycolytic activity due mainly inherent metabolic alterations hypoxic microenvironment remains controversial. transformed human adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) using genetic alterations described differentiated cells. data suggest MSC require disruption pathways shown differentiated cells confer fully transformed phenotype. Furthermore, found MSC glycolytic primary human fibroblasts and, contrast differentiated cells, depend increased aerobic glycolysis ATP production transformation. data indicate aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) intrinsic component transformation adult stem cells, oncogenic adaptation bioenergetic requirements, circumstances, may also rely increases oxidative phosphorylation. find, however, reversible increase transcription glycolytic enzymes tumors generated transformed MSC, indicating secondary phenomenon resulting adaptation tumor microenvironment.
