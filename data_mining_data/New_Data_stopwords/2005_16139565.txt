 Although abnormalities cardiac fatty acid metabolism involved development several cardiac pathologies, mechanisms underlying changes well understood. Given prominent role played peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta cardiac fatty acid metabolism, aim study examine effects nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation activity nuclear receptor. Embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells stimulated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed reduction (38%, P<0.05) mRNA levels PPARbeta/delta-target gene pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) prevented presence NF-kappaB inhibitors parthenolide (10 microM) atorvastatin (10 microM). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed parthenolide atorvastatin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated NF-kappaB binding activity H9c2 cardiac cells. LPS-stimulation H9c2 cardiac cells also led 30% reduction (P<0.05) mRNA levels PPARgamma Coactivator 1 (PGC-1) consistent reduction protein levels coactivator. presence either atorvastatin parthenolide, reduction PGC-1 expression prevented. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed LPS-stimulation led reduction physical interaction PGC-1 PPARbeta/delta reduction prevented presence atorvastatin. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed parthenolide atorvastatin prevented LPS-mediated reduction PPARbeta/delta binding activity H9c2 cardiac cells. results suggest LPS-mediated NF-kappaB activation inhibits expression genes involved fatty acid metabolism mechanism involving reduced expression PGC-1, turn affects PPARbeta/delta transactivation target genes involved cardiac fatty acid oxidation.
