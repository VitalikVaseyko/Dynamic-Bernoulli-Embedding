 Objective: MET member receptor tyrosine kinases. Several MET-targeting inhibitors antagonistic antibodies shown promising data clinical trials lung adenocarcinoma. Finding noninvasive diagnostic tools estimate status MET helpful clinical practice. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) used routinely diagnosis staging tumors. However, relationship MET expression (18)F-FDG uptake investigated yet. study aimed determine correlation MET expression (18)F-FDG uptake PET-CT scan whether (18)F-FDG PET/CT used predict MET status lung adenocarcinoma patients. Patients methods: Fifty-seven lung adenocarcinoma patients analyzed study. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) calculated PET/CT images. expression levels MET two important glycolysis-related markers, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) pyruvate kinase M2, analyzed immunohistochemistry tissues. Spearman rank correlation used analyze association MET expression SUVmax. vitro MET knockdown lung adenocarcinoma cells used examine role MET tumor metabolism. effect MET GLUT1 expression investigated using Western blot assay quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: SUVmax positively correlated expression levels MET (r=0.458; P<0.001) GLUT1 (r=0.551; P<0.001). SUVmax significantly higher patients positive MET expression negative MET expression (9.92+/-6.62 vs 4.60+/-3.00; P=0.002). MET knockdown lung adenocarcinoma cells led significant decrease GLUT1 expression (18)F-FDG uptake. Conclusion: MET could increase (18)F-FDG uptake upregulating GLUT1 expression. (18)F-FDG PET/CT could used predict MET status lung adenocarcinoma patients supply valuable information guide targeted therapy.
