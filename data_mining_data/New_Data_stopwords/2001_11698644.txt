 Recently purified identified previously uncharacterized transcription factor rat liver binding carbohydrate responsive element L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. factor named carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP). ChREBP, essential L-PK gene transcription, activated high glucose inhibited cAMP. Here, demonstrated (i) nuclear localization signal basic helix-loop-helix/leucine-zipper domains ChREBP essential transcription, (ii) domains targets regulation cAMP glucose. Among three cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, Ser(196) Thr(666) target sites. Phosphorylation former resulted inactivation nuclear import, latter resulted loss DNA-binding activity L-PK transcription. hand, glucose activated nuclear import dephosphorylation Ser(196) cytoplasm also stimulated DNA-binding activity dephosphorylation Thr(666) nucleus. results thus reveal mechanisms regulation ChREBP L-PK transcription excess carbohydrate cAMP.
