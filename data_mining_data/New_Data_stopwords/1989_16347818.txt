 Acetyl coenzyme (acetyl-CoA) synthetase acetate kinase localized within soluble portion Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids, appreciable activity found elsewhere nodule. presence acetate-activating enzyme confirmed separation two enzyme activities hydroxylapatite column, substrate dependence enzyme forward reverse directions, substrate specificity, inhibition patterns, also identification reaction products C(18) reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Phosphotransacetylase activity, found soluble portion bacteroid, dependent presence potassium inhibited added sodium. greatest acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity found root nodule cytosol, although appreciable activity also found within bacteroids. combined specific activities acetyl-CoA synthetase acetate kinase-phosphotransacetylase approximate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thus providing B. japonicum sufficient capacity generate acetyl-CoA.
