 metabolic actions porcine insulin biosynthetic human proinsulin fatty acid glucose metabolism studied rat hepatocytes cultured monolayer 24 h. aim establish whether proinsulin action liver similar insulin action whether relative potencies two hormones different metabolic processes. Proinsulin insulin exerted similar maximal inhibitory effect ketone body formation palmitate gluconeogenesis pyruvate. half-maximal effective concentration proinsulin 11-13 times insulin. antiketogenic effects insulin proinsulin associated increased glycerol 3-phosphate content decreased affinity carnitine palmitoyltransferase substrate palmitoyl-CoA. basal rate ketogenesis increased isobutyl methylxanthine, half-maximal effective concentrations proinsulin insulin decreased, relative potency two hormones unchanged. Proinsulin insulin exerted similar maximal stimulatory effects glycogen synthesis activities pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme. half-maximal effective concentration proinsulin 10-30 times insulin. findings consistent receptor binding studies liver membranes suggest proinsulin interacts insulin-specific proinsulin-specific receptors. findings also suggest proinsulin action differ insulin action postreceptor site.
