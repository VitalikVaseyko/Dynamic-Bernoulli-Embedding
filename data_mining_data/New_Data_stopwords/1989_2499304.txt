 hyperinsulinaemic-glucose-clamp technique, combination measurement glucose turnover conscious unrestrained rats, used assess effects nutritional status insulin sensitivity vivo glucose metabolism. Liver, heart quadriceps skeletal-muscle glycogen content activities pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) glycogen synthase measured basally end 2.5 h glucose clamp (insulin 85 munits/h) rats 6, 24 48 h food withdrawal. Clamp glucose requirement glucose turnover unchanged fasting. Activation glycogen synthase glycogen deposition liver skeletal muscle clamps also impaired rats prolonged fast. contrast skeletal muscle, activation cardiac-muscle glycogen synthase glycogen deposition clamps markedly impaired 24 h fasting undetectable 48 h. Skeletal-muscle PDH activity fell prolonged fasting (6 h, 15.3 +/- 3.4%; 24 h, 4.7 +/- 0.7%; 48 h, 4.3 +/- 0.6% active; P less 0.005), 24 48 h stimulated clamp values unchanged duration fasting. Stimulation cardiac PDH activity clamp was, however, impaired rats fasted 24 48 h. Basal hepatic PDH change significantly fasting (6 h, 5.3 +/- 1.1%; 24 h, 4.6 +/- 0.7%; 48 h, 3.9 +/- 0.5%), and, although could partly restored 24 h, little stimulation occurred 48 h. Hepatic pyruvate kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity stimulated clamps, impaired prolonged fasting. glucose clamps, blood concentrations lactate, pyruvate alanine increased greater extent rats fasted 24 48 h rats studied 6 h food withdrawal. findings suggest that, although sensitivity insulin whole-body glucose disposal unchanged fasting, may qualitative differences metabolism glucose.
