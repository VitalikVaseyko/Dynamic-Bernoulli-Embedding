 Treatment isolated rat hepatocytes saturating concentrations glucagon caused several modifications properties pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40): S0.5 (substrate concentration half maximum velocity) phosphoenolpyruvate doubled, whereas Vmax changed; activity measured 0.15 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (physiological concentration) reduced 65-80%; also increase Hill coefficient affinity enzyme inhibitors Mg-ATP alanine. Glucagon, 3':5'-cyclic AMP, epinephrine caused inactivation pyruvate kinase together sitmulation gluconeogenesis. Insulin (10 nM) antagonized effect suboptimal doses glucagon cyclic AMP even maximal doses epinephrine, pyruvate kinase activity gluconeogenesis. observations explained phosphorylation pyruvate kinase cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, described Ljungstrom et al. [(1974) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 358, 289-298] reconstructed system. offer molecular explanation hormonal control gluconeogenesis. Glucose caused inhibition gluconeogenesis corresponding change pyruvate kinase activity.
