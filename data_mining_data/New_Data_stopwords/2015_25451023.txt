 Cardiac hypertrophy myocardial infarction (MI) two etiologically different disease forms varied pathological characteristics. However, precise molecular mechanisms specific causal proteins associated diseases obscure date. study, comparative cardiac proteome profiling performed Wistar rat models diseased control (sham) groups using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Proteins identified using Protein Pilot software (version 4.0) subjected stringent statistical analysis. Alteration key proteins validated Western blot analysis. differentially expressed protein sets identified study associated different functional groups, involving various metabolic pathways, stress responses, cytoskeletal organization, apoptotic signaling miscellaneous functions. deciphered altered energy metabolism hypertrophy comparison MI may predominantly attributed induced glucose oxidation level, via reduced phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta (PDHE1-B) protein hypertrophy. study reports first time global changes rat cardiac proteome two etiologically different cardiac diseases identifies key signaling regulators modulating ontogeny two diseases culminating heart failure. study also pointed toward differential activation PDHE1-B accounts upregulation glucose oxidation hypertrophy. Downstream analysis altered proteome associated modulators would enhance present knowledge regarding altered pathophysiology two etiologically different cardiac disease forms.
