 Cancer cells predominantly metabolize glucose glycolysis produce energy order meet metabolic requirement, phenomenon known Warburg effect. Although Warburg effect considered peculiarity critical survival proliferation cancer cells, regulatory mechanisms behind phenomenon remain incompletely understood. report eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K), negative regulator protein synthesis, critical role promoting glycolysis cancer cells. showed deficiency eEF-2K significantly reduced uptake glucose decreased productions lactate adenosine triphosphate tumor cells Ras-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts. demonstrated promotive effect eEF-2K glycolysis resulted kinase-mediated restriction synthesis protein phosphatase 2A-A (PP2A-A), key factor facilitates ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation c-Myc protein, knockdown eEF-2K expression led significant increase PP2A-A protein synthesis remarkable downregulation c-Myc pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, key glycolytic enzyme transcriptionally activated c-Myc. addition, depletion eEF-2K reduced ability transformed cells proliferate enhanced sensitivity tumor cells chemotherapy vitro vivo. results, uncover role eEF-2K-mediated control PP2A-A tumor cell glycolysis, provide new insights regulation Warburg effect.
