 Staphylococcus aureus, natural inhabitant nasopharyngeal tract, survives mainly biofilms. Previously observed S. aureus ATCC 12600 grown anaerobic conditions exhibited high rate biofilm formation L-lactate dehydrogenase activity. Thus, concentration pyruvate plays critical role S. aureus, primarily catalyzed pyruvate kinase (PK). Analyses PK gene sequence (JN645815) revealed presence PknB site PK gene indicating phosphorylation may influencing functioning PK. establish hypothesis pure enzymes S. aureus ATCC 12600 obtained expressing genes PK 1 PV 1 (JN695616) clones passing cytosolic fractions nickel metal chelate column. molecular weights pure recombinant PK PknB 63 73 kDa, respectively. enzyme kinetics pure PK showed K 0.69 +/- 0.02 microM, K PknB stpks (stpks = NLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAK) substrate 0.720 +/- 0.08 mM 0.380 +/- 0.07 mM autophosphorylation. phosphorylated PK exhibited 40 % reduced activity (PK = 0.2 +/- 0.015 muM NADH/min/ml P-PK = 0.12 +/- 0.01 muM NADH/min/ml). Elevated synthesis pyruvate kinase observed S. aureus ATCC 12600 grown anaerobic conditions suggesting formed pyruvate utilized synthesis phase, supporting increased rate biofilm formation.
