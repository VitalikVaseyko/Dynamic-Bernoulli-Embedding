 Transfusion-induced hemochromatosis major complication therapy severe chronic anemia. Improvement transfused cell survival reduction transfusion frequency one possible approach problem. Using continuous-flow centrifugation (CFC), young red blood cells (YRBC) enhanced vivo survival isolated, expense donor time required technique prohibit widespread use patient support. studied use IBM 2991 cell washer (CW) isolate YRBC ex vivo previously collected donor blood. Age-dependent red cell separation could achieved using instrumentation. Autologous mean red cell half-life (RBC-T50) (n = 9) younger cell fractions 43.9 +/- 7.8 days compared 34.7 +/- 5.8 days older cell fractions (n = 6, p less 0.05). Paired measurement RBC-T50 young old fractions three donors showed average survival increase 41% YRBC. Adequate quantities YRBC enhanced survival obtained less cost less donor stress using CW system compared CFC. approach could improve management patients chronic transfusion requirements merits examination.
