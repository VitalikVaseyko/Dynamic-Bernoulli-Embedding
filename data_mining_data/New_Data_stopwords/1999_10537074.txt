 Early events hypoxia-induced response trigger tyrosine phosphorylation cascades involving large number enzymes substrates. resolving power advanced two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed immunoblotting specific antibodies phosphotyrosine, used analyze hypoxia-induced modifications guinea pig brain synaptosomes. procedures, conjunction computer-aided image analysis, useful differential display gene products, providing comparison level posttranslationally modified products. Studies performed cerebral cortical synaptosomes three normoxic three hypoxic newborn guinea pigs. filter background noise consisting nonreproducible migrating protein spots, reproducible features electrophoretic patterns considered. Immunoreactivity patterns obtained anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies proved different normoxic hypoxic synaptosomes: total 130 immunoreactive spots, 49 tyrosine-phosphorylated hypoxic synaptosomes 20 normoxic ones only. data suggest hypoxia extensively remodels signaling pathway switching tyrosine phosphorylation cellular components (i.e., alpha-internexin) switching tyrosine phosphorylation proteins (i.e., heat shock cognate 70, aconitase, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, pyruvate kinase).
