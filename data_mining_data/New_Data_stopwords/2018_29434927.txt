 Pancreatic cancer one highest mortality rates cancer types. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) multifunctional protein homodimer convert acetyl coenzyme (CoA) malonyl-CoA palmitate, thus regulating lipogenesis. FASN overexpression also shown cause resistance gemcitabine, chemotherapy treatment pancreatic cancer; however, mechanism happens unclear. Analysis gene expression FASN pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) pancreatic cancer performed using Oncomine microarray gene expression datasets, demonstrated FASN PKM2 upregulated pancreatic cancer compared normal tissue. Specifically, demonstrated FASN enabled upregulation PKM2 expression mRNA protein levels, increasing glucose consumption rate pancreatic cancer cells. present study also revealed decreased levels FASN reduced resistance gemcitabine treatment, induced PKM2 overexpression pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, FASN may represent novel therapeutic target pancreatic cancer.
