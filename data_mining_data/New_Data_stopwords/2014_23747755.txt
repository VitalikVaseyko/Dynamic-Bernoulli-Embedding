 BACKGROUND & AIMS: Proliferation liver progenitor cells (LPCs) associated inflammation fibrosis chronic liver diseases. However, inflammation fibrosis affect LPCs remains obscure. METHODS: examined role interferon (IFN)-gamma, important pro-inflammatory anti-fibrotic cytokine, LPC expansion HBV-infected patients mice challenged 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)- choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet well primary LPCs LPC cell line. RESULTS: CK19 staining scores correlated inflammation fibrosis grades livers 110 HBV-infected patients. Nine-month IFN-gamma treatment decreased LPC numbers, inflammation, fibrosis HBV-infected patients. Similarly, two-week IFN-gamma treatment also decreased LPC activation DDC-treated mice. Disruption IFN-gamma signaling components (e.g., IFNGR, STAT1, IRF-1) increased LPC proliferation liver fibrosis DDC-fed mice. contrast, deletion IFN-gamma increase, rather slightly reduced LPC proliferation CDE-fed mice. vitro, IFN-gamma attenuated proliferation LPC cell line BMOL primary LPCs wild type mice, STAT1(-/-) IRF-1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, co-culture assays suggest IFN-gamma indirectly promote LPC proliferation via activation macrophages attenuate via inhibition hepatic stellate cells. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma inhibits LPC expansion via direct inhibition LPC proliferation indirect attenuation liver fibrosis DDC model, may also enhance LPC expansion via promotion inflammation CDE model; thereby playing dual roles regulating LPC proliferation vivo.
