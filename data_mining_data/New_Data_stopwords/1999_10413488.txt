 Site-directed mutagenesis used change Lys 240 yeast pyruvate kinase (Lys 269 muscle PK) Met. K240M absolute requirement FBP catalysis. K240M 100- 1000-fold less active wild-type YPK presence Mn(2+) Mg(2+), respectively. Steady-state fluorescence titration data suggest substrate PEP binds K240M affinity wild-type YPK. rate phosphoryl transfer K240M decreased >1000-fold compared wild-type YPK. detritiation 3-[(3)H]pyruvate catalyzed YPK occurs rate significantly greater spontaneous rate. Detritiation pyruvate wild-type YPK occurs divalent metal- FBP-dependent process requiring ATP. detectable detritiation pyruvate catalyzed K240M. solvent deuterium isotope effect k(cat) 2.7 +/- 0.2 1.6 +/- 0.1 wild type K240M YPK, respectively. suggests isotope sensitive step PK reaction involve Lys 240 enolpyruvate intermediate still protonated K240M. Isotope trapping used characterize enolpyruvate protonation K240M. enrichment methyl protons pyruvate labeled solvent formed catalysis muscle PK wild-type YPK, background levels tritium trapped K240M. K240M, proton donor exchanges protons solvent higher rate relative turnover proton donor wild-type YPK. pH-rate profile K240M exhibits loss pK(a) value 8. 8 observed wild-type YPK. data recent crystal structure data suggest Lys 240 interacts phosphoryl group phosphoenolpyruvate helps stabilize pentavalent phosphate transition state phosphoryl transfer. Phosphoryl transfer highly coupled proton transfer, Lys 240 also affects enolate protonation.
