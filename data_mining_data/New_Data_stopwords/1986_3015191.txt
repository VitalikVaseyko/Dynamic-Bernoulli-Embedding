 Since pyrimidine nucleotides avidly bind magnesium, tested hypothesis haemolytic anaemia hereditary pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) deficiency due state functional magnesium depletion red cell (RBC). haemolysates normal subjects, cytidine triphosphate (CTP) inhibited activity pyruvate kinase competitive manner magnesium. CTP Ki 0.4 mmol/l. CTP inhibited activity hexokinase competitive manner ATP (Mg-ATP2-) Ki 4 mmol/l. inhibitory effect CTP enzymes overcome increasing magnesium content test system. Since CTP appeared inhibit enzymes required magnesium cofactor Mg-ATP2- substrate, tested effect exogenous magnesium metabolism P5N deficient RBC. autohaemolysis test, incubated Heinz body assay rate glucose oxidation pentose phosphate shunt abnormal intact RBC patient hereditary P5N deficiency. addition MgCl2 (6-10 mmol/l) improve abnormal vitro measures metabolism P5N deficient RBC. lack effect exogenous magnesium may due slow uptake magnesium human RBC.
