 Astrocytes cope readily hypoxic insults neurons. hypothesized astrocytes upregulate glycolytic capacity, allowing anaerobic glycolysis provide sufficient ATP cell survival well carrying critical functions taking glutamate. test hypothesis, astrocytes subjected hypoxia 5 hr. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) pyruvate kinase activities increased 3- 4-fold. Examination LDH isoenzyme patterns determined anaerobic isoenzymes upregulated. determine whether increase enzyme activity translates increased glycolytic capacity, astrocytes subjected varying time periods hypoxia, glucose uptake measured conditions astrocytes forced consume ATP. demonstrated 8 hr hypoxia resulted doubling glycolytic capacity. suggest quickly astrocytes upregulate glycolytic capacity may determine whether neurons within stroke penumbra survive.
