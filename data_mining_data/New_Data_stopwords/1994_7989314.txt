 transition aerobic anaerobic metabolism occurs mitogen-activated thymocytes undergo proliferation. Glucose utilization lactate formation increases 18- 38-fold, respectively, proliferation. absolute amount 14CO2 production pyruvate dehydrogenase remains constant, 14CO2 production tricarboxylic acid cycle reduced transition resting proliferating state. Addition 2,4-dinitrophenol, agent uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, phenacinemethosulfate, electron acceptor, provide evidence reduction glucose oxidation proliferating thymocytes caused neither limitation tricarboxylic acid cycle insufficient supply ADP. data suggest enhanced cytosolic regeneration NAD+ induction glycolytic enzymes proliferation effectively competes NADH transport subsequent oxidation mitochondria. Mitogen-stimulated rat thymocytes cultured conventional medium containing glucose induce glycolytic enzymes 8-10-fold phase cell cycle divide within culture period 72 h. Replacement glucose glutamine, glutamine ribose, glutamine uridine prevents glycolytic enzyme induction thymocyte proliferation. effect glucose glycolytic enzyme induction cannot mimicked 3-O-methylglucose 2-deoxyglucose. conclusion, glucose required proliferation glycolytic enzyme induction mediates transition oxidative glycolytic energy production G1/S transition rat thymocytes.
