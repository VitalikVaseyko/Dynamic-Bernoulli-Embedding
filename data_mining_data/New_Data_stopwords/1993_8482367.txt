 Protein phosphorylation [gamma-32P]ATP total extract subfractions bovine heart mitochondria studied. results show that, addition pyruvate dehydrogenase, three mitochondrial proteins, molecular weights 44,000, 39,000 31,000 Da, phosphorylated cAMP-independent mitochondrial protein kinase. Three proteins associated mitochondria, molecular weights 125,000, 19,000 6,500 Da, phosphorylated cytoplasmic cAMP-dependent protein kinase (kinase A).
