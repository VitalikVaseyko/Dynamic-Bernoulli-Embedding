 Otto Warburg's theory origins cancer postulates tumor cells defects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation therefore rely high levels aerobic glycolysis major source ATP fuel cellular proliferation (the Warburg effect). contrast normal cells, primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation growth survival. report major function glucose metabolism Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth, hallmark transformed cells, support pentose phosphate pathway. major function glycolytic ATP support growth hypoxic conditions. Glutamine conversion tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate glutaminase alanine aminotransferase essential Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth. Mitochondrial metabolism allows generation reactive oxygen species (ROS) required Kras-induced anchorage-independent growth regulation ERK MAPK signaling pathway. show major source ROS generation required anchorage-independent growth Q(o) site mitochondrial complex III. Furthermore, disruption mitochondrial function loss mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) gene reduced tumorigenesis oncogenic Kras-driven mouse model lung cancer. results demonstrate mitochondrial metabolism mitochondrial ROS generation essential Kras-induced cell proliferation tumorigenesis.
