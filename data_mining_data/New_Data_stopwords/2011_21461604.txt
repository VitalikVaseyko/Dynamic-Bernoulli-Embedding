 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) negative regulator mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC), plays key role intermediary metabolism. study, 1,490-bp PDK Brassica napus (BnPDK1) isolated cloned Brassica cDNA library. BnPDK1 1,104 open reading frame encoding 367 amino acids. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis result indicated BnPDK1 multi-copy gene. RNA gel blot analysis RNA situ hybridization used determine expression BnPDK1 different organs. BnPDK1 gene ubiquitously expressed almost tissues tested, highest expression stamen young silique. Over-expression BnPDK1 transgenic Arabidopsis lines would repress PDC activity, resulted decrease seed oil content leaf photosynthesis. results implied BnPDK1 involved regulation fatty acid biosynthesis developing seeds.
