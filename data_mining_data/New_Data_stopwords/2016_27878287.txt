 Tumor cells prefer glycolysis (Warburg effect) proliferation metastasis. precise mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, demonstrated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) critical enzyme functioned oncogene promote non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) growth metastasis. discovered PDK1 expression significantly upregulated NSCLC tissues correlated advanced stage. Moreover, high expression PDK1 independent prognostic factor NSCLC. Ectopic overexpression PDK1 promoted cell proliferation inhibited apoptosis. Also shown PDK1 increased cell mobility Transwell assay performed. experiments indicated PDK1 central role metabolic reprogramming phosphorylating pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading enhanced Warburg effect. Collectively, data reveal new function PDK1, could used indicate prognosis NSCLC, provide targeted therapeutic strategy clinical treatment.
