 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) one factors contributed neurotoxicity amyloid beta (Abeta), causative protein Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 receptor prostaglandin D(2) (DP2) peroxysome-proliferator activated receptorgamma (PPARgamma) identified membrane receptor nuclear receptor 15d-PGJ(2), respectively. Previously, reported cytotoxicity 15d-PGJ(2) independent DP2 PPARgamma, suggested 15d-PGJ(2) induced apoptosis novel specific binding sites 15d-PGJ(2) different DP2 PPARgamma. relate cytotoxicity 15d-PGJ(2) amyloidoses, performed binding assay [(3)H]15d-PGJ(2) specified targets 15d-PGJ(2) associated cytotoxicity. various cell lines, close correlation susceptibilities 15d-PGJ(2) fibrillar Abeta. Specific binding sites [(3)H]15d-PGJ(2) detected rat cortical neurons human bronchial smooth muscle cells. binding assay performed subcellular fractions neurons, specific binding sites [(3)H]15d-PGJ(2) detected plasma membrane, nuclear cytosol, microsome. proteomic approach used identify protein targets 15d-PGJ(2) plasma membrane. using biotinylated 15d-PGJ(2), eleven proteins identified biotin-positive spots classified three different functional proteins: glycolytic enzymes (Enolase2, pyruvate kinase M1 (PKM1) glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)), molecular chaperones (heat shock protein 8 T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha), cytoskeletal proteins (Actin beta, F-actin-capping protein, Tubulin beta Internexin alpha). GAPDH, PKM1 Tubulin beta Abeta-interacting proteins. Thus, present study suggested 15d-PGJ(2) plays important role amyloidoses central nervous system also peripheral tissues.
