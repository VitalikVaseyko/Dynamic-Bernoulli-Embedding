 liver, (13)CO2 generated [1-(13)C] pyruvate via pyruvate dehydrogenase anaplerotic entry pyruvate TCA cycle followed decarboxylation phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. purpose study determine relative importance pathways production hyperpolarized (HP) (13)CO2 administration hyper-polarized pyruvate livers supplied fatty acid plus substrates gluconeogenesis. Isolated mouse livers perfused mixture thermally-polarized (13)C-enriched pyruvate, lactate octanoate various combinations prior exposure HP pyruvate. perfusion conditions, HP malate, aspartate fumarate detected within ~ 3 showing HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate rapidly converted [1-(13)C]oxaloacetate subsequently produce HP (13)CO2 via decarboxylation PEPCK. Measurements using HP [2-(13)C]pyruvate allowed exclusion reactions related TCA cycle turnover sources HP (13)CO2. Direct measures O2 consumption, ketone production, glucose production intact liver combined (13)C isotopomer analyses tissue extracts yielded comprehensive profile metabolic flux perfused liver. Together, data show that, even though majority HP (13)CO2 derived HP [1-(13)C]pyruvate livers exposed fatty acids reflects decarboxylation [4-(13)C]oxaloacetate (PEPCK) [4-(13)C]malate (malic enzyme), intensity HP (13)CO2 signal proportional glucose production amount pyruvate returned TCA cycle via PEPCK pyruvate kinase variable, depending upon available substrates.
