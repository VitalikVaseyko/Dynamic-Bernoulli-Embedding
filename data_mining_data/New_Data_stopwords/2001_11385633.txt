 Glycerol small simple molecule produced breakdown glucose, proteins, pyruvate, triacylglycerols glycerolipid, well release dietary fats. increasing number observations show glycerol probably involved surprising variety physiopathologic mechanisms. Glycerol long known play fundamental roles several vital physiological processes, prokaryotes eukaryotes, important intermediate energy metabolism. Despite differences details operation, many mechanisms preserved throughout evolution, demonstrating fundamental importance. particular, glycerol control osmotic activity crystal formation act cryoprotective agent. Furthermore, properties make useful numerous industrial, therapeutic diagnostic applications. studies focussed directly glycerol, however, metabolism increasingly well documented, much details remain unknown. Considering importance glycerol multiple vital physiological processes, study could help unlock important physiopathological mechanisms.
