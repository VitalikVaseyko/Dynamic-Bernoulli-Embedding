 BACKGROUND: radio- chemotherapeutics currently used treatment cancer widely known characterized low therapeutic index. interesting approach overcoming limits techniques exploitation so-called Warburg effect, typically characterizes neoplastic cells. Interestingly, feature already utilized good results, diagnostic purposes (PET SPECT). pharmacological point view, drugs able perturb cancer cell metabolism, specifically level glycolysis, may display interesting therapeutic activities cancer. OBJECTIVE: pharmacological actions glycolytic enzyme inhibitors, based primarily ATP depletion, could include: i) amelioration drug selectivity exploiting particular glycolysis addiction cancer cell; ii) inhibition energetic anabolic processes; iii) reduction hypoxia-linked cancer-cell resistance; iv) reduction ATP-dependent multi-drug resistance; v) cytotoxic synergism conventional cancer treatments. CONCLUSION: Several glycolytic inhibitors currently preclinical clinical development. clinical value anticancer agents, terms therapeutic index, strictly depends careful reevaluation pathophyiological role unique metabolism cancer cells general Warburg effect particular.
