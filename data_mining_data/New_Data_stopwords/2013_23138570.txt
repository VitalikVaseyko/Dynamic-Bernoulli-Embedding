 Induction HIF-1alpha oxygen limitation promotes increased phosphorylation catalytic depression mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enhanced glycolytic poise cells. Cobalt chloride desferrioxamine widely used mimics hypoxia increase levels HIF-1alpha. evaluated ability agents elicit selected physiological responses hypoxia means metabolically precondition mammalian cells, without detrimental effects hypoxia. show that, CoCl(2) increase HIF-1alpha dose-dependent manner, unexpectedly strikingly decreases PDH phosphorylation E1alpha sites 1, 2, 3 (Ser(293), Ser(300), Ser(232), respectively) HepG2 cells. effect also observed site 1 mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts J774 macrophages. CoCl(2) unexpectedly decreases mRNA expression PDH kinase-2 HepG2 cells, likely explains dephosphorylation PDH observed. desferrioxamine promote expected increase PDH phosphorylation. Dimethyloxaloylglycine (a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor) performs better regard, failed promote stronger effects seen hypoxia. Consequently, CoCl(2) desferrioxamine unreliable mimics hypoxia physiological events downstream HIF-1alpha stabilization. study demonstrates mimetic chemicals must chosen caution evaluated thoroughly bona fide cellular outcomes promoted fidelity.
