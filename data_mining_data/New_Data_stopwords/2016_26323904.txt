 OBJECTIVE: purpose study evaluate value tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer. METHODS: diagnosis clinical studies tumor M2-PK diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer electronic researched Medline, EMBASE, WANFANG, CNIK databases. data true positive, false positive, false negative, true negative extracted individual studies. use Stata11.0 (http://www.stata.com; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) MetaDiSc 1.4 software pool diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic area receiver operating characteristic (ROC). RESULTS: Eleven diagnostic clinical studies 1294 subjects included diagnostic meta-analysis. combined sensitivity, specificity, positive likely hood ratio, negative likely hood ratio 0.69 (0.65-0.72), 0.92 (0.89-0.94), 7.84 (5.92-10.38), 0.36 (0.32-0.40). area ROC curve 0.92 (0.90-0.94). CONCLUSION: Serum tumor M2-PK potential biomarker diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer.
