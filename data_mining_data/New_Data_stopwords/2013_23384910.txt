 OBJECTIVE: explore clinical significance genetic detection changes red cell enzyme activities pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase (P5'N), pyruvate kinase (PK) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) patients alpha-thalassaemia (alpha-thal). METHODS: Three alpha-thal patients processed gene detection PCR-trans-dot blot gap-PCR, red cell enzymes activities absorbance 260 280 nm (A) P5'N fluorescence spot test PK G-6-PD. RESULTS: Red cells 3 alpha-thal cases microcytic hypochromic obvious augmented target cells basophilic stippling erythrocytes. Two patients anemia, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia augmented LDH. HbH positively identified hemoglobin electrophoresis hemoglobin cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis; patient abnormalities. Genotypes 3 patients (-alpha(3.7)/--(SEA)), (alphaalpha(QS)/--(SEA))and (--(SEA)), respectively. activity P5'N (but PK G-6-PD) red cell reduced. CONCLUSIONS: first documented alpha-thal P5'N deficiency. Genetic detection might clinical significant diagnosis pedigree screening alpha-thal.
