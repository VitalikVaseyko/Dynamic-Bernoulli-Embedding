 Selected aspects metabolism Plasmodium falciparum reviewed, conclusions based study species plasmodia intentionally included since may applicable. parasites increase glucose consumption 50-100 fold compared uninfected red cells; glucose metabolized lactic acid. parasite contains complete set glycolytic enzymes. enzymes hexokinase, enolase pyruvate kinase vastly increased corresponding levels uninfected red cells. However, pathway synthesizing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) absent. Parasitized red cells show decline concentration 2,3-DPG may function inhibitor certain essential enzyme pathways. Pentose shunt activity increased absolute terms, percent total glucose consumption, decrease parasite infection red cell. parasite contains gene G6PD produce small quantity parasite-encoded enzyme. clear production enzyme up-regulated G6PG deficient host red cells. NADPH normally produced pentose shunt obtained parasite pathways (such glutamate dehydrogenase). NADPH may subserve additional needs infected red cell driving diribonucleotide reductase activity--a rate limiting enzyme DNA synthesis. role NADPH protecting parasite-red cell system oxidative stress (via glutathione reduction) remains controversial. Parasitized red cells contain 10 times NAD(H) uninfected red cells, NADP(H) content unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
