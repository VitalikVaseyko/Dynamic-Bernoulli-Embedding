 Assay activities hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase showed first two declined aging human lens cortex three enzymes retained constant activities epithelium throughout life. Moreover, clear cataractous aging lenses contained enzyme activities. ATP contents cataracts, however, lower clear lenses; fact, incubation 37.5 degrees C isotonic (290 300 mOsm), glucose-containing media, ATP rapidly lost cataracts (but clear lenses), suggesting excessive ATP expenditure cataracts osmotic balance. Cataracts incubated media containing either glucose-6-phosphate fructose-1, 6-diphosphate produced significantly higher ATP glucose media, indicating glucose metabolism human senile cataracts could supplemented hexose phosphates. Fructose-1, 6-diphosphate appeared efficient glucose-6-phosphate preventing lens swelling incubation.
