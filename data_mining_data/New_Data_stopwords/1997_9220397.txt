 Identification human tissue contaminated cytomegalovirus currently carried PCR amplification followed measurement amplicons. Three luminescent detection systems undertaken sandwich hybridization amplicons compared. sandwich hybridization takes place covalent linked capture probe, bound onto plastic 96-well plate, biotinylated digoxigenin-labeled detection probe. three non-isotopic luminescent detection systems need either streptavidin-conjugated peroxydase streptavidin-conjugated pyruvate kinase antibodies conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Detection enzymes carried measurement light emission presence of, respectively, luminol peroxidase dioxethane alkaline phosphatase. kinase assay carried presence substrates, ADP phospho-enol pyruvate, also luciferase, converts produced ATP light. method found sensitive, luciferase bioluminescent assay production long lasting signal. Amplicons eight clinical samples detected combination sandwich hybridization three luminescent assays. results comparable nested PCR identification positive samples. correlation obtained 45 clinical samples using pyruvate kinase detection system. high performance assays given specificity sandwich hybridization combined sensitivity luminescent detection systems.
