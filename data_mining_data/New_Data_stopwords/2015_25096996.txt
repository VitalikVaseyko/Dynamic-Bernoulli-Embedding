 Drug resistance poses major challenge ovarian cancer treatment. Understanding mechanisms drug resistance important finding new therapeutic targets. present work, cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780-DR established resistance index 6.64. cellular accumulation cisplatin significantly reduced A2780-DR cells compared A2780 cells consistent general character drug resistance. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified 340 differentially expressed proteins A2780 A2780-DR cells, involve diverse cellular processes, including metabolic process, cellular component biogenesis, cellular processes, stress responses. Expression levels Ras-related proteins Rab 5C Rab 11B A2780-DR cells lower A2780 cells confirmed real-time quantitative PCR Western blotting. short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown Rab 5C A2780 cells resulted markedly increased resistance cisplatin whereas overexpression Rab 5C A2780-DR cells increases sensitivity cisplatin, demonstrating Rab 5C-dependent endocytosis plays important role cisplatin resistance. results also showed expressions glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 down-regulated drug resistant cells, indicating drug resistance ovarian cancer directly associated decrease glycolysis. Furthermore, found glutathione reductase up-regulated A2780-DR, whereas vimentin, HSP90, Annexin A1 A2 down-regulated. Taken together, results suggest drug resistance ovarian cancer cell line A2780 caused multifactorial traits, including down-regulation Rab 5C-dependent endocytosis cisplatin, glycolytic enzymes, vimentin, up-regulation antioxidant proteins, suggesting Rab 5C potential target treatment drug-resistant ovarian cancer. constitutes step toward comprehensive understanding drug resistance ovarian cancer.
