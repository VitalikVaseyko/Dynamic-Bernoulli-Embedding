 major nitrogenous osmolytes present cells marine invertebrates, notably free amino acids glycine, alanine proline, trimethylamine oxide betaine, highly compatible proper enzyme function structure. nitrogenous osmolytes display either non-perturbing or, cases, favorable effects enzyme-substrate enzyme-cofactor complex formation, catalytic velocity protein structural stability. contrast, inorganic salts (KCl NaCl) certain free amino acids play minor osmotic role, e.g., arginine lysine, strongly perturbing effects one enzymic parameters. compatible nitrogenous solutes therefore suitable use high (several tenths molar) concentrations widely varying concentrations osmo-conforming species. Certain nitrogenous solutes, especially trimethylamine oxide, betaine glutamate, offset perturbing effects inorganic ions enzyme function. selective accumulation osmolytes thus involves concentration non-perturbing solutes, also balanced accumulation solutes opposing effects enzymes. selection end-products anaerobic metabolism also appears based, part, considerations solute compatibility enzyme function. Octopine non-perturbing solute, whereas arginine, condensed pyruvate form octopine, strongly perturbing. Succinate marked stabilizing effects protein structure. conclude composition intracellular fluids marine invertebrates reflects selection osmolytes end-products whose net effects create cellular microenvironment conducive optimal enzyme function structure. accumulation compatible solutes may preclude necessity widespread changes protein structure adapting concentrated highly variable osmotic environments.
