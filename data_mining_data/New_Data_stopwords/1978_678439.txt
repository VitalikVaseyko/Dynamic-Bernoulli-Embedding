 Twelve enzymes related direct oxidative glycolytic pathways glucose metabolism assayed 88 cancers cervix 48 cancers endometrium human uterus, activities compared obtained group control tissues. Significant increases one enzymes studied (alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase) found cancer cervix, compared normal cervix epithelium. Hexokinase, phoshofructokinase, aldolase appear rate-limiting normal cervix epithelium; however, since increase activity first two cancers least glycolytic enzymes, redundant enzyme synthesis probably occurs malignant cell enzymes catalysing reversible reactions. virtually correlation activity enzyme measured cancer sample histological assessments degree malignancy tumour, clinical stage disease. enzymes except pyruvate kinase significantly higher activity normal endometrium normal cervix epithelium, presumably reflecting greater metabolic requirements former tissue. phosphoglucose isomerase pyruvate kinase significantly higher endometrial cancer normal endometrium, significant differences cancers cervix endometrium, despite marked differences tissues origin. results suggest changes occur malignant transformation activities regulatory enzymes catalysing reversible reactions, manner justifying conclusion general metabolism tumours convergent.
