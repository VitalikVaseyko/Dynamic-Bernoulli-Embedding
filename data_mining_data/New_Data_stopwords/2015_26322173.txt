 Aerobic glycolysis, i.e., Warburg effect, may contribute aggressive phenotype hepatocellular carcinoma. However, increasing evidence highlights limitations Warburg effect, high mitochondrial respiration low glycolysis rates cancer cells. explain contradictory phenomena regard Warburg effect, metabolic interplay glycolytic oxidative cells proposed, i.e., "reverse Warburg effect". Aerobic glycolysis may also occur stromal compartment surrounds tumor; thus, stromal cells feed cancer cells lactate interaction prevents creation acidic condition tumor microenvironment. concept provides great heterogeneity tumors, makes disease difficult cure using single agent. Understanding metabolic flexibility lactate shuttles offers new perspectives develop treatments target hypoxic tumor microenvironment overcome limitations glycolytic inhibitors.
