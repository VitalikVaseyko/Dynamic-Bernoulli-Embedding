 Methanococcus maripaludis, facultatively autotrophic archaebacterium grows H2 formate electron donor, assimilate sugars complex organic substrates. However, glycogen biosynthesized intracellularly commonly reaches values 0.34% cellular dry weight early stationary phase. determine pathway glycogen catabolism, specific enzymes sugar metabolism assayed cell extracts. following enzymes found (specific activity milliunits per milligram protein): glycogen phosphorylase, 4.4; phosphoglucomutase, 10; glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 9; 6-phosphofructokinase, 5.6, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, 10; fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, 4.2; triosephosphate isomerase, 44; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 26; phosphoglycerate kinase, 20; phosphoglycerate mutase, 78; enolase, 107; pyruvate kinase, 4.0. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase NADP+ dependent, pyruvate kinase required MnCl2. 6-phosphofructokinase unusually low pH optimum 6.0. Four nonoxidative pentose-biosynthetic enzymes found (specific activity milliunits per milligram protein): transketolase, 12; transaldolase, 24; ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase, 55; ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase, 100. However, key enzymes oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, reductive pentose phosphate pathway, classical modified Entner-Duodoroff pathways detected. Thus, glycogen appears catabolized Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. result striking contrast nonmethanogenic archaebacteria examined, among Entner-Doudoroff pathway common. dithiothreitol-specific NADP(+)-reducing activity also found (8.5 mU/mg protein). thiol compounds, cysteine hydrochloride, reduced glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, replace dithiothreitol activity. physiological significance activity known.
