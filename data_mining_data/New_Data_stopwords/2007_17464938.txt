 proteome survey MS analysis conducted investigate glucose metabolism Fusobacterium varium, butyrate-producing constituent indigenous human gut microflora. bacterium capable catabolizing glucose main energy source via Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. 2-DE analyses revealed apparent concentrations six identified glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase, enolase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) specifically increased response presence glucose chemically defined minimal growth medium, diminish medium additionally supplemented L-glutamate, amino acid readily fermented members Fusobacterium genus. substrate pool depletion study revealed sugar, amino acid, efficient growth substrate. proteomics substrate pool depletion studies revealed F. varium simultaneously utilize glucose L-glutamate energy sources. Enzymes involved L-glutamate metabolism also identified, including NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase two enzymes methylaspartate pathway L-glutamate catabolism (glutamate mutase methylaspartate ammonia-lyase). apparent intracellular concentrations elevated bacterium cultured media supplemented excess L-glutamate. observation apparent concentrations specific proteins elevated response particular growth substrate supplied energy source provides first evidence presence nutrient-responsive mechanism governing intracellular protein concentration F. varium.
