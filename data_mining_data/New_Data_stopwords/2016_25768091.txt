 Role of, 29-non-synonymous, 15-intronic, 3-close UTR, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 2 mutations Human Pyruvate Kinase (PK) M2 investigated in-silico in-vitro functional studies. Prediction deleterious substitutions based sequence homology structure based servers, SIFT, PANTHER, SNPs&GO, PhD-SNP, SNAP PolyPhen, depicted 19% emerged common mentioned programs. SNPeffect HOPE showed three substitutions (C31F, Q310P S437Y) in-silico deleterious functionally important. In-vitro activity assays showed C31F S437Y variants PKM2 reduced activity, Q310P variant catalytically inactive. allosteric activation due binding fructose 1-6 bisphosphate (FBP) compromised case S437Y nsSNP variant protein. corroborated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study, also carried two variant proteins. 5 intronic SNPs PKM2, associated sporadic breast cancer case-control study, subjected different computational analyses, indicated 3 SNPs (rs2856929, rs8192381 rs8192431) could generate alternative transcript influencing splicing factor binding PKM2. propose these, potentially functional important variations, within exons introns, could bearing cancer metabolism, since PKM2 implicated cancer recent past.
