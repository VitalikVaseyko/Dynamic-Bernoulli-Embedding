 effect methylguanidine guanidinosuccinic acid pyruvate kinase activity human red cells determined vitro following 3-hour incubation 37 degrees C. obtained results shown methylguanidine concentration 1.8 x 10(-5) M/l inhibits pyruvate kinase activity 20.8%. Pyruvate kinase activity statistically significantly inhibited addition methylguanidine concentration 5.4 x 10(-5) M/l whereas higher concentrations effect Guanidinesuccinic acid exerted similar weaker effect activity pyruvate kinase human red cells. Mixture methylguanidine (5.4 x 10(-5) m/l) guanidinesuccinic acid (2.8 x 10(-5) M/l) affect pyruvate kinase activity normal human red cells identical experimental conditions.
