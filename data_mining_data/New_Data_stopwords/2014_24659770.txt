 carbon sources become limiting growth, bacteria must choose remaining nutrients used first. identified nutrient-sensing signaling network Escherichia coli activated transition stationary phase. network composed two histidine kinase/response regulator systems YehU/YehT YpdA/YpdB target proteins, YjiY YhjX (both membrane-integrated transporters). peptide/amino acid-responsive YehU/YehT system found negative effect expression target gene, yhjX, pyruvate-responsive YpdA/YpdB system, YpdA/YpdB system stimulated expression yjiY, target YehU/YehT system. effects confirmed mutants lacking genes three primary components either system. Furthermore, vivo interaction assay based bacterial adenylate cyclase detected heteromeric interactions membrane-bound components two systems, specifically, two histidine kinases two transporters, compatible formation larger signaling unit. Finally, carbon storage regulator (CsrA) shown involved posttranscriptional regulation yjiY yhjX.
