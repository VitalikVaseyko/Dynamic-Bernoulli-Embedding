 DAP-kinase (DAPK) Ca(2+)/calmodulin regulated Ser/Thr kinase activates diverse range cellular activities. subject multiple layers regulation involving intramolecular signaling, interactions additional proteins, including kinases phosphatases. protein stability modulated least three distinct ubiquitin-dependent systems. Like many kinases, DAPK participates several signaling cascades, phosphorylating additional kinases ZIP-kinase protein kinase (PKD), Pin1, phospho-directed peptidyl-prolyl isomerase regulates function many phosphorylated proteins. substrate targets direct cellular effects; example, phosphorylation myosin II regulatory chain tropomyosin mediate DAPK's cytoskeletal functions, including membrane blebbing cell death cell motility. DAPK induces distinct death pathways apoptosis, autophagy programmed necrosis. Among substrates implicated processes, phosphorylation PKD, Beclin 1, NMDA receptor reported. Interestingly, cellular effects mediated DAPK's catalytic activity. example, virtue protein-protein interactions alone, DAPK activates pyruvate kinase isoform M2, microtubule affinity regulating kinases inflammasome protein NLRP3, promote glycolysis, influence microtubule dynamics, enhance interleukin-1beta production, respectively. addition, number substrates interacting proteins identified, physiological significance yet established. substrates, effectors regulators together comprise DAPK interactome. presenting components interactome network, review clarify mechanisms DAPK function regulated, mediates various cellular effects.
