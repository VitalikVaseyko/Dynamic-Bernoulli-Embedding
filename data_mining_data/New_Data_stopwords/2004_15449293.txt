 article presents dynamic responses several intra- extracellular components aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture Saccharomyces cerevisiae glucose ethanol pulses within time window 75 sec. Even though ethanol pulse cannot perturb glycolytic pathway directly, distinct response metabolites lower part glycolysis found. suggest response indirect effect, caused perturbation NAD/NADH ratio, direct consequence conversion ethanol acetaldehyde. effect NAD/NADH ratio glycolysis might serve additional explanation observed decrease 3PG, 2PG, PEP glucose pulse. responses measured ethanol pulse used evaluate allosteric regulation glycolysis. results confirm FBP stimulates pyruvate kinase suggest effect pronounced. Furthermore, appears PEP play important role allosteric regulation phosphofructo kinase.
