 1. procedure isolating nuclei wheat germ non-aqueous media described. 2. nuclei shown constitute 50 per cent protoplasmic mass ribonucleic acid content order equivalent cytoplasm. 3. Studies distribution enzymes-aldolase, phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase-have revealed nuclei vigorous sites glycolytic activity. 4. Analysis DPN content nuclei calf tissues-liver, pancreas, heart-pointed probability glycolytic activity characteristic common many nuclei. 5. significance glycolytic activity nuclear function discussed suggestive comparisons made two energy-yielding systems glycolytic oxidative phosphorylation.
