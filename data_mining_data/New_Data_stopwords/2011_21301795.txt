 1927, Otto Warburg coworkers reported increased uptake glucose production lactate tumors vivo compared normal tissues. phenomenon, known Warburg effect, recapitulated vitro cancer tissue slices exhibiting excessive lactate production even adequate oxygen. Warburg's vivo studies tumors suggest dependency tumors vivo glucose could exploited therapy, reduction arterial glucose half resulted four-fold reduction tumor fermentation. Recent work cancer metabolism indicates Warburg effect aerobic glycolysis contributes redox balance lipid synthesis, glycolysis insufficient sustain growing dividing cancer cell. regard, glutamine, contributes carbons tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, re-discovered essential bioenergetic anabolic substrate many cancer cell types. Could alterations cancer metabolism exploited therapy? Here, address question reviewing current concepts normal metabolism altered metabolism cancer cells specific emphasis molecular targets involved directly glycolysis glutamine metabolism.
