 Coupling ATP-generating ATP-consuming processes essential component cardiac bioenergetics responsible optimal myocardial function. Although number enzymatic systems implicated securing proper intracellular energy communication, integrative response failing myocardium determined far. Therefore, measured catalytic activities enzymes responsible communication ATP-generating ATP-consuming processes ventricular samples obtained normal dogs dogs tachycardia-induced heart failure. failing myocardium, phosphotransfer activities creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase pyruvate kinase, collectively deliver ATP remove ADP myofibrillar ATPases, depressed 30, 21, 44 20%, respectively, compared normal controls. activity hexokinase, enzyme directs phosphoryls glycolytic phosphotransfer pathway, unchanged. Also, activity glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, may shuttle inorganic phosphate ATPases ATP-synthases, affected heart failure. However, CO2-hydration activity carbonic anhydrase, together creatine kinase, presumed responsible removal protons ATPases, diminished 21%. enzymatic systems collectively required adequate delivery high-energy phosphoryl to, removal end-products from, cellular ATPases, cumulative deficit flux capacities may provide bioenergetic basis impaired contraction-relaxation failing heart.
