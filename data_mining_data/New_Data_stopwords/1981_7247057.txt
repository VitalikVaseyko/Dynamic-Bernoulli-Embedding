 Resting metabolic rate energy cost performing specific (light work load bicycle ergometer measured nine subjects susceptible malignant hyperpyrexia (MHS) nine control subjects, fasting following 600-kcal meal. Blood glucose, lactate, pyruvate serum triglycerides, thyroxine, cortisol, creatine kinase, growth hormone, calcium potassium levels rest immediately following exercise, fasting eating, measured. evidence increased heat production MHS subjects compared controls. MHS subjects, however, showed complete absence dietary-induced thermogenesis exercise. Compared controls, MHS subjects higher insulin levels essentially blood glucose values. Triglycerides MHS group rose steadily course experiment, whereas controls vary initial value. Lactate rise much exercise MHS group fall rest, pyruvate change resting fasting values, whereas controls rose steadily. Differences also found thyroxine cortisol levels MHS control groups. shunting blood away thermogenic tissue suggested mechanism absence diet-induced thermogenesis exercise MHS group possibility underlying abnormality cardiovascular (sympathetic) control mechanisms subjects discussed. biochemical abnormalities discussed relation previous biochemical data MHS humans pigs relation abolition dietary-induced thermogenesis.
