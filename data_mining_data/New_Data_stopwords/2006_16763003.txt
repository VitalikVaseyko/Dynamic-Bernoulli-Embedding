 study investigated molecular alterations underlying physiological adaptations starvation refeeding human skeletal muscle. Forty-eight hours' starvation reduced whole-body insulin sensitivity 42% produced marked changes expression key carbohydrate (CHO) regulatory genes proteins: SREBP1c hexokinase II (HKII) downregulated 2.5- 5-fold, respectively, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) upregulated 4-fold. responses dependent phosphorylation status Akt FOXO1. hand, starvation concomitant increase circulating free fatty acids upregulate expression transcription factors genes involved fat metabolism. Twenty-four hours' refeeding CHO-rich diet completely reversed changes PDK4, HKII SREBP1c expression human skeletal muscle failed fully restore whole-body insulin sensitivity. Thus, starvation healthy humans, unlike rodents, regulation fat metabolism require adaptive response transcriptional level, adaptive changes gene expression required switch oxidative glucose disposal. Lack effect key proteins insulin-signalling pathway may indicate changes intracellular substrate availability/flux may responsible adaptive changes glucose metabolism. may represent important aspect molecular basis development insulin resistance metabolic conditions characterized energy restriction.
