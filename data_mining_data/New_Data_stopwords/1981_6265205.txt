 variations enzyme activities involved main pathways liver energetic metabolism--glycolysis, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis lipogenesis--have studied rats ranging age 4 days 21 months. major changes observed following: (1) enzymes involved glycolysis (pyruvate kinase) lipogenesis (NADP-malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase) decrease activity ageing, (2) gluconeogenic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase) maintained slightly increased period. results suggest increase capacity gluconeogenesis respect lipogenesis takes place aged rat liver.
