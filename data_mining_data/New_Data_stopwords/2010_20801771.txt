 OBJECTIVE: compare four faecal markers ability predict steroid refractoriness severe paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Construct validity responsiveness change also assessed. METHODS: prospective multicentre cohort study. Stool samples 101 children (13.3 + - 3.6 years; Pediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI) admission 72 + - 12 points) obtained third day intravenous steroid therapy. Repeated samples discharge obtained 24 children. Predictive validity assessed using diagnostic utility statistics predict steroid failure (ie, need salvage treatment). Concurrent validity assessed using correlational analysis following constructs: PUCAI, Lindgren Seo scores, physician's global assessment, albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate C-reactive protein (CRP). Responsiveness assessed using test utility correlational strategies. RESULTS: Median values (IQR) high baseline four markers (calprotectin 4215 microg/g (2297-8808); lactoferrin 212 microg/g (114-328); M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) 363 U/g (119-3104); S100A12 469 microg/g (193-1112)). M2-PK numerically superior three markers CRP predicting response corticosteroid treatment (area receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.64 0.85; p<0.001) vs <0.65 others). However, add predictive ability PUCAI (area ROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 0.89)). M2-PK also highest construct validity modest mean correlation constructs (r=0.3; p<0.05). None markers responsive change (Spearman's rho correlation change PUCAI <0.1; p>0.05, area ROC curve <0.65; p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: four markers greatly elevated severe paediatric UC. M2-PK good construct predictive validity, none responsive change. PUCAI, simple clinical index, performed better faecal markers predicting outcome following course intravenous corticosteroids severe UC.
