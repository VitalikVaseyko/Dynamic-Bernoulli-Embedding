 F172-8, H(+)-ATPase-defective mutant glutamic acid-producing bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 14067, exhibits enhanced rates glucose consumption respiration compared parental strain cultured biotin-rich medium glucose carbon source. conducted comparative proteomic analysis clarify mechanism enhanced glucose metabolism mutant established using proteome reference map strain ATCC 14067. comparison proteomes two strains revealed up-regulated expression several important enzymes pyruvate kinase (Pyk), malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo), malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) mutant. Pyk activates glycolysis response cellular energy shortages bacterium, increased expression may contribute enhanced glucose metabolism mutant. unique reoxidation system suggested NADH C. glutamicum consisting coupled reactions Mqo Mdh, together respiratory chain; therefore, enhanced expression enzymes might contribute reoxidation NADH increased respiration. proteomic analysis allowed identification unique physiological changes associated H(+)-ATPase defect F172-8 contributed understanding adaptations C. glutamicum energy deficiencies.
