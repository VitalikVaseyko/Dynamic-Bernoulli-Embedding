 Studies shown increased incorporation omega-3 fatty acids whole skeletal muscle following supplementation, although little done investigate potential impact fatty acid composition mitochondrial membranes functional consequences mitochondrial bioenergetics. Therefore, supplemented young healthy male subjects (n = 18) fish oils [2 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1 g docosahexanoic acid (DHA) per day] 12 weeks skeletal muscle biopsies taken prior (Pre) following (Post) supplementation analysis mitochondrial membrane phospholipid composition various assessments mitochondrial bioenergetics. Total EPA DHA content mitochondrial membranes increased (P < 0.05) approximately 450 approximately 320%, respectively, displaced omega-6 species several phospholipid populations. Mitochondrial respiration, determined permeabilized muscle fibres, demonstrated change maximal substrate-supported respiration, sensitivity (apparent Km) maximal capacity pyruvate-supported respiration. contrast, mitochondrial responses ADP titrations demonstrated enhanced ADP sensitivity (decreased apparent Km) independent creatine kinase shuttle. content ANT1, ANT2, subunits electron transport chain unaltered supplementation, data suggest prolonged omega-3 intake improves ADP kinetics human skeletal muscle mitochondria alterations membrane structure and/or post-translational modification ATP synthase ANT isoforms. Omega-3 supplementation also increased capacity mitochondrial reactive oxygen species emission without altering content oxidative products, suggesting absence oxidative damage. current data strongly emphasize role omega-3s reorganizing composition mitochondrial membranes promoting improvements ADP sensitivity.
