 UNLABELLED: study analyzes nitrated protein profile rat-brain cortex model hypoxia/reoxygenation, identifying nitrated proteins assessing spot changes. proteins identified grouped categories, according function: 1) metabolism: pyruvate kinase (PK), alpha-enolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), glutamine synthetase (GS); 2) cytoskeletal proteins: alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, gamma-actin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); 3) chaperones: heat-shock protein 71kDa (HSP71); 4) carrier proteins: voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC-1) Atp6v1a. PK, alpha-enolase, GS nitration rates upregulated, increasing progressively reoxygenation peaking 24h. GAPDH PGAM1 nitration levels fell hypoxia/reoxygenation. alpha-Tubulin, beta-tubulin, gamma-actin, GFAP nitration rates augmented 24h, diminished 5d. HSP71 suffered nitration immediately hypoxia, reoxygenation. VDAC-1 tyrosine nitration identified control group, whereas detectable Atp6v1a nitration levels observed immediately hypoxia. data deposited ProteomeXchange identifier PXD001049. findings suggest hypothetically crucial linkage nitration-related protein modifications metabolic cell-structure alterations. changes probably needed remodeling plasticity processes activated hypoxic brain response. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: first time spectrum nitrated proteins hypoxic brain well changes reoxygenation described. findings suggest hypothetically crucial linkage nitration-related protein modifications metabolic cell-structure alterations. changes probably needed remodeling plasticity processes activated hypoxic brain response. biological relevance findings linked important role developed signaling molecule hypoxic brain, could interpreted two different complementary ways: first, mechanism damage due nitration impacts key proteins affecting structure function; second, regulation mechanism involved hypoxic response. Hence, based modified proteins identified functions, would possible design new tools therapies prevent brain damage low-oxygen-pressure atmospheres.
