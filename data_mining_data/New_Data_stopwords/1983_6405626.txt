 investigated effects inhibiting spontaneous activity cultured rat myotubes several representative enzymes glycolytic oxidative metabolism. results presented demonstrate contractile activity absence nerves regulate amounts enzymes indicate muscle activity may partially control development metabolic types muscle fibers. Control muscle cells relatively high levels glycolytic enzymes low oxidative enzymes metabolically closely resemble fast glycolytic fibers. divalent cation ionophore A23187 caused enzyme levels cultured cells change towards found tonically contracting skeletal muscle fibers vivo. evidence presented suggests calcium may mediate certain effects associated muscle contraction enzymes energy metabolism.
