 Extensor digitorum longus muscles rats removed injected solution Marcaine plus hyaluronidase. incubation Marcaine solution 10 min, muscles grafted original beds. grafts contralateral control muscles removed rats 0, 1-5, 7, 11, 36, 69 days postoperatively. muscles frozen dry ice isopentane subsequently homogenized centrifuged. supernatant analyzed number enzymes, regenerative patterns classified 3 groups: (1) early increase activity: hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; (2) early decrease activity failure recover control levels: phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase; (3) early decrease followed return control levels: lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine phosphokinase, adenylate kinase. patterns identical reported embryogenesis muscle. data discussed regard correlative histological studies muscle regeneration.
