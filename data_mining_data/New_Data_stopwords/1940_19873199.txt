 1. effect oxygen evolution Chlorella vulgaris produced light intensities 40,000 f.-c. studied use Warburg technique. 2. certain critical intensity, determined previous history cells, rate oxygen evolution decreases maximum another constant rate. depression first completely reversible effect. 3. sufficiently high intensity constant rate represents oxygen uptake greater rate dark respiration. constant rate oxygen uptake progressive injury photosynthetic mechanism takes place. given oxygen consumption rate falls off, approaching zero, cells irreversibly injured. 4. constant rate oxygen evolution (2 3) decreases continuous manner increasing light intensities, approaching value approximately constant lots cells regardless previous history. 5. Two alternative hypotheses presented explain observed phenomena. acceptable proposes quick inactivation photosynthetic mechanism, extent inhibition depending light intensity. 6. Chlorella vulgaris solarization influenced previous history cells.
