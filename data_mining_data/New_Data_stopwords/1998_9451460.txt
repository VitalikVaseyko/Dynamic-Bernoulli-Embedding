 Red cells glycolytic enzymes attached nonattached K88+ Escherichia coli assayed. Hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione reductase activities, measured. E. coli K88ab fimbriae, E. coli K88ac fimbriae, isolated K88ab fimbriae investigated effect enzymes. Different changes obtained K88ab + bacteria compared K88ac + bacteria. Purified fimbriae gave third set responses.
