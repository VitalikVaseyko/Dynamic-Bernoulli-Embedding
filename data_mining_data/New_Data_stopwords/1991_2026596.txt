 effect insulin pyruvate dehydrogenase activity examined two different cell types expressed either normal defective human insulin receptors, RAT 1 embryonic fibroblasts Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Insulin stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity cells expressed normal insulin receptors (RAT 1 HIRc, CHO-WT CHO-T cells), receptors lysine 1018 ATP-binding site tyrosine kinase domain exchanged alanine (RAT 1 A/K1018 CHO-mut cells). rat hamster cell lines, insulin dose-response curves cells expressed mutant receptors identical appropriate controls expressed normal insulin receptors. Insulin failed stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity CHO-delta cells, expressed mutant human insulin receptor truncated 112 amino acids carboxyl terminal beta chain. Control studies verified cells used study exhibited expected phenotypes respect number insulin receptors expressed, insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity, biological consequences inactivating insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. findings show insulin receptor tyrosine kinase play obligatory role insulin signaling pathway stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
