 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) vascular remodeling disease characterized enhanced proliferation suppressed apoptosis pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). apoptosis resistance characterized PASMC mitochondrial hyperpolarization [in part, due decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity], decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), downregulation Kv1.5, increased [Ca(++)](i), activation transcription factor nuclear factor activated cells (NFAT). Inflammatory cells present within around remodeled arteries patients PAH elevated levels inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). hypothesized inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha inhibits PASMC PDH activity, inducing PAH phenotype normal PASMC. exposed normal human PASMC recombinant human TNFalpha measured PDH activity. TNFalpha-treated cells, PDH activity significantly decreased. Similar exogenous TNFalpha, endogenous TNFalpha secreted activated human CD8(+) cells, quiescent cells, caused mitochondrial hyperpolarization, decreased mROS, decreased K(+) current, increased [Ca(++)](i), activated NFAT normal human PASMC. TNFalpha antibody completely prevented, recombinant TNFalpha mimicked cell-induced effects. vivo, TNFalpha antagonist etanercept prevented reversed monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. separate model, cell deficient rats developed less severe MCT-induced PAH compared controls. show TNFalpha inhibit PASMC PDH activity induce PAH phenotype. work supports use anti-inflammatory therapies PAH.
