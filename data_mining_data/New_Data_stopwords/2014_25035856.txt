 Fibroblasts could considered connective tissue cells morphologically heterogeneous diverse functions depending location activity. cells play critical role health disease cancer wound Production collagen, fibronectin, cytokines growth factors. Absence insulin growth factors serum deprivation condition similarity condition environment tumor cells ulcer made us investigate anaerobic glycolysis cells. end, cultured fibroblasts isolated fresh human newborn foreskin serum free medium 16, 24, 48 72 hrs measured glucose consumption, lactate secretion intracellular LDH cells. results showed despite lack insulin, 16hr serum starved fibroblasts consumed glucose similar non-starved fibroblasts control. Moreover, condition cells secreted higher levels lactate exhibited higher levels intracellular LDH comparison non-starved fibroblasts control. Thus could concluded serum starvation condition, newborn human dermal fibroblasts may change metabolic strategy Warburg effect. finding opens new perspective understanding basic mechanisms involved communication tumor cells fibroblasts.
