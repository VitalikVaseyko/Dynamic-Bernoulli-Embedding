 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports infants children severe cardiopulmonary compromise. Nutritional support children includes provision medium- long-chain fatty acids (FAs). However, ECMO induces stress response, could limit capacity FA oxidation. Metabolic impairment could induce new exacerbate existing myocardial dysfunction. Using clinically relevant piglet model, tested hypothesis ECMO maintains myocardial capacity FA oxidation preserves myocardial energy state. Provision 13-Carbon labeled medium-chain FA (octanoate), long-chain free FAs (LCFAs), lactate systemic circulation showed ECMO promoted relative increases myocardial LCFA oxidation inhibiting lactate oxidation. Loading labeled substrates high dose left coronary artery demonstrated metabolic flexibility heart preferentially oxidized octanoate. ECMO preserved octanoate metabolic response, also promoted LCFA oxidation inhibited lactate utilization. Rapid upregulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) protein appeared participate metabolic shift ECMO. ECMO also increased relative flux lactate alanine supporting role pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition PDK4. High dose substrate loading ECMO also elevated myocardial energy state indexed phosphocreatine ATP ratio. ECMO promotes LCFA oxidation immature hearts, maintaining myocardial energy state. data support appropriateness FA provision ECMO support immature heart.
