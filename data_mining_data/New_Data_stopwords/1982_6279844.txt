 Several series N6- 8-substituted derivatives adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesized. N6-(omega-Aminoalkyl) derivatives adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) converted omega-N-carbobenzyloxy derivatives, converted, via 2',3'-O-carbonyl derivatives 5'-phosphorimidazolidates, corresponding ATP derivatives. Hydrogenolytic removal carbobenzyloxy groups, followed iodoacetylation omega-amino groups N-(iodoacetoxy)succinimide, gave N6-R-ATP, R = (CH2)nNHCOCH2I (n = 2--8) (CH2)nCON)CH3)(CH2)mN(CH3)CO(CH2)nNHCOCH2I (n = = 3; n = 3, = 4; n = 4, = 3; n = = 4). Condensation N6-(omega-aminoalkyl) derivatives AMP N-hydroxysuccinimide esters omega-[N-(carbobenzyloxy)amino] carboxylic acids gave N6-(CH2)nNHCO(CH2)mNH-Cbz derivatives AMP which, upon conversion corresponding derivatives ATP, followed removal carbobenzyloxy group iodoacetylation, described above, gave N6-(CH2)nNHCO(CH2)mNHCOCH2I-ATP derivatives (n = 3, = 5 6; n = 4, = 5; n = 6, = 1--6). sequence reactions starting N6-[omega-(methylamino)alkyl] derivatives N6-CH3-AMP gave N6-CH3, N6-(CH2)nH(CH3)CO(CH2)mNHCOCH2I derivatives ATP (n = 4, = 3, 5 6; n = 6, = 5 6). Reaction alpha, omega-diaminoalkanes 8-Br-ATP gave 8-NH(CH2)nNH2 derivatives ATP, upon iodoacetylation gave 8-NH(CH2)nNHCOCH2I derivatives ATP (n = 2, 4, 6, 8). Substrate inhibitor properties indicated ATP derivatives potential exco-ATP-site-directed inactivators hexokinases, adenylate kinases, pyruvate kinases.
