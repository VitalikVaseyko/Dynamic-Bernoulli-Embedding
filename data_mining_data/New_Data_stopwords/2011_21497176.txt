 Inefficiencies systemic drug delivery tumor residence well micro-environmental selection pressures contribute development multidrug resistance (MDR) cancer. Characteristics MDR include abnormal vasculature, regions hypoxia, up-regulation ABC-transporters, aerobic glycolysis, elevated apoptotic threshold. Nano-sized delivery vehicles ideal treating MDR cancer improve therapeutic index drugs engineered achieve multifunctional parameters. multifunctional ability nanocarriers makes adept treating heterogeneous tumor mass traditional chemotherapy. Nanocarriers also preferential tumor accumulation via EPR effect; accumulation enhanced actively targeting biological profile MDR cells. Perhaps significant benefit using nanocarrier drug delivery treat MDR cancer nanocarrier delivery diverts effects ABC-transporter mediated drug efflux; primary mechanism MDR. review discusses capabilities, applications, examples multifunctional nanocarriers treatment MDR. review emphasizes multifunctional nanocarriers enhance drug delivery efficiency, application RNAi, modulation tumor apoptotic threshold, physical approaches overcome MDR.
