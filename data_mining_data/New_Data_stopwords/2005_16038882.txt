 Oxidative stress characteristic cancerous colon tissue inflammatory bowel diseases increase colon cancer risk. Epidemiological evidence supports protective effect plant-derived compounds. Aspirin also protective colon cancer. mechanism action unclear although salicylic acid, main metabolite aspirin, shown decrease synthesis pro-inflammatory potentially neo-plastic prostaglandins. Salicylic acid found significant quantities plant-based diet. However, plants salicylic acid also reported modulate expression numerous enzymes antioxidant activity. aim study assess whether salicylic acid modulate pro-cancerous biological pathways colon. Oxidative stress, prostaglandins cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cyGPX) analysed proximal, transverse distal colon rat model diet-induced oxidative stress. Elevated plasma pyruvate kinase activity (1293+/-206 U/ml) increased indices lipid peroxidation colon (proximal 6.4+/-0.84 nM MDA/mg protein; transverse 6.9+/-0.97 nM MDA/mg protein; distal 5.2+/-0.62 nM MDA/mg protein) rats fed Vitamin E deficient diet significantly decreased supplementation salicylic acid (plasma pyruvate 546+/-43 U/ml; salicylic acid proximal 3.6+/-0.39 nM MDA/mg protein; transverse 4.5+/-0.61 nM MDA/mg protein; distal 4.4+/-0.27 nM MDA/mg protein). Reductions oxidative stress prostaglandin production supplementation salicylic acid associated elevation glutathione peroxidase activity (Vitamin E deficient proximal 0.056+/-0.013 U/mg protein; transverse 0.073+/-0.008 U/mg protein; distal 0.088+/-0.010 U/mg protein; Vitamin E deficient salicylic acid proximal 0.17+/-0.01 U/mg protein; transverse 0.23+/-0.016 U/mg protein; distal 0.16+/-0.020 U/mg protein). Gpx1 Gpx2 gene transcripts elevated association increased activity soluble glutathione peroxidase activity. Glutathione peroxidases key antioxidant enzymes, catalysing decomposition potentially toxic lipid peroxides. Gpx activity regulation Gpx gene transcription shown previously complex activity necessarily mirrored corresponding elevation gene transcription. supplementing diet Vitamin E deficient rats salicylic acid (1 g/kg diet), study assessed effects salicylic acid cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activity colon. ability salicylic acid modulate antioxidant enzymes colon tissue may important mechanism inhibiting colon cancer development.
