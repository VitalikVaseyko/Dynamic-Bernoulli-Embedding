 Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, acylphosphatase soluble enzymes (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase pyruvate kinase) assayed muscle biopsies patients affected Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) normal controls. Specific activities soluble enzymes decreased dystrophic muscle, acylphosphatase exhibiting marked significant decrease comparable creatine kinase, spite moderate increase serum levels. Also, Ca2+-ATPase, particularly calcium-dependent activity, decreased dystrophic muscle. positive correlation, higher soluble enzymes, obtained acylphosphatase specific activity percentage Ca2+-activation Ca2+-ATPase. findings: suggest impairment microsomal calcium uptake could be, least part, responsible sarcoplasmic calcium accumulation observed DMD; disagree hypothesized role acylphosphatase intracellular calcium homeostasis, consistent enzyme's demonstrated hydrolytic activity phosphorylated intermediate Ca2+-ATPase.
