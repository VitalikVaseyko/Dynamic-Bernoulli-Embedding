 1. Cortical slices kidneys adult rats incubated aerobically 38.5 degrees C Warburg manometers ordinary balanced saline medium also ;low-ion' media consisting 20 mM Tris buffer 0-30 g polyethylene glycol (;PEG 6000')/100 ml. added control swelling tissue.2. Oxygen uptake low ion media containing less 2 m-equiv/l. Na(+) K(+) maximal water content slices kept normal 14% PEG 6000 medium, two thirds oxygen consumption balanced saline medium.3. Slices respiring low-ion media retained potassium concentrations 10-20 times concentration medium; ratio tissue external concentration K(+) inversely related water content tissue.4. Ratios K(+)/Na(+) concentration tissue water maximal equal 10-25 water content near normal ratio Na(+)/K(+) medium 1.5 2.0.5. Cryoscopic measurements showed 14% PEG 6000 contributed 140 m-osmole/kg osmolality low-ion media slices maintained normal water content.6. possible interpret volume cells determined balance osmotic effect PEG 6000 medium colloid osmotic pressure intracellular proteins.
