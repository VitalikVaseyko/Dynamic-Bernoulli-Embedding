 Many fetuses suffering intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) hypoglycaemic. However, underlying mechanisms well established. increased placental glucose consumption IUGR could impair glucose transfer across placenta. study used two different approaches investigate glucose metabolism preterm term placentae IUGR fetuses. determined activity protein expression three rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes phosphofructo kinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase (HXK) cytoplasmic fraction homogenates placentae obtained IUGR appropriate gestational age (AGA) pregnancies. Protein expression assessed using Western blot enzyme activities determined spectrophotometer measuring rate NADH oxidation (PFK PK) NADP reduction (HXK) enzyme reactions coupled respective enzyme. determine distribution glycolytic enzymes immunocytochemistry performed. also measured glucose consumption lactate production fresh placental villous tissue using perifusion system. expression PFK, PK HXK well activity PK HXK unaltered IUGR placentae. activity PFK hand 32 per cent lower IUGR placentae (n=24, P<0.05). Immunocytochemistry confirmed distribution enzymes cytoplasm syncytiotrophoblast. Placental glucose consumption IUGR [0.06+/-0.01 micromol/(min*g), n=5] different AGA [0.06+/-0.005 micromol/(min*g), n=12], whereas lactate production decreased 28 per cent IUGR. results support hypothesis increased placental glucose consumption suggest altered glycolytic pathway IUGR placenta.
