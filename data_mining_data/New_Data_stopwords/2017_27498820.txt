 aim study examine anti-obesity effects boiled tuna extract C57BL/6N mice obesity induced high-fat diet (HFD). determined anti-obesity effects boiled tuna extract (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) progression HFD-induced obesity 10 weeks. mice divided 5 groups follows: normal diet (ND) group (n=10); HFD group (n=10); mice fed HFD 100 mg/kg boiled tuna extract group (n=10); fed HFD 200 mg/kg boiled tuna extract group (n=10); fed HFD 400 mg/kg boiled tuna extract group (n=10). Changes body weight, fat content, serum lipid levels lipogenic enzyme levels measured. consumption boiled tuna extract lowered epididymal tissue weight exerted anti-obesity effects, reflected serum glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), insulin leptin levels. addition, demonstrated changes liver adipogenic- lipogenic-related protein expression western blot analysis. Boiled tuna extract downregulated levels CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, beta delta (C/EBPalpha, beta, delta), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) adipocyte marker genes. Boiled tuna extract also attenuated adipogenic lipogenic gene expression, namely levels fatty acid synthase (FAS), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), glucose transporter type 4 (Glut4) phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha beta (AMPKalpha, beta) dose-dependent manner. Moreover, consumption boiled tuna extract restored levels superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), aspartate transaminase (AST) alanine transaminase (ALT) control group. results suggest boiled tuna extract attenuates progression obesity stimulating fatty acid oxidation upregulation AMPK genes, well inhibiting synthesis adipogenic lipogenic enzymes. characteristics boiled tuna extract highlight potential anti-obesity effects.
