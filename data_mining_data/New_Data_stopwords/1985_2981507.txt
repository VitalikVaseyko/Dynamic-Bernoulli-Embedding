 isolated rat liver cells, inhibition L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation mechanism involved hormonal control glycolysis gluconeogenesis. aim study ascertain whether vivo phosphorylation state enzyme maintained liver perfusion used prepare isolated liver cells. L-PK phosphorylation state studied indirectly liver extracts kinetic measurement, found that, perfusion, S0.5 phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) L-PK decreased time-dependent manner 1 +/- 0.08 0.64 +/- 0.1 mM (P less 0.01) 0.58 +/- 0.06 mM liver cells. shift prevented addition glucagon perfusion medium. extent phosphorylation L-PK also estimated incubation liver extract [gamma-32P]ATP, protein kinase, cyclic AMP, measurement 32Pi incorporated L-PK specific immunoprecipitation. liver extracts removed beginning perfusion, 0.4 mol Pi/mol L-PK incorporated stimulation cyclic AMP. contrast, liver extracts removed 30 min perfusion, cyclic AMP stimulated 32P incorporation two threefold, 1.6 mol Pi/mol L-PK incorporated. data suggest L-PK activated dephosphorylation mechanism rat liver perfusion. phenomenon could involved classical inactivation gluconeogenesis observed perfused rat liver model.
