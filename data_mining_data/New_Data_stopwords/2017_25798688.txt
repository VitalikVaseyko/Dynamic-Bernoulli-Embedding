 Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) one important control point enzyme glycolysis pathway. Hence, inhibitors activators currently considered potential anticancer agents. effect 28 polyphenolic compounds enzyme activity investigated vitro. Among compounds, neoeriocitrin, (-)-catechin gallate, fisetin, (+/-)-taxifolin (-)-epicatechin highest inhibition effect IC50 value within 0.65-1.33 microM range. Myricetin quercetin 3-beta-D-glucoside exhibited highest activation effect 0.51 1.34 microM AC50 values, respectively. Twelve compounds showed inhibition effect within 7-38 microM range IC50 value. Sinapinic acid p-coumaric acid showed activation effect 26.2 22.2 microM AC50 values, respectively. results propose polyphenolics may potential PKM2 inhibitors/activators, may used lead compounds synthesis new inhibitors activators enzyme.
