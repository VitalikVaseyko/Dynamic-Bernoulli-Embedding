 green alga Selenastrum minutum (Naeg.) Collins able assimilate NH(4) (+) dark anaerobic conditions (GC Vanlerberghe, AK Horsey, HG Weger, DH Turpin [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 1551-1557). present study, analysis metabolites following addition NH(4) (+) cells acclimated anaerobic conditions shown following. transient decline adenylate energy charge 0.6 0.4 followed recovery back ~0.6. accompanied rapid increase pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate/fructose-6-phosphate ratios indicating activation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructokinase, respectively. also increase fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which, since alga lacks pyrophosphate dependent 6-phosphofructokinase inferred inhibit gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. changes resulted increase rate anaerobic starch breakdown. Anaerobic NH(4) (+) assimilation also resulted two-fold increase rate production major fermentative end-products alga, d-lactate ethanol. change rate accumulation fermentative end product succinate malate accumulated anoxia NH(4) (+) assimilation. rapid increase Gln decline Glu indicates primary NH(4) (+) assimilation anoxia via glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase. Almost N assimilated conditions sequestered alanine. results allow us propose model regulation carbon metabolism anaerobic NH(4) (+) assimilation.
