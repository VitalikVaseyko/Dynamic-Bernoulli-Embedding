 BACKGROUND: Microalgae emerging biofuel resource; however, germplasm improvement slow due lack molecular tools. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) deactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA production via PDC important plant tissues active fatty acid synthesis. RESULTS: 1261-bp cDNA putative PDK gene (PtPDK) cloned diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, PtPDK antisense knockdown transgenic diatoms generated. PtPDK transcript abundance enzyme activity reduced significantly due antisense knockdown PtPDK. Neutral lipid content transgenic diatom cells increased 82% determined Nile red staining, fatty acid composition altered. Transgenic cells showed slightly lower growth rate similar cell size wild type, hence retaining similar biomass productivity. CONCLUSIONS: work first obtained successful engineered diatom regulating key gene involved lipid metabolism. findings also provide powerful indications enhancing microalgal lipid production metabolic engineering biofuel industry.
