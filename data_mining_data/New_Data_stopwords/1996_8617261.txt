 assess role cAMP regulation autophagy, examined effects cAMP analogues cAMP-elevating agents freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, using electroinjected [3H]raffinose autophagy probe. Glucagon found stimulate, inhibit effect autophagy, depending inclusion metabolites like pyruvate (which caused ATP depletion autophagy suppression) amino acids (a complete mixture antagonized pyruvate) incubation medium. Inhibition also observed theophylline, cAMP-elevating inhibitor cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclase activator deacetylforskolin. low concentrations deacetylforskolin, inhibition could abolished amino acids. N6,2'-O-Dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (Bt2-cAMP) strongly inhibited autophagic sequestration [3H]raffinose overall autophagic protein degradation; again, amino acids abolished autophagy-inhibitory effect low Bt2-cAMP concentrations. Several cAMP analogues (8-thiomethyl-cAMP, N6-benzoyl-cAMP, (S)-5,6-dichloro-1-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole 3',5'-[thio]monophosphate, (S)-8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-[thio]monophosphate) inhibited autophagy well. effect Bt2-cAMP rapid, dose-dependent, reversible require concomitant protein synthesis. Neither Bt2-cAMP deacetylforskolin reduced intracellular ATP levels cell viability, ruling inhibition autophagy non-specific cytotoxicity. autophagy-inhibitory effect Bt2-cAMP could substantially antagonized (40-50%) KT-5720, specific inhibitor cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor K-252a. Somewhat surprisingly, KN-62 KT-5926, allegedly specific inhibitors Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II myosin light chain kinase, respectively, also Bt2-cAMP-antagonistic. results suggest cAMP regulates early, sequestrational step hepatocytic autophagy highly conditional, dual mechanism, inhibition predominant conditions freshly isolated hepatocytes, whereas stimulation reportedly predominates vivo. effect cAMP probably mediated protein kinase A, protein kinases would appear participate regulation autophagic sequestration well.
