 activities zonal distribution key enzymes carbohydrate metabolism studied livers rats end-to-side portocaval anastomosis. Sham-operated control animals periods interruption hepatic blood supply shunted animals pair-fed. following alterations observed: Food uptake reduced 20% first postoperational day; increased continuously 70% day 8. Body weight, small 10% postoperational decrease, remained unaltered, liver weight lowered 55% day 8 stayed constant. total glycogen reserves liver (g X 100 g body weight-1) reduced, transient fall 10% day 1-4, 25%. total activity glucogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mumol . min-1 X 100 g body weight-1) diminished, transient increase 190% 150% day 1 2 respectively, 55% day 8 onwards. total activity glucogenic glucose-6-phosphatase lowered without transient rise 30%. total activities glycolytic pyruvate kinase isoenzyme L glucokinase decreased continuously 40% day 8; citrate cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase lowered parallel liver weight 55%. transient decrease glycogen reserves intermediate increase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase capacity due operational stress, since observed also sham-operated control animals. alterations, decrease liver weight capacities gluconeogenic glycolytic key enzymes, specific portocaval anastomosis. normal periportal perivenous gradient phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 3.5:1, measured microdissected tissue samples, remained specific activities reduced 80% two zones. normal periportal perivenous gradient pyruvate kinase L 1:1.7 equalized levels lowered 35% 23%, respectively, two zones. normal periportal perivenous gradients glucose-6-phosphatase succinate dehydrogenase, demonstrated histochemically, essentially maintained perivenous bridging occurring transiently day 4 8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 400 WORDS)
