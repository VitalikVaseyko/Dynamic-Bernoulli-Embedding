 Drug dependence escalating problem worldwide many efforts made understand molecular basis addiction. morphine model widely used investigations. date, least 29 studies exploring influence morphine mammals' proteomes published. Among various proteins indicated up- down-regulated, expression changes enzymes engaged energy metabolism pathways often confirmed. verify whether proteomics-indicated alterations enzyme levels reflect changes activity, four enzymes: PK, MDH, Complex I, Complex V investigated morphine addiction abstinence models. analyses rat brain mitochondria fraction model morphine dependence, found one investigated enzymes (pyruvate kinase) showed statistically significant differences observed morphine, control, abstinence groups.
