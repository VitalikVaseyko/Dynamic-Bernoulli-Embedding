 Biofilm extremely complex microbial community arranged matrix polysaccharides attached substrate. development crucial pathophysiology oral infections like dental caries, well periodontal, pulp, periapical diseases. Streptococcus mutans one effective microorganisms lactic acid production dental biofilm. Identifying essential Streptococcus mutans proteins using bioinformatics methods helps search alternative therapies. end, bacterial genomes several Streptococcus mutans strains representative strains cariogenic non-cariogenic bacteria analysed identifying pathogenicity islands alignments bacteria, detecting exclusive genes cariogenic species comparison non-pathogenic ones. study used tools orthology prediction BLAST OrthoMCL, well server IslandViewer detection pathogenicity islands. addition, potential interactome Streptococcus mutans rebuilt comparing interologues species phylogenetically close associated cariogenicity. protocol yielded final list 20 proteins related potentially virulent factors used therapeutic targets future analyses. EIIA EIIC enzymatic subunits phosphotransferase system (PTS) prioritized, well pyruvate kinase enzyme, directly involved metabolism carbohydrates obtaining necessary energy microorganism's survival. results guide subsequent experimental trial develop new, safe, effective molecules treatment dental caries.
