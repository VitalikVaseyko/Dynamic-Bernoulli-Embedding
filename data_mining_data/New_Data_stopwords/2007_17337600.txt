 question "is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha(2)-isoform friend foe protection myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury?" still debate, studied functional consequence deletion contractility, energetics, respiration isolated perfused heart characterized response low-flow ischemia reperfusion glucose pyruvate substrates. alpha(2)-AMPK deletion affect basal contractility, respiration, high-energy phosphate contents induced twofold reduction glycogen content threefold reduction glucose uptake. Low-flow ischemia increased AMPK phosphorylation stimulated glucose uptake phosphorylation alpha(2)-knockout (alpha(2)-KO) wild-type (WT) groups. high sensitivity alpha(2)-KO development ischemic contracture attributed constitutive impairment glucose transport glycogen content perturbation energy transfer creatine kinase (CK). functional coupling MM-CK myofibrillar ATPase CK fluxes indeed similar alpha(2)-KO WT. Low-flow ischemia impaired CK flux 50% strains, showing alpha(2)-AMPK control CK activity. Despite higher sensitivity contracture, postischemic contractility recovered similar levels alpha(2)-KO WT absence fatty acids. presence, alpha(2)-AMPK deletion also accelerated contracture delayed postischemic contractile recovery. conclusion, alpha(2)-AMPK required normal glucose uptake glycogen content, protects heart development ischemic contracture, contractile recovery absence fatty acids.
