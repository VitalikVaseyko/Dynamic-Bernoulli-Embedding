 BACKGROUND: cancers, including breast cancer, high rates glucose consumption, associated lactate production, process referred "Warburg effect". Acidification tumour microenvironment lactate extrusion, performed lactate transporters (MCTs), associated higher cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis increased cell survival. Previously, described MCT1 up-regulation breast carcinoma samples demonstrated importance vitro MCT inhibition. study, performed siRNA knockdown MCT1 MCT4 basal-like breast cancer cells normoxia hypoxia conditions validate potential lactate transport inhibition breast cancer treatment. RESULTS: effect MCT knockdown evaluated lactate efflux, proliferation, cell biomass, migration invasion induction tumour xenografts nude mice. MCT knockdown led decrease vitro tumour cell aggressiveness, decreased lactate transport, cell proliferation, migration invasion and, importantly, inhibition vivo tumour formation growth. CONCLUSIONS: work supports MCTs promising targets cancer therapy, demonstrates contribution MCTs cancer cell aggressiveness and, importantly, shows, first time, disruption vivo breast tumour growth targeting lactate transport.
