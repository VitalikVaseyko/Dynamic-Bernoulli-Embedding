 describe effects modulating activities glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucomutase branching point sugar degradation biosynthesis sugar nucleotides involved production exopolysaccharide biosynthesis Lactococcus lactis. realized using described isogenic L. lactis mutant reduced enzyme activities controlled expression well-characterized genes phosphoglucomutase glucokinase Escherichia coli Bacillus subtilis, respectively. role decreased metabolic flux studied L. lactis strains decreased phosphofructokinase activities. concomitant reduction activities phosphofructokinase enzymes encoded las operon (lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase) resulted significant changes concentrations sugar-phosphates. contrast, >25-fold overproduction glucokinase resulted 7-fold-increased fructose-6-phosphate levels 2-fold-reduced glucose-1-phosphate glucose-6-phosphate levels. However, increased sugar-phosphate concentrations affect levels sugar nucleotides. Finally, approximately 100-fold overproduction phosphoglucomutase resulted 5-fold-increased levels UDP-glucose UDP-galactose. increased concentrations sugar-phosphates sugar nucleotides significantly affect production exopolysaccharides, demonstrate metabolic flexibility L. lactis.
