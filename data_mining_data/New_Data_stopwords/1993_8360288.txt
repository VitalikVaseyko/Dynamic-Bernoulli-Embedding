 primary objective present study evaluate recovery plasma mitochondrial membrane functions 30 min hypoglycemic coma establish whether lingering accumulation free fatty acids (FFAs) delays recovery. secondary objective study whether production metabolic acids following glucose infusion leads fall intracellular pH (pHi). Phosphocreatine, creatine, ATP, ADP, AMP, well glycogen, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, FFAs rat brain cortex caudoputamen measured, "free" ADP calculated creatine kinase equilibrium. Extracellular pH (pHe) K+ concentration (K+e) measured ion-sensitive microelectrodes, pHi derived CO2 method. Glucose injection followed resumption oxidative phosphorylation within approximately 2 min equally rapid restoration normal K+e levels. functions recovered although tissue FFAs remained elevated least 7-8 min. Tissue lactate content increased moderately production metabolic acids lead intracellular acidosis. 15 min recovery, pHi moderately increased, although pHe fell toward 7.0. speculated dissociation intra- extra-cellular pH compatible up-regulation Na+/H+ antiporter, e.g., phosphorylation.
