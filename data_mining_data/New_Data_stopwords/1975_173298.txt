 1. Cultures Escherichia coli growing gluconate use gluconate glucose glucose added. 2. Glycerol-grown cells adapt gluconate utilization even media containing glucose well gluconate. 3. rates gluconate utilization cells growing mixture glucose gluconate, specific activities gluconate uptake system gluconate kinase, greater adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) present medium absence. 4. Growth media containing gluconate cyclic AMP accompanied formation methyl glyoxal pyruvate, progressive inhibition growth. 5. mutant devoid adenylate cyclase activity (cya) grew well glucose absence exogenous cyclic AMP grew poorly gluconate; neither gluconate uptake system gluconate kinase adequately induced. addition cyclic AMP promoted growth gluconate facilitated induction proteins required gluconate catabolism. 6. Phage Pl-mediated transduction cya+ cya-mutant also restored wild-type phenotype ability adapt gluconate utilization.
