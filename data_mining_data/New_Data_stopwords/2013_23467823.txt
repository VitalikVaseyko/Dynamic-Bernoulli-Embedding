 introduction multilocus sequence typing (MLST) strain characterization provided first sequence-based approach genotyping many fungi, leading reproducible, reliable, exchangeable data. MLST scheme based analysis six housekeeping genes developed genotyping Geotrichum candidum. scheme first developed using 18 isolates complete sequences alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ALA1), pyruvate kinase (CDC19), acetyl-coA acetyltransferase (ERG10), glutaminyl-tRNA synthase (GLN4), phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI1), phosphoglucomutase (PGM2) housekeeping genes determined. Multiple sequence alignments genes used define set loci showing, closely possible, phylogenetic resolution level complete gene sequences. scheme subsequently validated 22 additional isolates dairy non-dairy sources. Overall, 58 polymorphic sites indexed among 3,009 nucleotides analyzed. Depending loci, four eight alleles detected, generating 17 different sequence types, ten represented single strain. MLST analysis suggested predominantly clonal population 40 G. candidum isolates. Phylogenetic analysis concatenated sequences revealed distantly related group four isolates. Interestingly, group diverged respect internal transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1), 5.8S, ITS2 analysis. reproducibility MLST approach compared random amplification microsatellites PCR (RAM-PCR), gel profiling method previously proposed G. candidum strain typing. results found MLST differentiation efficient RAM-PCR, MLST also offered non-ambiguous, unique language, permitting data exchange evolutionary inference.
