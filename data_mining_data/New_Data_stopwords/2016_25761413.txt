 OBJECTIVE: Development brown-like/beige adipocytes white adipose tissue (WAT) helps reduce obesity. Thus investigated effects resveratrol, dietary polyphenol capable preventing obesity related complications humans animal models, brown-like adipocyte formation inguinal WAT (iWAT). METHODS: CD1 female mice (5-month old) fed high-fat diet with/without 0.1% resveratrol. addition, primary stromal vascular cells separated iWAT subjected resveratrol treatment. Markers brown-like (beige) adipogenesis measured involvement AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha1 assessed using conditional knockout. RESULTS: Resveratrol significantly increased mRNA and/or protein expression brown adipocyte markers, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain-containing 16, cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector A, elongation long-chain fatty acids protein 3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha, cytochrome c pyruvate dehydrogenase, differentiated iWAT stromal vascular cells (SVCs), suggesting resveratrol induced brown-like adipocyte formation vitro. Concomitantly, resveratrol markedly enhanced AMPKalpha1 phosphorylation differentiated SVC oxygen consumption. changes absent cells lacking AMPKalpha1, showing AMPKalpha1 critical mediator resveratrol action. Resveratrol also induced beige adipogenesis vivo along appearance multiocular adipocytes, increased UCP1 expression enhanced fatty acid oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol induces brown-like adipocyte formation iWAT via AMPKalpha1 activation suggest beneficial antiobesity effects may partly due browning WAT and, consequence, increased oxygen consumption.
