 Given role mitochondria oxygen consumption, metabolism cell death regulation, alterations mitochondrial function dysregulation cell death pathways contribute genesis progression cancer. Cancer cells exhibit array metabolic transformations induced mutations leading gain-of-function oncogenes loss-of-function tumor suppressor genes include increased glucose consumption, reduced mitochondrial respiration, increased reactive oxygen species generation cell death resistance, ensure cancer progression. Cholesterol metabolism disturbed cancer cells supports uncontrolled cell growth. particular, accumulation cholesterol mitochondria emerges molecular component orchestrates metabolic alterations cancer cells impairing mitochondrial function. consequence, mitochondrial cholesterol loading cancer cells may contribute, part, Warburg effect stimulating aerobic glycolysis meet energetic demand proliferating cells, protecting cancer cells mitochondrial apoptosis due changes mitochondrial membrane dynamics. understanding complexity metabolic alterations cancer cells, mediated largely alterations mitochondrial function, may pave way identify efficient strategies cancer treatment involving use small molecules targeting mitochondria, cholesterol homeostasis/trafficking specific metabolic pathways.
