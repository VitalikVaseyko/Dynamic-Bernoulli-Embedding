 integrated energetic metabolic signaling roles place phosphoryl transfer network, enzymes creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), pyruvate kinase (PK), regulatory system coordinating components cellular bioenergetics network. Analysis enzymes provides new information perspectives understand disturbances energetic metabolism sites adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation utilization. Thus, aim study evaluate involvement phosphoryl transfer network splenic tissue linked pathogenesis silver catfish naturally infected Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Splenic cytosolic mitochondrial CK activities decreased infected animals compared uninfected animals, also observed splenic PK activity splenic ATP levels. contrast, splenic AK activity increased infected animals compared uninfected animals. Based evidence, inhibition absence efficient communication CK isoenzymes cause impairment splenic bioenergetics, turn compensated augmentation splenic AK activity attempt restore energy homeostasis. inhibition splenic PK activity impairs communication sites ATP generation ATP utilization, corroborated splenic ATP depletion. summary, alterations contribute disease pathogenesis linked spleen tissue animals infected white spot disease.
