 complete nucleotide sequence Aspergillus nidulans pyruvate kinase gene, including flanking sequences, presented. gene 1,578 bp coding sequence encodes protein 526 amino acids; latter strongly homologous pyruvate kinases found Saccharomyces cerevisiae (66%) mammals (53%). gene interrupted seven introns, three conserved position compared present mammalian pyruvate kinase genes sequenced thus far. fourth intron within mononucleotide binding fold domain conserved position respect position intron within NAD+ binding region maize ADH I. transcription start site determined; major site transcription found 80 bp translation initiation codon. promoter region A. nidulans pyruvate kinase gene contains direct homologies TATA CCAAT sequences expected region (30-70 bp) transcription initiation site. However, extended CT-enriched regions found promotor region, similar observed genes highly expressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentous fungi.
