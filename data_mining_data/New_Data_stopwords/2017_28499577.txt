 Cancer cells rewire metabolism promote growth, survival, proliferation long-term maintenance. common feature altered metabolism increased glucose uptake fermentation glucose lactate, observed even presence completely functioning mitochondria. effect known 'Warburg Effect' intensive investigation last decade partially established either causes functions. emerging major side effect Warburg Effect immunosuppression, limits immunogenicity cancer cells therefore restricts therapeutic efficacy anticancer immunotherapy. discuss metabolic communication cancer infiltrating myeloid cells contributes cancer immune evasion understanding mechanisms may improve current immunotherapies.
