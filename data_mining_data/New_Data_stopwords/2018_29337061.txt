 Keloids, tumor-like fibroproliferative cutaneous lesions, reported metabolic disturbance. However, metabolic character remains unclear. purpose study determine glycolytic reprogramming important pathogenesis keloids assess inhibition potential glycolysis keloid treatment. intracellular metabolic profile assay used compare metabolic phenotypes normal skin fibroblasts keloid fibroblasts (NFs KFs). data indicated KFs underwent reprogramming metabolic phonotype oxidative phosphorylation aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) augmented glycolysis glycolytic capacity. gene protein assays showed expression glycolytic enzymes upregulated KFs compared NFs. data showed higher glucose influx lactate production KFs compared NFs. Furthermore, proliferation KFs suppressed dose-dependent time-dependent manner inhibition glycolysis 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG). Taken together, findings suggested keloids underwent reprogrammed metabolic phenotype aerobic glycolysis. essential keloid hyperplasia, glycolytic inhibitors might provide potential treatment keloids.
