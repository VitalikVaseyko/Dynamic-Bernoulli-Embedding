 effects moderate dietary restriction (DR) certain blood parameters metabolic enzymes studied 80 male Lobund-Wistar rats 6, 12, 18, 24 30 months age. Two groups rats fed ad libitum (AL) restricted (DR) 12 g per day weaning. Adult DR rats received 30% less diet per day compared adult rats AL group. Blood glycohemoglobin levels increased significantly age AL rats, DR group. Hematocrit showed significant decrease 24 30 months groups. Serum glucose levels rats affected either diet age. Five enzymes liver cytosolic fractions determined. Activities pyruvate kinase (PK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly lower DR group AL group age. Activities glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) significantly higher DR group AL group. results suggest moderate DR decreased glycolytic pathway appears stimulate amino acid metabolism increase gluconeogenesis.
