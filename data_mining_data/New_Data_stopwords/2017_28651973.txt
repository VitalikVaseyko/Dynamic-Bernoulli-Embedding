 Prostate cell metabolism exhibits distinct profiles pre- post-malignancy. malignant metabolic shift converts prostate cells "citrate-producing" "citrate-oxidizing" cells, thereby enhancing glucose metabolism, phenotype contrasts classical tumoral Warburg metabolism. on-line biosensor chip system (BIONAS 2500) used monitor metabolic changes (glycolysis respiration) response putative anti-cancer nutraceutical 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], different prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU145 PC3). LNCaP cells exhibited profound metabolic responsiveness treatment thus extensive analysis metabolism-modulating effects 1,25(OH)2D3 performed, including mRNA expression analysis key metabolic genes (e.g. GLUT1 PDHK1), analysis TCA cycle metabolites, glucose uptake/consumption measurements, ATP production, mitochondrial biogenesis/activity. Altogether, data demonstrate vivid disruption glucose metabolism 1,25(OH)2D3, illustrated decreased glucose uptake accumulation citrate/isocitrate due TCA cycle truncation. Depletion glycolytic intermediates led consistent decrease TXNIP expression response 1,25(OH)2D3, effect coincided activation AMPK signaling reduction c-MYC expression. Reduction TXNIP levels response 1,25(OH)2D3 rescued AMPK signaling inhibitor mimicked MYC inhibitor highlighting possible involvement pathways mediating 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolic effects PCa cells. Furthermore, pharmacological genetic modulation androgen receptor showed similar disparate effects metabolic parameters compared 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, highlighting AR-independent nature 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolism-modulating effects.
