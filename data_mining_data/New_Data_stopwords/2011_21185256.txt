 Metabolic adaptations associated changes enzyme activities. adaptations characterized patterns positive negative changes metabolic fluxes concentrations intermediate metabolites. Knowledge mechanism parameters governing enzyme kinetics rarely available. However, signs-increases decreases-of many changes predicted using signs metabolic control coefficients. signs require knowledge structure metabolic network limited qualitative knowledge regulatory dependences, widely available carbon metabolism. Here, case study, identified control coefficients fixed signs order predict pattern changes key enzyme activities explain observed changes fluxes concentrations underlying metabolic adaptations oncogenic K-ras transformation NIH-3T3 cells. fixed signs control coefficients indicate metabolic changes following oncogenic transformation-increased glycolysis oxidative branch pentose-phosphate pathway, decreased concentration sugar-phosphates-could associated increases activity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, decrease transketolase. predictions validated experimentally measuring specific activities. conclude predictions based fixed signs control coefficients robust tool identification changes enzyme activities explain observed metabolic adaptations carbon metabolism.
