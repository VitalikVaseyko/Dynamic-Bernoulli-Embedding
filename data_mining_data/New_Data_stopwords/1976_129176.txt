 erythrocytes newborn adult goats studied respect GSH stability, GSH regeneration, levels ATP 2, 3-DPG, glucose consumption activities nine different enzymes Embden-Meyerhof pentose phosphate pathways glucose metabolism. Red cells newborn goats significantly higher levels ATP 2, 3-DPG. activities enzymes measured also significantly greater newborn. suggested newborn goats possess red blood cells metabolically active adult goats.
