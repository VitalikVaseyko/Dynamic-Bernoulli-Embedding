 OBJECTIVE: screen identify potential candidates development toxoplasmosis vaccine. METHODS: Rats infected Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) RH strain sera used probe screen T. gondii tachyzoite cDNA expression libraries. positive clones analyzed PCR amplification DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Thirteen positive clones obtained 4 x 10(5) phage plagues three rounds screening. size inserts ranged 0.45 kb 2.4 kb. BLAST search available sequence databases using partial sequences four positive clones (L1, L2, L4, L5) showed sequence L2 clone identical T. gondii P24 major antigen gene (TgP24). Clone L4 high homology Saccharum officinarum pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. significant hit sequences clone L1, suggesting L1 could novel gene(GenBank accession number AY180109), named T.g-R1, encodes non-transmembrane protein 134 amino acid open reading frame. PROSCAN analysis T.g-R1 amino acid sequence showed gene product contains two protein kinase C phosphorylation site, two casein kinase II phosphorylation site, one N-myristoylation site one microbodies C-terminal targeting signal. Clone L5 small partial fragment. CONCLUSION: identification positive clones provides possible way development toxoplasmosis vaccine.
