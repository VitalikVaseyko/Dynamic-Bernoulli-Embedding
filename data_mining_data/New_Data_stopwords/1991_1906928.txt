 Thermosensitive mutants Bacillus subtilis deficient peptidoglycan synthesis screened mutations meso-diaminopimelate (LD-A2pm) metabolic pathway. Mutations two five relevant linkage groups, lssB lssD, shown induce, restrictive temperature, deficiency LD-A2pm synthesis accumulation UDP-MurNAc-dipeptide. Group lssB heterogeneous; encompasses mutations confer deficiency deacylation N-acetyl-LL-A2pm accumulation precursor. Accordingly, mutations assigned previously identified locus dapE. Mutations linkage group lssD entail thermosensitive aspartokinase 1. Therefore, likely affect structural gene enzyme, propose designate dapG. Mutation pyc-1476, previously reported affect pyruvate carboxylase, shown confer deficiency aspartokinase 1, carboxylase, belong dapG locus, dapG closely linked spoVF, putative gene dipicolinate synthase. conclusion, mutations affecting two eight steps known involved LD-A2pm synthesis uncovered large collection thermosensitive mutants obtained indirect selection. propose surprisingly restricted distribution thermosensitive dap mutations isolated far due existence, step pathway, isoenzymes encoded separate genes. biological role different aspartokinases investigated mutants deficient dapE dapG genes. Growth characteristics mutants presence various combinations aspartate family amino acids allow reassessment metabolic channel hypothesis, i.e. proposed existence multienzyme complexes, specific given end product.
