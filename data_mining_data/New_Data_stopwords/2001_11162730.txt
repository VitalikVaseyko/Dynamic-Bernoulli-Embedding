 investigate functional role nonhelical domains intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin, carried transient transfection constructs encoding fusion proteins domains enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Expression fusion proteins effect endogenous networks transfected cells. However, head domain-EGFP fusion protein localized almost exclusively nucleus. localization could disrupted reversible fashion chilling cells. Furthermore, head domain capable targeting nucleus strictly cytoplasmic protein, pyruvate kinase. Thus, vimentin head domain contains information specifically directs proteins nucleus. contrast, nonhelical tail domain vimentin, expressed fusion protein EGFP, retained cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic retention tail domain-containing fusion proteins appeared dependent integrity microtubule network. results consistent proposal nonhelical end domains vimentin involved maintaining extended network exerting oppositely directed forces along filaments. head domains exert nuclear-directed force tail domains extend network toward cell periphery via microtubule-dependent mechanism.
