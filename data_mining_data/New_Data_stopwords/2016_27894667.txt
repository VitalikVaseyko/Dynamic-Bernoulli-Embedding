 Surgical resection, providing long-term survival hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, regarded one standard curative treatments HCC tumor resectable. However, 50% patients develop early recurrence (ER) first two years operation, diffuse rarely treatable unsatisfactory long-term survival. Unfortunately, underlying mechanisms ER curative resection molecular markers predictive prognostic significance never identified yet. Recent studies reveal pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) levels correlated overall survival disease-free survival patients HCC. present study aimed investigate correlation expression PKM2 ER. findings demonstrated total PKM2 expression nuclear PKM2 expression independent risk factor ER curative resection, could promising intervention target following curative resection HCC patients.
