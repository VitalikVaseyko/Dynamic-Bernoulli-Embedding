 nucleotide sequence pelB, member Aspergillus niger pectin lyase multigene family, determined. pelB gene product, PLB, shares 65% amino acid identity pectin lyase (PLA) 60% pectin lyase (PLD). Although growth pelB multicopy transformants pectin-containing media results elevated pelB mRNA levels, pectin lyase B (PLB) barely detectable. probably due degradation PLB acid proteases, since multicopy transformants grown pectin medium high concentration phosphate, leading less rapid decline pH, secrete detectable amounts PLB. produce PLB high amounts conditions extracellular enzymes present, tried two strategies. Firstly, heterologous expression pelB gene A. nidulans, secondly, expression pelB gene control constitutive A. niger pki promoter.
