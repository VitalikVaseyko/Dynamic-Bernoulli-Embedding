 high fat diet (HFD) induces substantial cardiac metabolic alteration(s), initiating molecular events remain unclear. assessed early cardiac energy metabolic changes C57/BJ mice fed HFD 10days. Carbohydrate oxidation markedly decreased mice HFD, up-regulation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) evident. Concurrently, E2F1, transcription factor controlling PDK4 expression, activated, cyclin D1, upstream-molecule E2F1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), modulator cyclinD1 translation. Hence, HFD may initiate early cardiac metabolic alterations eIF4E/cyclin D1/E2F1/PDK4 axis.
