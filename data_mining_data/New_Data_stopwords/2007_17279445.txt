 production alpha-ketoglutarate, adenine, thuringiensin production rate thuringiensin yield glucose consumed increased 22%, 36%, 40% 40%, respectively, presence 2 g citrate/l. However, citrate decreased pyruvate production, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production rate PHB yield 62%, 31% 45%, respectively. activities pyruvate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 36%-45% lower 50%-120% higher control, respectively. results suggest citrate regulated carbon flux synthesis adenine present thuringiensin higher efficiency utilization glucose decreasing PHB synthesis.
