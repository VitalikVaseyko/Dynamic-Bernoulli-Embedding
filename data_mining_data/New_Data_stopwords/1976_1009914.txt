 results reported paper refer modifications energetic equilibrium myocardium tissue, involved altitude chronic hypoxia. Experiments done adult rats (males females) placed Jungfraujoch station, Alps, 3,500 m. obtained data compared control animals, bred Geneva. first days stay high altitude, significant fall tissue energy charge, due non-modified enzyme levels comparison controls, observed. several weeks stay chronic hypoxia, metabolic modifications leading improvement energy production achievement new equilibrium state, take place. acclimatized animals good correlation, energy charge activity glycolytic enzymes (PGK PK) ensuring ATP generation, established.
