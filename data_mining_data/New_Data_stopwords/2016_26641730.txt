 Mass spectrometry emerged useful tool study proteins protein complexes. fundamental interest explore structures proteins protein complexes affected absence solvent alters increasing time gas phase. demonstrate range protein protein complexes confined within Trap T-wave region modified Waters Synapt G2S instrument, including monomeric (beta-lactoglobulin), dimeric (beta-lactoglobulin enolase), tetrameric (streptavidin, concanavalin A, pyruvate kinase), pentameric (C-reactive protein) complexes, ranging size 237 kDa. demonstrate complexes confined within Trap region varying lengths time range 1-60 86% trapping efficiency 1 trapping. Furthermore, using model systems, show noncovalent complexes also fragmented surface-induced dissociation (SID) following trapping. SID reveals similar dissociation patterns trapping times studied unactivated protein complexes, suggesting conformational changes occurring time scale insufficient cause substantial differences SID spectra complexes. Intentional alteration structure cone activation produces distinct SID spectrum, differences observed conserved, comparison unactivated complex, trapping. However, subtle differences SID spectra activated complex also observed function trapping time.
