 Regulation mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeability dual importance: normal metabolite energy exchange mitochondria cytoplasm, thus control respiration, apoptosis release apoptogenic factors cytosol. However, mechanism regulation involving voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), major channel MOM, remains controversial. example, one long-standing puzzles permeabilized cells, adenine nucleotide translocase less accessible cytosolic ADP isolated mitochondria. Still another puzzle that, according channel-reconstitution experiments, voltage regulation VDAC limited potentials exceeding 30mV, believed much high MOM. solved puzzles uncovered multiple new functional links identifying missing player regulation VDAC and, hence, MOM permeability - cytoskeletal protein tubulin. shown that, depending VDAC phosphorylation state applied voltage, nanomolar micromolar concentrations dimeric tubulin induce functionally important reversible blockage VDAC reconstituted planar phospholipid membranes. voltage sensitivity blockage equilibrium truly remarkable. described effective "gating charge" ten elementary charges, thus making blockage reaction responsive applied voltage voltage-sensitive channels electrophysiology are. Analysis tubulin-blocked state demonstrated although state still able conduct small ions, impermeable ATP multi-charged anions reduced aperture inversed selectivity. findings, obtained channel reconstitution assay, supported experiments isolated mitochondria human hepatoma cells. Taken together, results suggest previously unknown mechanism regulation mitochondrial energetics, governed VDAC interaction tubulin mitochondria-cytosol interface. Immediate physiological implications include new insights serine/threonine kinase signaling pathways, Ca(2+) homeostasis, cytoskeleton/microtubule activity health disease, especially case highly dynamic microtubule network characteristic cancerogenesis cell proliferation. present review, speculate findings may help identify new mechanisms mitochondria-associated action chemotherapeutic microtubule-targeting drugs, also understand cancer cells preferentially use inefficient glycolysis rather oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect). article part Special Issue entitled: VDAC structure, function, regulation mitochondrial metabolism.
