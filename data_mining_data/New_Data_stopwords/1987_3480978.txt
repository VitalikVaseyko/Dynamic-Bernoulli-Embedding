 Cellular energy-related bioactivities [energy charge = ATP + 0.5 ADP/(ATP + ADP + AMP)], enzyme activities adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, free amino acids plasma cells, protein synthesis (3H-leucine incorporation) measured granulocytes isolated peripheral blood 13 CAPD-treated adult patients. values compared 37 normal adult controls, 29 complete data biochemical parameters. Eleven CAPD patients studied second time, 3 8 months first study. Initially, 20 +/- 8 months CAPD compared (P less 0.05, only) controls, patients normal increased activities enzymes pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, contrast previous results hemodialyzed patients; adenylate kinase, ATP, protein synthesis reduced. Concentrations many amino acids plasma abnormal, including reduced valine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, noted others. Histidine, glutamic acid, citrulline especially increased. intracellular concentrations essential amino acids within normal limits, citrulline, glycine, taurine levels markedly increased glutamic acid SAGN (serine + asparagine + glutamine) decreased. second study, intracellular energy-related bioactivities abnormal concentrations amino acids plasma essentially unchanged. However, virtually intracellular amino acid concentrations higher. results also striking contrast previously reported hemodialysis patients intracellular concentrations branched-chain amino acids methionine well protein synthesis strikingly decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
