 Total protein content P-815 mastocytoma cells decreases increases response initiation new growth cycle. level increases, rate synthesis declines. events occur prior decrease rate cellular proliferation. temporal relationships indicate rate protein synthesis reflects intracellular concentration protein rather cellular growth rate, hypothesized. Pyruvate kinase protein metabolism differs total protein three ways: (a) accumulation stop, (b) rate synthesis decrease, (c) rate pyruvate kinase degradation altered factor present conditioned media. observations suggest specific mechanisms regulating pyruvate kinase post-transcriptional level.
