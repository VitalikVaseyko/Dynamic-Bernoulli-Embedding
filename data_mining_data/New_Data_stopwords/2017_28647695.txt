 Compared normal cells, cancer cells unique metabolism performing lactic acid fermentation presence oxygen, also known Warburg effect. Researchers proposed several hypotheses elucidate phenomenon, mechanism still enigma. review, discuss three typical models, "damaged mitochondria", "adaptation hypoxia", "cell proliferation requirement", well contributions mass spectrometry analysis toward understanding Warburg effect. Mass spectrometry analysis supports "adaptation hypoxia" model cancer cells using quasi-anaerobic fermentation reduce oxygen consumption vivo. propose hypoxia early event plays crucial role carcinoma initiation development.
