 high mobility group box-B1 (HMGB1)-receptor advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) protein kinase B (Akt) pathways play crucial role tumorigenesis development many malignant tumors. Ethyl pyruvate (EP), potent inhibitor HMGB1 release, exert antitumor effects growth gastric cancer. Therefore, necessary observe effects EP gastric cancer growth vitro vivo. Human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues different grades (N=45) collected. expression HMGB1 RAGE evaluated immunohistochemically biopsy samples. SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells treated EP, expression HMGB1, RAGE, Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) transcription factors identified effects EP cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle distribution apoptosis assessed. subcutaneous xenograft tumor model established, validating effects EP tumor growth vivo. expression HMGB1 RAGE respectively observed 73.3 68.9% gastric adenocarcinoma tissues. frequency positive expression increased ascending grade tumor malignancy. EP decreased expression HMGB1, RAGE, Akt, p-Akt, Ki-67 matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP9), increased expression p53. Moreover, EP could inhibit tumor cell proliferation invasion, induce cell cycle arrest apoptosis slow growth xenograft tumors. conclusion, HMGB1 RAGE strongly expressed gastric adenocarcinoma, EP administration inhibited gastric cancer growth via regulation HMGB1-RAGE Akt pathways. EP may play critical role treatment cancer conjunction therapeutic agents.
