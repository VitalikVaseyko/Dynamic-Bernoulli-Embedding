 Poly(A+) RNA (RNA containing polyadenylic acid sequence) isolated individual livers rats fed standard lab chow, fasted, fasted refed high carbohydrate diet. level functional mRNA coding pyruvate kinase assayed using rabbit reticulocyte vitro translation system. total 35S incorporation newly synthesized liver pyruvate kinase measured compared 35S incorporation albumin, total trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins, released polypeptide chains. relative level mRNA coding liver pyruvate kinase decreases almost 60% upon fasting increases approximately 15-fold upon refeeding high carbohydrate diet 24 h. observed changes amount mRNA coding liver pyruvate kinase agree previously reported changes relative rates liver pyruvate kinase synthesis measured vivo dietary stresses. Thus, suggested alterations amount pyruvate kinase liver response dietary stresses primarily result alteration amount functional mRNA coding enzyme.
