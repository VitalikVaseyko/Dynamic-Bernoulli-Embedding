 activities several enzymes energy metabolism measured heart, red muscle, white muscle deep shallow living squaloid shark, Centroscyllium fabricii Squalus acanthias, respectively. phylogenetic closeness species, combined active predatory nature, similar body form, size makes well matched comparison. first time comparison made involving deep-sea elasmobranch. Enzyme activities similar heart, generally lower red muscle C. fabricii. Paralleling trend seen deep-sea teleosts, white muscle C. fabricii substantially lower activities key glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase, relative S. acanthias shallow living elasmobranchs. Unexpectedly, squaloid sharks examined, creatine phosphokinase activity higher tissues deep living C. fabricii. Low white muscle glycolytic enzyme activities deep-sea species coupled high creatine phosphokinase activity suggests capacity short burst swimming likely limited creatine phosphate supplies exhausted.
