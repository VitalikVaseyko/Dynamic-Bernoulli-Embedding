 Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) acetylating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) PDH phosphatase. ACAT1 "hijacked" contribute Warburg effect human cancer remains unclear. found active, tetrameric ACAT1 commonly upregulated cells stimulated EGF diverse human cancer cells, ACAT1 tetramers, monomers, phosphorylated stabilized enhanced Y407 phosphorylation. Moreover, identified arecoline hydrobromide (AH) covalent ACAT1 inhibitor binds disrupts ACAT1 tetramers. resultant AH-bound ACAT1 monomers cannot reform tetramers. Inhibition tetrameric ACAT1 abolishing Y407 phosphorylation AH treatment results decreased ACAT1 activity, leading increased PDC flux oxidative phosphorylation attenuated cancer cell proliferation tumor growth. findings provide mechanistic understanding oncogenic events signal distinct acetyltransferases regulate cancer metabolism suggest ACAT1 anti-cancer target.
