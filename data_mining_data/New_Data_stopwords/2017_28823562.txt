 Actin main constitution cytoskeleton host cells plays important role mediating bacterial colonization. identify actin-binding proteins Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, actin immobilized 24-well plate used probe adhesion proteins. Five adhesion proteins identified characterized electrophoresis LC-MS/MS: pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), chaperonin GroEL, EF-Tu, could display cell surface, indicating possible role mediating bacterial adhesion host. accordance previous studies, reported five proteins participated promoted adhesion pathogen lactic acid bacteria host. Moreover, PGK-actin binding domain analysis reveals lysine (K) amino acid position 127 PGK might play key role mediating bacterial attachment actin.
