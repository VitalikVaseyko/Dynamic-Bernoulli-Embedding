 anoxia, overall protein synthesis almost undetectable brain western painted turtle. aim investigation address question whether alterations specific proteins comparing normoxic anoxic brain proteomes. Reductions creatine kinase, hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase reflected reduced production adenosine triphosphate (ATP) anoxia reduction transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase reflected conservation ATP possibly decrease intracellular Ca(2+). terms neural protection programed cell death 6 interacting protein (PDCD6IP; protein associated apoptosis), dihydropyrimidinase-like protein, t-complex protein, guanine nucleotide protein G(o) subunit alpha (Go alpha; proteins associated neural degradation impaired cognitive function) also declined. decline actin, gelsolin, PDCD6IP, together increase tubulin, also provided evidence induction neurological repair response. Although proteomic alterations show similarities crucian carp (another anoxia-tolerant species), species-specific responses, supports theory single strategy anoxia tolerance. findings also suggest anoxic turtle brain could etiological model investigating mammalian hypoxic damage clinical neurological disorders.
