 posttranslational modification nuclear cytosolic proteins O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) shown play important role cellular response stress. Although increases O-GlcNAc levels typically thought substrate-driven, studies several transformed cell lines reported glucose deprivation increased O-GlcNAc levels number different mechanisms. major goal study therefore determine whether primary cells, neonatal cardiomyocytes, glucose deprivation increases O-GlcNAc levels mechanism. Glucose deprivation significantly increased cardiomyocyte O-GlcNAc levels time-dependent manner associated decreased O-GlcNAcase (OGA) O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) protein. response unaffected either addition pyruvate alternative energy source p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. However, response glucose deprivation blocked completely glucosamine, inhibition OGA 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate. Interestingly, CaMKII inhibitor KN93 also significantly reduced response glucose deprivation. Lowering extracellular Ca(2+) EGTA blocking store operated Ca(2+) entry SKF96365 also attenuated glucose deprivation-induced increase O-GlcNAc. C2C12 HEK293 cells glucose deprivation heat shock increased O-GlcNAc levels, CaMKII inhibitor KN93 attenuated response stresses. results suggest increased intracellular calcium subsequent activation CaMKII play key role regulating stress-induced increase cellular O-GlcNAc levels.
