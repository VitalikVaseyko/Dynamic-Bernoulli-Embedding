 main focus research apply Metabolic Control Analysis quantitative investigation regulation respiration components Mitochondrial Interactosome (MI, supercomplex consisting ATP Synthasome, mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK), voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), tubulin) permeabilized cardiomyocytes. Flux control coefficients (FCC) measured using two protocols: 1) direct ADP activation, 2) MtCK activation creatine (Cr) presence ATP pyruvate kinase-phosphoenolpyruvate system. results show metabolic control much stronger latter case: sum measured FCC 2.7 versus 0.74 (ADP activation). consistent previous data showing recycling ADP ATP inside MI due functional coupling MtCK ANT limited permeability VDAC compounds, PCr major energy carrier mitochondria ATPases. physiological conditions, MI activated, key sites regulation respiration mitochondria MtCK (FCC = 0.93), adenine nucleotide translocase ANT (FCC = 0.95) CoQ cytochrome c oxidoreductase (FCC = 0.4). results show clearly physiological conditions energy transfer mitochondria cytoplasm regulated MI supercomplex sensitive metabolic signals.
