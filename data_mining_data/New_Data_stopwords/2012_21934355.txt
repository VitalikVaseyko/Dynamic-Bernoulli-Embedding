 Pyruvate major product glycolysis pancreatic beta-cells, ultimate metabolic fate depends relative activities two enzymes. first, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) replenishes oxaloacetate withdrawn tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via carboxylation pyruvate form oxaloacetate. Flux via PC also involved formation NADPH, one several important coupling factors insulin secretion. tissues, PC activity enhanced increased acetyl-CoA. alternative fate pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation form acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). ultimate fate acetyl-CoA carbon oxidation CO2 via TCA cycle, PDC reaction results irreversible loss glucose-derived carbon. Thus, PDC activity stringently regulated. mechanisms controlling PDC activity include end-product inhibition increased acetyl-CoA, NADH ATP, phosphorylation (inactivation) family pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDHKs 1-4). review new developments regulation activities expression PC, PDC PDHKs pancreatic islet relation islet pyruvate disposition glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).
