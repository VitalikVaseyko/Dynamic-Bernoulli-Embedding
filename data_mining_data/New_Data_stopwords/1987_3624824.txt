 Muscle cells cultured six patients Duchenne muscular dystrophy nine normal subjects. Protein myosin content pyruvate kinase (PK) activity similar normal Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures. Creatine kinase (CK) activity lower Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures isoenzyme distribution indicated MB-CK significantly lower, BB-CK significantly higher later Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures. abnormal isoenzyme pattern suggested aberrant impaired maturation Duchenne muscular dystrophy myotubes vitro.
