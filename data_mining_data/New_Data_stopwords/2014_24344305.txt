 JMJD5, Jumonji C domain-containing dioxygenase, important embryonic development cancer growth. Here, show JMJD5 up-regulated hypoxia crucial hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. JMJD5 interacts directly pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM)2 modulate metabolic flux cancer cells. JMJD5-PKM2 interaction resides intersubunit interface region PKM2, hinders PKM2 tetramerization blocks pyruvate kinase activity. interaction also influences translocation PKM2 nucleus promotes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha-mediated transactivation. JMJD5 knockdown inhibits transcription PKM2-HIF-1alpha target genes involved glucose metabolism, resulting reduction glucose uptake lactate secretion cancer cells. JMJD5, along PKM2 HIF-1alpha, recruited hypoxia response element site lactate dehydrogenase PKM2 loci mediates recruitment latter two proteins. data uncover mechanism whereby PKM2 regulated factor-binding-induced homo/heterooligomeric restructuring, paving way cell metabolic reprogram.
