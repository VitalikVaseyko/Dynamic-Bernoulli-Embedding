 Cerebral pyruvate recycling metabolic pathway deriving carbon skeletons reducing equivalents mitochondrial oxaloacetate malate, synthesis mitochondrial cytosolic pyruvate, lactate alanine. pathway allows both, provide tricarboxylic acid cycle pyruvate molecules produced alternative substrates glucose and, generate reducing equivalents necessary operation NADPH requiring processes. cellular level, pyruvate recycling involves activity malic enzyme, combined activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase, well transporters inner mitochondrial membrane exchanging corresponding intermediates. cellular localization neuronal astrocytic compartments vivo brain controversial, evidences favoring either primarily neuronal glial localizations, recently accepted occur environments. review provides brief history detection characterization pathway, relations early developments cerebral high resolution (13)C NMR, potential neuroprotective functions hypoglycemic conditions ischemic redox stress.
