 Metabolic potential muscle development investigated relative habitat phylogeny seven species New Zealand triplefin fishes. Activity measured three principal glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase) two oxidative enzymes (citrate synthase L3-hydroxyacyl CoA:NAD(+) oxidoreductase). non-bicarbonate buffering capacity caudal muscle also estimated. Phylogenetic independent contrast analyses used reduce effects phylogenetic history analyses. positive relationship metabolic potential effective water velocity respective habitat depths found exclusion analyses semi-pelagic species Obliquichthys maryannae. O. maryannae showed high glycolytic enzyme activities, displayed double activity oxidative enzymes relative six benthic species. Histochemically stained sections taken immediately posterior vent showed adult O. maryannae larval Forsterygion lapillum significantly red muscle, smaller cross-sectional areas white red muscle fibres, adults benthic species. distribution red muscle adult O. maryannae resembled larval F. lapillum, differed typical teleost pattern seen adults six benthic species. adult O. maryannae larval F. lapillum expansive lateralis superficialis muscle, typical larval fish, encompasses much caudal trunk. Results suggest anaerobic potential New Zealand triplefins: (a) increases locomotory requirements different habitats, (b) displays negative relationship depth-dependent water velocities benthic species. O. maryannae appears increased aerobic potential sustained swimming paedomorphic retention larval muscle architecture.
