 report investigating methylglyoxal (MG) bypass animals, D-lactate produced triosephosphate via MG. Rats made diabetic using streptozotocin starved 72 h. D-Lactate various metabolites related it, L-lactate, pyruvate, methylglyoxal, glucose, inorganic phosphate, measured blood plasma, liver, skeletal muscle rats. Diabetic starved rats significantly higher levels D-lactate plasma, liver, skeletal muscle compared control group. contrast, pyruvate levels plasma, liver, skeletal muscle markedly lower normal diabetic starved rats. L-Lactate level lowered markedly plasma, liver, skeletal muscle starved rats elevated liver diabetic rats. Differences plasma L-lactate level diabetes control significant. MG level significantly elevated plasma depressed livers muscles starved rats well livers diabetic rats. Hepatic glycerol content markedly increased states. Enzyme activities related D- L-lactate, pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyoxalase I, measured livers rats. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased states, enzyme activities showed significant changes. D-Lactate much excreted L-lactate urine diabetic fasted rats compared normal rats.
