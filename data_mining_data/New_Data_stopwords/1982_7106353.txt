 1. Two experiments performed examine effects duodenal glucose infusion hepatic enzyme activities sheep. 2. Glucose infusion significantly increased specific activities phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase significantly reduced specific activity glucose-6-phosphatase suggesting pathways glucose breakdown increased, gluconeogenesis decreased, glucose-infused animals. 3. results discussed relation effects diet liver metabolism sheep.
