 5'-AMP aminohydrolase activities red blood cells normal human adults patients pseudohypertrophic dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, limb girdle dystrophy, neuromuscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie Tooth Disease, spinal muscular atrophy examined. contrast greatly decreased skeletal muscular levels 5'-AMP aminohydrolase observed Pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy, levels red blood cells patients significantly different normals. Pyruvate kinase creatine kinase activities determined comparative purposes. density distribution normal dystrophic erythrocytes essentially identical.
