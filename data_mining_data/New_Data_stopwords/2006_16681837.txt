 establish infection, pathogen Candida albicans must assimilate carbon grow mammalian host. fungus assimilates six-carbon compounds via glycolytic pathway, two-carbon compounds via glyoxylate cycle gluconeogenesis. address paradox regarding roles central metabolic pathways C. albicans pathogenesis: glyoxylate cycle apparently required virulence although glyoxylate cycle genes repressed glucose concentrations present bloodstream. Using GFP fusions, confirm glyoxylate cycle gluconeogenic genes C. albicans repressed physiologically relevant concentrations glucose, show genes inactive majority fungal cells infecting mouse kidney. However, pathways induced following phagocytosis macrophages neutrophils. contrast, glycolytic genes induced following phagocytosis expressed infected kidney. Mutations three pathways attenuate virulence fungus, highlighting importance central carbon metabolism establishment C. albicans infections. conclude C. albicans displays metabolic program whereby glyoxylate cycle gluconeogenesis activated early, pathogen phagocytosed host cells, subsequent progression systemic disease dependent upon glycolysis.
