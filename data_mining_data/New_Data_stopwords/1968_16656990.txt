 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase purified corn root tips 80-fold centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange gel filtration chromatography. resulting preparation essentially free malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate enzyme, NADH oxidase, pyruvate kinase activity. Kinetic analysis indicated l-malate noncompetitive inhibitor P-enolpyruvate carboxylase respect P-enolpyruvate (K(I) = 0.8 mm). d-Malate, aspartate, glutamate inhibited lesser extent; succinate, fumarate, pyruvate inhibit. Oxaloacetate also noncompetitive inhibitor P-enolpyruvate carboxylase apparent K(I) 0.4 mm. comparison oxaloacetate l-malate inhibition suggested mechanisms inhibition different. data indicated l-malate may regulate CO(2) fixation corn root tips feedback end product type inhibition.
