 PI3K/Akt pathway regulates various stress-related cellular responses cell survival, cell proliferation, metabolism protein synthesis. Many cancer cell types display activation pathway, compounds inhibiting cell survival pathway extensively evaluated anti-cancer agents. addition cancers, several human viruses, HTLV, HPV, HCV HIV-1, also modulate pathway, presumably order extend life span infected target cells productive viral replication. expression HIV-1 Tat protein exhibited cytoprotective effect macrophages human microglial cell line inhibiting negative regulator pathway, PTEN. cytoprotective effect HIV-1 appears contribute long-term survival persistent HIV-1 production human macrophage reservoirs. study exploited PI3K/Akt dependent cytoprotective effect Tat-expressing CHME5 cells. screened collection compounds known modulate inflammation, identified three novel compounds: Lancemaside A, Compound K Arctigenin abolished cytoprotective phenotype Tat-expressing CHME5 cells. three compounds antagonized kinase activity Akt. detailed signaling studies revealed three compounds targeted different steps PI3K/Akt pathway. Arctigenin regulates upstream PI3K enzyme converting PIP2 PIP3. Lancemaside A1 inhibited movement Akt plasma membrane, critical step Akt activation. Compound K inhibited Akt phosphorylation. study supports Tat-expressing CHME5 cells effective model system screening novel PI3K/Akt inhibitors.
