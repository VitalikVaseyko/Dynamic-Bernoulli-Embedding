 study performed determine whether M1 M2 pyruvate kinases synthesized direction one two messenger RNAs. compared M1 M2 pyruvate kinases purified fresh tissues neosynthesized direction messenger RNAs tissues synthesizing either M1 M2. RNA isolated rat muscle, lung, spleen kidney ethanol precipitation 7 guanidium chloride, translated rabbit reticulocyte system newly-synthesized pyruvate kinase subunits purified microimmunoaffinity chromatography. Pyruvate kinase fresh muscle spleen purified one step similar process. Muscle spleen RNA directed synthesis subunits molecular weights approx. 61000 62000, respectively, corresponding fresh tissue monomers. addition, peptide maps obtained partial digestion neosynthesized M1 M2 V8 protease Staphylococcus aureus confirmed polypeptides clearly different.
