 BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), key glycolytic enzyme, involved multiple cellular processes including apoptosis. Recently increased fecal PKM2 found Crohn's disease (CD), little known regarding function pathophysiology disease. AIM: intestinal expression PKM2 involvement CD investigated. METHODS: Pyruvate kinase M2 expression mucosal biopsies patients CD normal controls detected immunohistochemistry. murine model colitis induced trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) established expression PKM2, B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl), active caspase-3 well cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) examined association PKM2 intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis. Furthermore, treated human IEC line HT-29 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) used RNA interference analyze role PKM2 IEC apoptosis. RESULTS: Intestinal expression PKM2 higher patients CD compared normal controls mainly locating IECs. TNBS-induced colitis, up-regulation PKM2 accompanied elevated expression Bcl-xl, active caspase-3, cleaved PARP. PKM2 co-localized active caspase-3 IECs marked E-cadherin, suggesting role IEC apoptosis. Expression PKM2 Bcl-xl TNF-alpha-induced HT-29 cells increased, TNF-alpha effect cellular localization PKM2. Furthermore, knockdown PKM2 siRNA could inhibit expression Bcl-xl enhance apoptosis TNF-alpha-treated HT-29 cells. CONCLUSION: up-regulation PKM2 might protect IECs apoptosis possibly Bcl-xl CD, indicating important role pathophysiology CD.
