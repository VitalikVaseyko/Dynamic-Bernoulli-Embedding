 BACKGROUND: M2 pyruvate kinase (M2PK) oncoprotein secreted colorectal cancers stools. first report accuracy rapid stool test detection colorectal cancer (CRC). OBJECTIVE: determine sensitivity, specificity positive negative predictive value rapid, point care stool test M2 PK- M2PK Quick. METHODS: Consecutive cases endoscopically diagnosed histological proven CRC recruited. Stools collected patients tested immunochromatographic M2PK Quick Test (Schebo Biotech AC, Giessen, Germany). Controls consecutively chosen patients without significant colorectal gastrointestinal disease undergoing colonoscopy. CRC staged according AJCC staging manual (7th Edition) location tumor defined proximal distal. RESULTS: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value overall accuracy were: 93%, 97.5%, 94.9%, 96.5% 96.0% respectively. positive predictive value proximal tumors significantly lower compared distal tumors. differences seen different stages tumor. CONCLUSIONS: M2-PK Quick, rapid, point-of-care test highly accurate test detection CRC. easy convenient perform useful diagnostic test detection CRC clinical practice setting.
