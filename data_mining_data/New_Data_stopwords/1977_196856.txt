 Reaction ADP hexamethylene diisocyanate hexamethylphosphoramide followed treatment acidic medium afforded three new adenine nucleotide analogues, N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-ADP, N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-ATP, N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-AMP yields 13%, 12% 17%, respectively. occurrence ATP analogue may interpreted terms equilibrium, 2ADP = ATP + AMP. Coenzymic activities ADP analogue acetate kinase pyruvate kinase 82% 20%, respectively, relative ADP ATP analogue hexokinase glycerokinase 63% 87%, respectively, relative ATP. analogues bound CNBr-activated soluble dextran terminal amino group give immobilized ADP immobilized ATP, recycled system comprising acetate kinase hexokinase, placed membrane reactor together enzymes, functioned immobilized coenzyme continuously yielding glucose 6-phosphate. series chemically defined affinity adsorbents obtained coupling analogues CNBr-activated Sepharose, used separate enzymes mixture hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase.
