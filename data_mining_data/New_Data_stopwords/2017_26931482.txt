 Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases (PDKs) 1-4, expressed peripheral central tissues, regulate activity PDH complex (PDC). PDC important mitochondrial gatekeeping enzyme controls cellular metabolism. role PDKs diverse neurological disorders, including neurometabolic aberrations neurodegeneration, described. Implications role PDKs inflammation neurometabolic coupling led us investigate effect genetic ablation PDK2/4 nociception mouse model acute inflammatory pain. Deficiency Pdk2 and/or Pdk4 mice led attenuation formalin-induced nociceptive behaviors (flinching, licking, biting, lifting injected paw). Likewise, pharmacological inhibition PDKs substantially diminished nociceptive responses second phase formalin test. Furthermore, formalin-provoked paw edema formation mechanical thermal hypersensitivities significantly reduced Pdk2/4-deficient mice. Formalin-driven neutrophil recruitment site inflammation, spinal glial activation, neuronal sensitization substantially lessened second late phase formalin test Pdk2/4-deficient animals. Overall, results suggest PDK2/4 potential target development pharmacotherapy treatment acute inflammatory pain. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
