 studying early postmortem changes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) possible draw conclusions premortem focal brain cell injury terminal brain ischemia. Cisternal fluid (CF) 40 different adult cadavers known neurological disorder analyzed compared known vivo values. divided four groups (n = 10 group), CF samples taken 2, 4, 10, 24 h death. enzyme activity CK CK-BB (EC 2.7.3.2) increased linearly statistically significantly 4-24 h postmortem (P < 0.001) 2 h values already 10 20 times higher vivo, LD isoenzymes 1 3 (EC 1.1.1.27) distinctly 10 24 h death. Glucose pyruvate concentrations CF declined, Na+ Cl-. Lactate K+ increased time. earliest statistically significant changes different timepoints seen lactate, pyruvate K+ concentrations. GABA concentration already 170 times 2 h postmortem, glutamate 20 times higher vivo. concentrations alanine, glycine, lysine, histidine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine 2 3 times higher 2 h postmortem life. concentrations amino acids ammonia increased linearly statistically significantly (P < 0.001) CF 4 24 h postmortem.
