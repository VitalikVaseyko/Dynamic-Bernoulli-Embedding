 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction due coronary artery disease (CAD) may improve revascularization patients hibernating myocardium (HM). METHODS RESULTS: compared rate metabolic (arterial-great cardiac vein differences lactate, glucose pyruvate) functional (intra-operative transesophageal epicardial echocardiography) recovery occurrence oxidative stress (myocardial release oxidized glutathione (GSSG)) early surgical revascularization, patients CAD, LV dysfunction HM (n=16) vs preserved LV function (n=15). comparing two groups, observed that, de-clamping, patients HM (a) kinetic lactate production converted extraction (P<0.01 1, 5, 10 20 min revascularization), (b) myocardial extraction pyruvate increased (P<0.01 first 5 min revascularization), (c) GSSG release less shorter duration (P<0.01 times), (d) segmental wall motion score improved 2.4+/-0.3 1.7+/-0.5 (P<0.01) thickening akinetic territories corresponding antero-distal septum distal anterior wall regions (to 36+/-23%, 36+/-13%, respectively). correlation rate recovery metabolic functional indices. CONCLUSIONS: contractile metabolic recovery HM rapid non-HM, accompanied oxidative stress.
