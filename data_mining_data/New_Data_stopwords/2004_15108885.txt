 canine gracilis model used study muscle energy metabolism enzyme activities free vascularized muscle transfer. Fifteen male mongrel dogs underwent orthotopic, free transfer left gracilis microneurovascular anastomosis. minimum 10 months' recovery, muscle biopsy specimens obtained transfers contralateral controls analyzed relative fiber type areas maximum activities phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme dehydrogenase (HAD), creatine phosphokinase. Biopsy specimens obtained 10 minute, 20-Hz contraction analyzed glucose, glycogen, glycolytic intermediates, phosphocreatine, total creatine, adenine nucleotides (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, inosine monophosphate, inosine). significant transfer versus control difference type relative fiber area (45 +/- 4 percent versus 44 +/- 3 percent). Total creatine significantly reduced transferred muscles relative control (83.1 +/- 3.0 mmol/kg versus 100.6 +/- 5.1 mmol/kg dry weight). Maximal activities phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, HAD, creatine phosphokinase diminished transfers relative controls, although hexokinase activity significantly higher freely transferred gracilis muscles. 20-Hz contraction, muscle transfers produced less force initially, although force/time integral 10-minute stimulation similar transfers (277 +/- 25 N/g/second) controls (272 +/- 24 N/g/second). contraction associated significant glvcogen use lactate accumulation transfers controls, although less pronounced transfers. Glycolytic flux appeared muted transfers relative controls. Significant, similar high-energy phosphagen reductions inosine monophosphate accumulation noted contraction groups. Contractile activity associated expected pattern muscle metabolite changes following free vascularized transfer, indicating components cellular energy metabolism qualitatively altered microneurovascular muscle transfer. contrast, quantitative differences suggest free vascularized muscle transfer associated muscle enzyme profile consistent deconditioning presence denervated muscles fibers absence fiber type profile changes.
