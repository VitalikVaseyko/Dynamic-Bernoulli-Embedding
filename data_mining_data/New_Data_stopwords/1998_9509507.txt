 activity erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK), one important enzymes anaerobic glycolytic pathway, measured total 57 healthy (22 term 35 preterm) infants. mean PK activity 8.98 +/- 3.43 IU/gHb term 16.56 +/- 7.26 IU/gHb preterm infants. mean PK activity significantly higher preterm babies term infants (16.56 +/- 7.26 IU/gHb 8.98 +/- 3.43 IU/gHb, respectively) (P < .001). significant negative correlation found gestational age, birth weight, PK activity (r = 0.40, P < .05; r = -0.37, P < .05). correlation found postnatal age PK activity preterm term infants. increased PK activity preterm babies thought due increased glycolytic activity energy production infants.
