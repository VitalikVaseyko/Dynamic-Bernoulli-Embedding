 BHLHB2/DEC1 transcription factor implicated cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, also known play important role regulation mammalian circadian rhythm. However, precise role metabolism remains unclear. investigated link BHLHB2 ChREBP, glucose-activated transcription factor involved regulation lipogenesis. Glucose stimulation overexpression dominant active ChREBP induced Bhlhb2 mRNA expression rat hepatocytes. Deletion studies showed ChoRE (-160 -143bp) mouse Bhlhb2 promoter region functional vivo. Overexpression BHLHB2 inhibited glucose ChREBP-mediated induction rat Fasn liver pyruvate kinase (Lpk) mRNA. ChIP assay demonstrated BHLHB2 bound ChoRE Fasn, Lpk, Bhlhb2 promoter regions vivo. conclusion, BHLHB2 ChREBP constitute novel feedback loop involved regulation lipogenesis.
