 Previously established consequences abolishing pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity Escherichia coli aerobic growth glucose include reduced acetate production, elevated hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway flux, elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc) flux, increased ratio phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pyruvate. traits inspired two hypotheses. First, mutant (PB25) may maintain plasmid wild type (JM101) combining traits reported facilitate plasmid DNA synthesis (i.e., decreased Pyk flux increased HMP pathway Ppc fluxes). Second, PB25 likely possesses higher level cyclic AMP (cAMP) JM101. based reports connect elevated PEP/pyruvate ratios phosphotransferase system signaling adenylate cyclase activation. test first hypothesis, strains transformed pUC-based, high-copy-number plasmid (pGFPuv), copy numbers measured. PB25 exhibited fourfold-higher copy number JM101 grown 37 degrees C. 42 degrees C, plasmid content ninefold higher JM101 37 degrees C. test second hypothesis, cAMP measured, results confirmed higher PB25 JM101. elevation enough elicit strong regulatory effect, however, indicated comparative expression pGFPuv-based reporter gene, gfp(uv), control cAMP-responsive lac promoter. elevated cAMP PB25 suggests Pyk may participate glucose catabolite repression serving among factors tighten gene expression.
