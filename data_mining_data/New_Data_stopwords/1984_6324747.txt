 presence adenosine (25-250 microM) 2-chloroadenosine (2.5-100 microM) incubation medium caused marked decrease concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate isolated hepatocytes. effect accompanied increase concentration cyclic AMP, activation phosphorylase fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, inactivation pyruvate kinase 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. rule, changes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-modifying system slower persistent activities phosphorylase pyruvate kinase. effect nucleoside decrease concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate affected inhibitor adenosine transport could obtained liver high-speed supernatant. data indicate effect adenosine decrease concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate mediated stimulation adenylate cyclase, secondary binding adenosine membranous receptors. Like glucagon, 2-chloroadenosine stimulated gluconeogenesis isolated hepatocytes, whereas adenosine opposite effect.
