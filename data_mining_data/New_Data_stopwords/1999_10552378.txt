 Little known effects K(+) fertilization pyruvate kinase (PK) activities cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Brunex) grown greenhouse calcareous soils. Here, effect K rates concentrations K(+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+) PK activity possible indicator levels cations leaves fruits cucumber plants studied. treatments consisted applications three rates K form K(2)SO(4) (K1 = 0.075 mg mL(-)(1), K2 = 0.15 mg mL(-)(1), K3 = 0.30 mg mL(-)(1)). general, K(+) application calcareous soils proved beneficial. highest application K(+) (K3) culture medium reduced, leaves fruits, foliar concentrations Mg(2+) Ca(2+). results reflected lowest basal PK activities highest differences basal PK activity activities stimulated two cations. opposite effect resulted K2, maximal basal PK activity minimal differences activity activities stimulated cations, indicating better balance treatment different cations experimental conditions. Finally, trend might partly account highest commercial yield plants treated K2.
