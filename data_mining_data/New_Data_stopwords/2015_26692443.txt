 OBJECTIVES: currently reliable method predict risk relapse curative resection early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Increased glucose metabolism observed F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) malignant cells, Warburg effect, well-known characteristic malignant phenotype. investigated role glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT-1) gene expression, glucose cell plasma membrane transporter, early-stage pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Associations GLUT-1 gene expression PET maximum standardized uptake values histologic grade investigated early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Multivariate analysis conducted determine predictors prognosis. Cox proportional hazard model used survival analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients GLUT-1 gene analysis performed, 50 patients GLUT-1 analysis PET scan. Patients high GLUT-1 gene expression decreased overall survival univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard model (hazard ratio, 2.82; P = 0.001) remained significant multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.54; P = 0.03). correlation GLUT-1 gene expression histologic grade PET maximum standardized uptake values. CONCLUSIONS: Increased GLUT-1 gene expression associated decreased overall survival pancreatic adenocarcinoma. supports increased GLUT-1 gene expression potential prognostic marker resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
