 local anesthetic lidocaine induces cell death altering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation mitochondrial electron transport chain function. hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) involved determining oxygen metabolism mitochondria function, investigated involvement HIF-1 activity lidocaine-induced cell death. investigated role HIF activation lidocaine-induced caspase activation cell death renal cell-derived RCC4 cells lacking functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. demonstrate HIF-1 suppressed oxygen consumption facilitated glycolysis pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1-dependent manner activation HIF-1 conferred resistance lidocaine-induced cell death. also demonstrated exogenous HIF-1 activation, HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibition exposure hypoxic conditions, alleviates lidocaine toxicity suppressing mitochondria function generating ROS, RCC4 cells, also neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. conclusion, demonstrate HIF-1 activation due VHL deletion, treatment small molecule HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors, exposure hypoxic conditions suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain function confers resistance lidocaine toxicity.
