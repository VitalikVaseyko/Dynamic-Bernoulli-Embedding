 enzymes involved glycolysis readily reversible also active gluconeogenesis. However, three reaction steps irreversible, i.e., catalyzed hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase; reactions occurs large negative free-energy change, reactions thus bypassed alternate enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40, PK) plays important role controlling glycolysis gluconeogenesis. clarify characteristics glycolysis dental pulp, examined enzymatic properties pyruvate kinase pig dental pulp compared enzyme pig brain. 1) Pyruvate kinase dental pulp brain purified use ammonium sulphate fractionation, phosphocellulose colum chromatography, isoelectric focusing. prepared enzymes showed single protein band SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2) subunit molecular weight dental pulp brain enzymes determined 63,000 59,000, respectively. 3) Substrate inhibition dental pulp brain enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate observed, relationship reaction velocity substrate concentration pH 7.2 explained Michaelis-Menten equation. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate observable effect either enzyme. 4) Effect amino acids dental pulp brain enzyme activity examined, significant relationship observed side chain structure amino acids potency inhibiting dental pulp brain enzyme activity. Glutamic aspartic acids markedly inhibited dental pulp brain enzymes pH 7.2. 5) Oxalate showed inhibitory activity dental pulp brain enzymes, Ki value determined 50 microM 80 microM, respectively. inhibition dental pulp brain enzyme activity oxalate competitive respect phosphoenolpyruvate. 6) dental pulp brain enzymes clearly inhibited malate concentrations higher 1.0 mM: 50% 100% inhibition occurred 2.2-2.3 mM 3.0 mM malate, respectively.
