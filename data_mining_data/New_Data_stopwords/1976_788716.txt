 submersion, cardiovascular system naturally diving animals virtually transformed heart-brain-lung preparation result intense highly selective neurogenic vasoconstriction. supply oxygen circulating blood cells heart brain thereby secured. Peripheral tissues, e.g. muscles kidneys, depend local stores oxygen, i.e. myoglobin, or, exhausted, anaerobic metabolism. spite physiological adjustments, however, arterial pO2 inevitably decrease throughout underwater episode. prolonged dives values lower 10mmHg observed. Moreover, ischaemia peripheral tissues will, animals, e.g. arctic seals whales, result profound decrease temperature tissues skin. aim present report review important biochemical mechanisms allow diving mammals birds cope above-mentioned combined asphyxic temperature stresses prolonged periods. osmotic problems arising rapid wash-out acidic metabolic end products previously ischaemic tissues emergence also discussed.
