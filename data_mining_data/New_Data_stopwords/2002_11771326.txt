 Enzymatic activities ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (EC 4.1.1.39), phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), NAD malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), NADP glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase complex including phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13) comparatively assayed wheat seedlings cultivar Lyutestsens 758 grown normal conditions, water deficiency conditions, subsequent rehydration. Water stress found decrease activity enzymes tested, effect pronounced case Rubisco. content Rubisco wheat plants exposed water deficiency reduced less significantly activity enzyme. Preliminary treatment plant seeds kartolin-4 (o-isopropyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl carbamate), preparation cytokinin activity, reduced dehydration-induced inhibition enzymatic activity. Upon subsequent rehydration, kartolin-4 facilitated rapid recovery photosynthetic activity, process based kartolin-induced stimulation reparation reactions. conditions water stress, partial decrease activity carbon metabolism enzymes vitro accompanied complete inhibition photosynthesis vivo, perhaps, result abrupt increase stomatal resistance.
