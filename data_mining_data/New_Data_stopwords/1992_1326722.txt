 studied vivo biochemical effects insulin skeletal muscle chronically uremic control rats. rate disappearance blood glucose (determined short intravenous test) reduced 38% uremia (p less 0.05). Intraperitoneal treatment insulin plus glucose 30 min caused 3-fold increase activity insulin receptor tyrosine kinase skeletal muscle rat groups. Conversely, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased 115% controls 26% uremics (p less 0.01). Exercise (swimming 30 min) increased muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase activity approximately 2-fold groups animals. experiments show uremic rats, insulin binds normally muscle receptors adequately activates receptor tyrosine kinase fails activate otherwise responsive pyruvate dehydrogenase.
