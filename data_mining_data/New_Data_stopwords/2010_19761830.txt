 monofunctional analog chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (HD), 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), induces tissue damage similar HD. Herein studied molecular mechanisms associated CEES-induced skin inflammation toxicity SKH-1 hairless mice. Topical CEES exposure caused increase oxidative stress observed enhanced 4-hydroxynonenal 5,5-dimethyl-2-(8-octanoic acid)-1-pyrroline N-oxide protein adduct formation increase protein oxidation. CEES-induced increase formation 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine indicated DNA oxidation. CEES exposure instigated increase phosphorylation mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; ERK1/2, JNK, p38). CEES exposure, significant increase phosphorylation Akt Ser473 Thr308 observed well upregulation upstream effector, PDK1, mouse skin tissue. Subsequently, CEES exposure caused activation AP-1 family proteins NF-kappaB pathway, including phosphorylation degradation IkappaBalpha addition phosphorylation NF-kappaB essential modulator. Collectively, results indicate CEES induces oxidative stress activation transcription factors AP-1 NF-kappaB via upstream signaling pathways including MAPKs Akt SKH-1 hairless mouse skin. novel molecular targets could supportive development prophylactic therapeutic interventions HD-related skin injury.
