 Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase catalyzes hydrolysis P-enolpyruvate active site catalyzes physiologically important kinase reaction. hydrolase activity lower kinase activity factor least 10(3). specific monovalent cation divalent cation requirements. cofactors required. relative activation pyruvate kinase hydrolase reaction is: Ni(II) greater Co(II) greater Mg(II) greater Mn(II). parallels rates nonenzymatic hydrolysis P-enolpyruvate (Benkovic, S.J., Schray, K.J. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 4097-4102). pH rate profiles hydrolase kinase reactions activated Ni(II) Co(II) similar, suggesting common features mechanisms. contrast kinase reaction, reaction velocity hydrolase increases high Co(II) concentrations indicating second mode hydrolysis.
