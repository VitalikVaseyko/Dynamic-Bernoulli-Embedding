 initiation development fundamental infectious processes parasitic nematodes. examined early developmental activation Trichinella spiralis larvae host invasion, particular emphasis timing events. Using novel approach, observed changes tissue-specific transcriptional activity live larvae infectious process fluorescent nucleic acid dyes SYTO12 acridine orange. Simultaneously, metabolic switch anaerobic metabolism, characteristics infective stage, aerobic metabolism, found enteral stages, tracked measuring activities key regulatory enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pyruvate kinase, well isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) activity, used co-indicator developmental activation. metabolic enzyme activities transcription patterns found change response host death, liberation nurse cell, exposure components host stomach environment. results give clear indication activation processes T. spiralis infective larvae occur much earlier time previously thought, stimulated upon liberation larvae nurse cell inside host stomach.
