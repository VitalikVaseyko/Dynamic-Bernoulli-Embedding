 cytosol enzymatic study case high L-malic acid(LMA) production Aspergillus sp. N1-14' reported. activities 4 kind enzymes catalyse CO2 fixation reactions detected, pyruvate carboxylase(PC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxlase (PEPC), phosphoenolpyurvate carboxykinase(PCK) malic enzyme(ME). exception ME, linear correlation found activities three carboxlases production rate LMA. activity malate dehydrogenase(MDH) level 2-3 exponential higher analysed enzymes, activity succinate dehydrogenase(SDH) much lower, discrepancy, SDH positive correlation content LMA fermenting slurry(r = 0.9252). shown accumulated LMA acted activator SDH. dynamic study, found that, contrast slow even increase biomass, content cytosol protein(Cp) sharply fluctuated mainly due changes aeration conditions. data linear correlation coefficients(r) activities cytosol enzymes Cp(PC r = 0.9563, PEPC r = 0.7688, PCK r = 0.7300, MDH r = 0.3920, SDH r = -0.2086) exhibited inner law protein synthesis. Experiment increasing amount spore inoculum resulted increase LMA decrease SA. fermenting 120 h 5 L stirred fermentor, 3-fold original spore inoculum 105.88 g/L LMA achieved, overall productivity 0.883 g/(L.h), converting rate glucose LMA 78.43%. result supports exist inner law protein synthesis early period LMA fermentation Aspergillus sp.
