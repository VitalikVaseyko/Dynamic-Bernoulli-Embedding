 Addition commonly used anesthetic pentobarbital hepatocytes fed rats resulted dose-dependent decrease level fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. concentration pentobarbital (0.4 mM) lowered fructose 2,6-bisphosphate 60%, significant change level fructose 6-phosphate, ATP, L-glycerol 3-phosphate. Higher concentrations pentobarbital (2 mM) enhanced glycolysis glycogenolysis fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels reduced less 10% control. Concomitant changes decrease ATP, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate two- fivefold increase ADP AMP, respectively. hepatocytes starved rats pentobarbital also lowered ATP levels inhibited gluconeogenesis effect either lactate production already low level sugar diphosphate. However, fasted case pentobarbital completely prevented 10-fold elevation fructose 2,6-bisphosphate brought 30 mM glucose. anesthetic effect cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity pyruvate kinase activity hepatocytes fed starved rats caused reciprocal changes activities bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. Kinase activity decreased bisphosphatase activity increased. results suggest effects pentobarbital gluconeogenesis glycolysis due inhibition energy metabolism elevated AMP levels causing activation 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase inhibition fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED 250 WORDS)
