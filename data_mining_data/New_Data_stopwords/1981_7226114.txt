 Primary breast cancers 54 patients undergoing postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy analyzed several enzymes estrogen receptors determine biochemical parameters might offer prognostic index determining outcome therapy. Recurrence disease therapy within 12 months cessation therapy criterion classifying patient treatment failure. Recurrence rates similar ER-positive vs. ER-negative patients, indicating estrogen receptor status offered predictive value series. However, patients failed therapy tumors displayed significantly lower activities lactate dehydrogenase, glucosephosphate isomerase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase vs. patients showed evidence recurrence observation period. either premenopausal ER-negative patients compared, similar observation made; low enzyme activities occurred patients failing benefit adjuvant chemotherapy. Based series patients, suggested selected enzyme activity profile may offer predictive index recurrence adjuvant chemotherapy setting.
