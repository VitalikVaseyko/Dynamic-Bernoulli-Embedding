 Two insulin mediators, inositol phosphoglycans, isolated bovine liver methods previously developed rat liver, i.e. chromatography AG 1 x 8 ion exchange column selective elution HCl pH 2.0 1.3. pH 2.0 mediator containing D-chiroinositol stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, whereas pH 1.3 mediator containing myo-inositol inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase. mediator purified thin layer Bio-Gel P4 column chromatography injected ip normal fed rats together [U-14C]glucose. 2.5 h, diaphragms removed, glycogen isolated. Insulin mediators, like insulin, stimulated [U-14C]glucose incorporation glycogen 150-160% dose-dependent manner nanomolar range. Mediators injected iv nanomolar range low dose streptozotocin-diabetic rats decreased plasma glucose 30-45% 30-60 min, return basal concentrations 150-180 min. vivo insulin-like effects mediator observed without changes serum insulin concentrations. pH 2.0 mediator 50-100 times active (per nmol organic phosphate) pH 1.3 mediator ip diaphragm glycogenesis assay. Mediator effects diaphragm completely blocked preincubation immunopurified inositol phosphoglycan antibody. mediators equally active iv lowering plasma glucose (per nmol inositol) concentrations comparable insulin.
