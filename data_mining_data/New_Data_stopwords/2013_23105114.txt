 Retinoic acid (RA) regulates gene transcription activating nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta respective cognate lipid-binding proteins CRABP-II FABP5. RA induces neuronal differentiation, contributions two transcriptional pathways hormone process unknown. Here, show RA-induced commitment P19 stem cells neuronal progenitors mediated CRABP-II/RAR path FABP5/PPARbeta/delta path inhibit process induction RAR repressors SIRT1 Ajuba. contrast inhibitory activity early steps neurogenesis, FABP5/PPARbeta/delta path promotes differentiation neuronal progenitors mature neurons, activity mediated part PPARbeta/delta target gene PDK1. Hence, RA-induced neuronal differentiation mediated RAR early stages PPARbeta/delta late stages process. switch RA signaling accomplished transient up-regulation RARbeta concomitantly transient increase CRABP-II/FABP5 ratio early stages differentiation. accordance conclusions, hippocampi FABP5-null mice display excess accumulation neuronal progenitor cells deficit mature neurons versus wild-type animals.
