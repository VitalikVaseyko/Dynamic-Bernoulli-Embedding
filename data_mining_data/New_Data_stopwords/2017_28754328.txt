 BACKGROUND: pathogenesis gut inflammation, bacterial dysbiosis increased rates malignancy CF unclear. Fecal M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) biomarker indicative cellular proliferation may raised intestinal malignancy inflammation. Biomarkers, including M2-PK, may useful assessing effects novel therapies gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: M2-PK measured stools collected patients CF HC (0-10years). Linear mixed model analysis used. RESULTS: M2-PK levels significantly change children CF (36 patients, 77 samples) (P=0.998) HC (45 patients, 45 samples) (P=0.21), age range 0-10years. Patients CF elevated M2-PK compared HC (median [IQR; range]: 10.7 [5.7-28.6; 1.0-239.1] (n=77) vs. 1.0 [1.0-1.0; 1.0-50.0] (n=45) U/mL, respectively; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Fecal M2-PK elevated children CF compared HC infancy throughout childhood suggesting abnormalities CF gut exist early life.
