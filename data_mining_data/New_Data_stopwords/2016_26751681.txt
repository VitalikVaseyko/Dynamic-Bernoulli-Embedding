 Infection white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) induces metabolic shift shrimp resembles "Warburg effect" mammalian cells. effect triggered via activation PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, usually accompanied activation metabolic pathways provide energy direct flow carbon nitrogen. show unlike glutamine metabolism (glutaminolysis) seen cancer cells double deaminate glutamine produce glutamate TCA cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), WSSV genome replication stage (12 hpi), although glutaminase (GLS) expression upregulated, glutamate taken hemocytes WSSV-infected shrimp. time, observed increase activity two enzymes convert glutamate alpha-KG, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). alpha-ketoglutarate concentration also increased. series inhibition experiments suggested up-regulation GDH regulated mTORC2, PI3K-mTORC1 pathway involved. Suppression GDH ASAT dsRNA silencing showed enzymes important WSSV replication. GDH-silenced shrimp, direct replenishment alpha-KG rescued ATP production WSSV replication. results, propose model glutamate-driven anaplerosis fuels TCA cycle via alpha-KG ultimately supports WSSV replication.
