 5 h treatment glucagon, liver L-type pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.40) showed significant decrease K0.5 Hill coefficient (nH) absence fructose 1,6-diphosphate. However, presence fructose 1,6-diphosphate, liver enzymes treated rats showed slight decrease K0.5 nH remained unchanged. circumstances, changes Vmax observed treatment. changes kinetic properties liver L-type pyruvate kinase consistent dephosphorylation enzyme caused insulin release response treatment glucagon.
