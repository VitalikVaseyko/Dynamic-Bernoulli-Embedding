 Plant cells unique contain four species alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex: plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate) dehydrogenase, branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase. complexes include multiple copies three components: alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase/decarboxylase, dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex additionally includes intrinsic regulatory protein-kinase -phosphatase enzymes. acyltransferases form intricate geometric core structures complexes. Substrate channeling plus active-site coupling combine greatly enhance catalytic efficiency complexes. alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes occupy key positions intermediary metabolism, basic understanding properties critical genetic metabolic engineering. current status knowledge biochemical, regulatory, structural, genomic, evolutionary aspects fascinating multienzyme complexes reviewed.
