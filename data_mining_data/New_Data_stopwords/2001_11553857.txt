 M2 isoenzyme pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) specifically expressed tumor cells (TU M2-PK) may therefore provide tumor marker malignancies. investigated plasma concentrations TU M2-PK patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC), transitional cell carcinoma bladder (BCA), prostate cancer (PCA) benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). TU M2-PK quantified commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Using ELISA kit, plasma samples 57 healthy individuals compared 63 patients RCC, 36 patients BCA, 58 patients PCA 28 patients BPH. Patients carcinomas subdivided patients nonmetastatic metastatic disease. patients RCC (nonmetastatic metastatic) showed significantly increased concentrations TU M2-PK compared normal individuals. metastatic RCC, TU M2-PK levels highest also significantly enhanced compared nonmetastatic RCC. sensitivity nonmetastatic RCC 27.5% metastatic RCC 66.7% 95% reference value control group. BCA, PCA BPH, significant differences could detected. results indicate TU M2-PK concentrations plasma may potential biomarker advanced RCC.
