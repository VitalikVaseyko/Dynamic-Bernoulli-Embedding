 kinetic behavior reconstituted eyzyme system containing purified phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase investigated. Experimentally approach based stirred flow-through reactor containing gel entrapped enzymes. experiments performed basis mathematical model developed kinetic properties individual enzymes involved. system able exhibit alternative stable stationary states one set experimental conditions (bistability) originating mainly allosteric character phosphofructokinase. functional point view, states either ATP-generating ATP-consuming. Theoretically, appearance alternate steady states gives rise hysteretic behavior system. fact, transitions alternate ATP generating stationary states well ATP-generating ATP-consuming steady states observed experimentally.
