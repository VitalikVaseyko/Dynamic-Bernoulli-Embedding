 dependence pyruvate kinase reaction rate concentration one ligands--ADP MgCl2--at constant concentrations ligand studied. enzyme activity vs ligand concentration curves fairly symmetrical peaks correspond range approximately equal ligand concentrations. S-shaped dependence observed range concentrations close dissociation constant Mg-ADP- complex (0.7 mM) given experimental conditions. data obtained consistent results first model kinetics within framework London-Steck theory. substrate pyruvate kinase Mg-ADP- complex, free Mg2+ ADP3- competitively inhibit enzyme. inhibition constants equal 44 1 mM, respectively. inhibiting effects metal dinucleotide may due competition substrate enzyme active site. Taking consideration fact binding one ligands enzyme depends presence ligand, conclusion drawn Mg2+ forms bridge ADP3- pyruvate kinase adrenal cortex.
