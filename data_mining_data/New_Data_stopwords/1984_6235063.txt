 order study three regulator enzymes glycolysis, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) pyruvate kinase (PK), relation lymphocyte maturation, lymphocytes different origin investigated. Lymphocytes bone marrow, thymus, cord blood, adult peripheral blood mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes investigated. enzyme activities determined isozyme patterns studied means electrophoresis, kinetic measurements immunoprecipitation. young lymphocytes bone marrow mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes could distinguished lymphocytes higher residual HK activity presence inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate. Peripheral blood lymphocytes differed non-T lymphocytes PK isozymes distribution. cells contained PK type K4 hybrid K3M. cells smaller amount K isozyme seen non-T cells. PK residual activity presence alanine significantly higher peripheral blood cells non-T cells. Thymocytes characterised larger amount PFK M-subunits peripheral blood non-T lymphocytes. stimulation PFK positive effector glucose-1,6-diphosphate higher thymocytes peripheral blood lymphocytes.
