 PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates many cellular processes, especially cell metabolism, cell survival, apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), product PI3K activity key signaling molecule, acts recruiting pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain-containing proteins cell membranes. Here, describe new structural class nonphosphoinositide small molecule antagonists (PITenins, PITs) PIP3-PH domain interactions (IC(50) ranges 13.4 31 muM PIP3/Akt PH domain binding assay). PITs inhibit interactions number PIP3-binding PH domains, including Akt PDK1, without affecting several PIP2-selective PH domains. result, PITs suppress PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway trigger metabolic stress apoptosis. PIT-1 analog displayed significant antitumor activity vivo, including inhibition tumor growth induction apoptosis. Overall, studies demonstrate feasibility developing specific small molecule antagonists PIP3 signaling.
