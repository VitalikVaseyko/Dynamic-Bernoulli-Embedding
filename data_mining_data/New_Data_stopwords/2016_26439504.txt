 PURPOSE: Recently, enzymes serine synthetic pathway (SSP) suggested key player metabolic adaptation oncogenesis. assessed expression enzymes SSP colonic tumor tissue (TT) paired normal tissue (pNT) prognostic implications. METHODS: 2006 2010, included 486 patients colon cancer underwent curative surgery Kyungpook National University Hospital. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, PDK2, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) expression investigated immunohistochemical staining (IHC) TT pNT. IHC values calculated multiplying intensity proportion. final score classified follows: 0-2 negative 3-12 positive. RESULTS: median follow-up duration 55.5 months (37.4-90.6), 78 patients experienced recurrence. expression PHGDH, PDK1, PSAT significantly higher TT pNT (p < 0.001 each). univariate analysis relapse-free survival revealed TT PDK2 positivity positive prognostic factor (p = 0.023). However, expression TT PDK2 represent prognostic value multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: conclusion, PHGDH, PDK1, PSAT significantly increased colonic TT compared pNT. prognostic implication enzymes needs investigated.
