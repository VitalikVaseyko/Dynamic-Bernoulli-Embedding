 Tradeoffs hypoxia tolerance aerobic exercise performance appear exist fish taxa, even though traits often associated high O2 transport capacity. examined physiological basis potential tradeoff four species sunfish family Centrarchidae. Hypoxia tolerance greatest rock bass, intermediate pumpkinseed bluegill lowest largemouth bass, based measurements critical O2 tension (Pcrit) O2 tension loss equilibrium (PO2 LOE). Consistent tradeoff hypoxia tolerance aerobic exercise capacity, least hypoxia-tolerant species highest critical swimming speed (Ucrit) normoxia suffered greatest decrease Ucrit hypoxia. also positive correlation Ucrit normoxia PO2 LOE, remained significant accounting phylogeny using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Several sub-organismal traits appeared contribute hypoxia tolerance aerobic exercise capacity (reflected traits highest rock bass largemouth bass), gas-exchange surface area gills, pH sensitivity haemoglobin-O2 affinity, activities lactate dehydrogenase gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase liver. sub-organismal traits uniquely associated either hypoxia tolerance (low sensitivity haemoglobin-O2 affinity organic phosphates, high pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase activities heart) aerobic exercise capacity (capillarity fibre size axial swimming muscle). Therefore, cumulative influence variety respiratory metabolic traits result physiological tradeoffs associated evolution hypoxia tolerance aerobic exercise performance fish.
