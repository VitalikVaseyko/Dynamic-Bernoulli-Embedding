 Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency described first time three apparently unrelated West Highland white terriers (WHWT) Ireland UK. three dogs diagnosed markedly regenerative persistent anaemia treated presumed immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) hereditary erythrocyte PK-deficiency confirmed breed-specific DNA mutation analysis. hereditary erythroenzymopathy causes haemolytic anaemia affects several canine breeds varying degrees severity. Although eventually causing osteosclerosis, haemosiderosis death, PK-deficient dogs adapt anaemia many years.PK-deficiency considered anaemic WHWTs worldwide particularly dogs haemolytic anaemia evidence immune-mediated, infectious toxic underlying cause lacking.
