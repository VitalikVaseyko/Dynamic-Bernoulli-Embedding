 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) rare yet fatal condition characterized continuous notable elevation pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), resulting right heart failure death. Pulmonary arterial remodelling result abnormal proliferation pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (PAEC) dysfunction. However, pathological mechanism two types vascular cells pulmonary artery remodelling unclear. Warburg effect describes aerobic glycolysis wherein cells commonly reprogram energy metabolism preferentially utilize glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation ATP production. Recent research demonstrated Warburg effect plays significant role development PAH, involves abnormal proliferation PASMCs endothelial dysfunction. review attempts illustrate functions Warburg effect PAH, may provide new therapeutic target PAH treatment.
