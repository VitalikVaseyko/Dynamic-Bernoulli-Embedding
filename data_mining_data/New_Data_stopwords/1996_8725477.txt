 METHOD: ATP level activities hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) pyruvate kinase (PK) red blood cells (RBC) measured 50 school students 6-12 yr age Jordan Valley (JV) lowest region sea level world (low altitude: 390 sea level, hyperoxic average daily value 796 mmHg barometric pressure) 50 school students age group Irbid region (normal altitude: 600 sea level average daily value 600 mmHg barometric pressure). parameters measured also 40 school students sea level. RESULTS: significant decrease HK PFK-1 activities increase ATP level low altitude region, significant change PK activity JV-group compared Irbid sea level control groups. Possible explanations discussed interpret observations.
