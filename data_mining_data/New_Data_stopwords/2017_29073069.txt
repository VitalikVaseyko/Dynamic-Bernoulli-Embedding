 Aberrant alternative splicing epigenetic changes associated various cancers, epigenetic regulation alternative splicing cancer largely unknown. report intragenic DNA methylation-mediated binding Brother Regulator Imprinted Sites (BORIS) alternative exon Pyruvate Kinase (PKM) associated cancer-specific splicing promotes Warburg effect breast cancer progression. Interestingly, inhibition DNA methylation, BORIS depletion, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion BORIS binding site leads splicing switch cancer-specific PKM2 normal PKM1 isoform. results reversal Warburg effect inhibition breast cancer cell growth, may serve useful approach inhibit growth breast cancer cells. Importantly, results show addition PKM splicing, BORIS also regulates alternative splicing several genes DNA methylation-dependent manner. findings highlight role intragenic DNA methylation DNA binding protein BORIS cancer-specific splicing role tumorigenesis.
