 Chronic cholestasis characterized mitochondrial dysfunction, associated loss mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased activities respiratory chain complexes, ATP production. aim determine molecular mechanisms link long-term cholestasis mitochondrial dysfunction. studied model chronic cholestasis induced bile duct ligation rats. Key sensors regulators energetic state mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-to-nuclear DNA (nDNA) ratio (mtDNA/nDNA) relative copy number, mtDNA deletions, indexes apoptosis (BAX, BCL-2, cleaved caspase 3) cell proliferation (PCNA) evaluated. results show long-term cholestasis associated absence activation key sensors energetic state, evidenced decreased SIRT1 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase levels lack AMPK activation. Key mitochondrial biogenesis regulators (PGC-1alpha GABP-alpha) decreased NRF-1 transcriptionally active. Mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) protein levels increased transiently liver mitochondria 2 wk bile duct ligation, dramatically decreased 4 wk. Reduced TFAM levels stage mirrored marked decrease (65%) mtDNA/nDNA relative copy number. blockade mitochondrial biogenesis ascribed activation apoptosis inhibition cell proliferation. Impaired mitochondrial turnover loss DNA stabilizing effect TFAM likely causative event involved genetic instability evidenced accumulation mtDNA deletions. conclusion, lack stimulation mitochondrial biogenesis leads mtDNA severe depletion deletions long-term cholestasis. Hence, long-term cholestasis considered secondary mitochondrial hepatopathy.
