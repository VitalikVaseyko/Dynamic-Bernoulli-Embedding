 WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) encodes tumor suppressor frequently lost many cancer types. Wwox-deficient mice develop normally succumb lethal hypoglycemia early life. Here, identify WWOX tumor suppressor emerging role regulation aerobic glycolysis. WWOX controls glycolytic genes' expression hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) regulation. Specifically, WWOX, via first WW domain, physically interacts HIF1alpha modulates levels transactivation function. Consistent notion, Wwox-deficient cells exhibited increased HIF1alpha levels activity displayed increased glucose uptake. Remarkably, WWOX deficiency associated enhanced glycolysis diminished mitochondrial respiration, conditions resembling 'Warburg effect'. Furthermore, Wwox-deficient cells tumorigenic display increased levels GLUT1 vivo. Finally, WWOX expression inversely correlated GLUT1 levels breast cancer samples highlighting WWOX modulator cancer metabolism. studies uncover unforeseen role tumor-suppressor WWOX cancer metabolism.
