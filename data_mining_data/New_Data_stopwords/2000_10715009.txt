 Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) Thermoproteus tenax purified homogeneity, coding gene cloned expressed Escherichia coli. represents homomeric tetramer molecular mass 49 kDa per subunit. PK exhibits positive binding cooperativity respect phosphoenolpyruvate metal ions Mg(2+) Mn(2+). Heterotropic effects, commonly found PKs bacterial eucaryal sources, could detected. enzyme depend K(+) ions. Heterotrophically grown cells exhibit specific activity PK four times higher autotrophically grown cells. Since mRNA level PK coding gene also accordingly higher heterotrophic cells, conclude PK activity adjusted growth conditions mainly transcript level. enzymic properties PK regulation expression discussed respect physiological framework given T. tenax-specific variant Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. T. tenax PK shows moderate overall sequence similarity (25 40% identity) bacterial eucaryal pendants. Phylogenetic analyses known PK sequences result dichotomic tree topology divides enzymes two major PK clusters, probably diverged early gene duplication event. phylogenetic divergence paralleled striking phenotypic differentiation PKs: PKs cluster I, occur eucaryal cytoplasm, gamma proteobacteria, low-GC gram-positive bacteria, active presence fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphorylated sugars, whereas PKs cluster II, found various bacterial phyla, plastids, Archaea, show activity without effectors commonly regulated energy charge cell.
