 INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) two diseases affect pregnant women unborn children. diseases cause low birth weight, pre-term delivery, neurological cardiovascular disorders babies. Combined account 20% preterm deliveries. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) metabolism enzyme found developing embryonic cancer tissues. objective determine expression PKM2 human PE IUGR compared normal pregnancies. Understanding expression PKM2 PE IUGR could help us better understand mechanisms find treatments PE IUGR. METHODS: Human placental tissues obtained PKM2 determination analyzed immunohistochemistry, Western blot, pyruvate assay. Placental samples homogenized cytoplasmic nuclear proteins extracted Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Preeclampsia samples elevated levels p-PKM2, p-ERK, ERK cytoplasm. Beta-catenin lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) also elevated preeclampsia placenta samples. DISCUSSION CONCLUSION: conclude PKM2 expressed normal, PE IUGR pregnancies. Also, expression increased PE placenta delivery. results suggest placental metabolism PKM2 could play role human preeclampsia.
