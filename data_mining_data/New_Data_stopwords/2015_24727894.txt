 Mutations Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway essential roles development cancer. Although beta-catenin adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations well established known drive tumorigenesis, discoveries mutations components pathway lagged, hinders understanding cancer mechanisms. report delta-catenin (gene designation: CTNND2), primarily neural member beta-catenin superfamily promotes canonical Wnt/beta-catenin/LEF-1-mediated transcription, displays exonic mutations human prostate cancer promotes cancer cell survival adaptation metabolic reprogramming. overexpressed cells derived prostate tumor xenografts, delta-catenin gene invariably gives rise mutations, leading sequence disruptions predicting functional alterations. Ectopic delta-catenin gene integrating host chromosomes locus nonselective. delta-Catenin mutations promote tumor development mouse prostate probasin promoter (ARR2PB)-driven, prostate-specific expression Myc oncogene, whereas mutant cells empower survival advantage upon overgrowth glucose deprivation. Reprogramming energy utilization accompanies downregulation glucose transporter-1 poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage preserving tumor type 2 pyruvate kinase expression. delta-Catenin mutations increase beta-catenin translocation nucleus hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression. Therefore, introducing delta-catenin mutations important milestone prostate cancer metabolic adaptation modulating beta-catenin HIF-1alpha signaling glucose shortage amplify tumor-promoting potential.
