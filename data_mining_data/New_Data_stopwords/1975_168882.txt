 1. mechanism insulin activates pyruvate dehydrogenase rat epididymal adipose tissue investigated. 2. crude extracts, prepared tissue segments previously exposed insulin (2m-i.u/ml) 2min, supplemented Mg-2+, Ca-2+, glucose hexokinase incubated 30 degrees C, displayed enhanced rate increase pyruvate dehydrogenase activity compared control extracts. 3. similar extracts instead supplemented fluoride, ADP, creatine phosphate creatine kinase, rate decrease pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed incubation 30 degrees C unaffected insulin treatment. 4. suggested insulin increases fraction pyruvate dehydrogenase present tissue active dephospho form increasing activity pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase.
