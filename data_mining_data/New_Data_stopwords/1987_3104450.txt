 situ hybridization tissue sections used detect mRNAs present low concentrations metabolic adaptation azo dye carcinogenesis rat liver. method consisted hybridizing slices relatively high stringency [35S]-labeled single-stranded probes derived cDNA insert clones M13 phage. L-pyruvate kinase mRNA proved present low concentrations hepatocytes fasted rats relatively abundant hepatocytes 18 hr refeeding carbohydrate-rich diet. Aldolase mRNA concentrations previously shown increase markedly liver 3'-methyl DAB-fed rats, maximum fourth week. demonstrate here, using situ hybridization technique, phenomenon due re-expression "fetal marker" hepatocytes abundancy proliferating small cells (i.e., so-called oval transitional cells). Small amounts also detected sinusoidal cells. normal liver, aldolase mRNAs detected sinusoidal cells.
