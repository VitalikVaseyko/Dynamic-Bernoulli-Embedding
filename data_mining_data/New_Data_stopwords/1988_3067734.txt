 long-term influence triiodothyronine (T3) insulin glycolysis, glycolytic/gluconeogenic enzymes insulin responsiveness sensitivity investigated rat hepatocytes cultured 48 h without T3, 10 microM T3, 10nM insulin insulin plus T3. 48 h-51 h basal glycolysis ([14C]lactate formation [14C]glucose) measured absence short-term insulin-stimulated glycolysis presence 100 nM insulin. 1) T3 addition 48 h significant influence basal insulin-stimulated glycolysis. 2) Insulin addition 48 h increased basal glycolysis 300%, insulin-stimulated glycolysis 160%. 3) T3 plus insulin addition 48 h elevated basal glycolysis 560% insulin-stimulated glycolysis 230%. 4) 48-h treatment T3 change glucokinase (GK) pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, yet increased phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity 150%. 5) 48-h treatment insulin well T3 plus insulin enhanced GK 200% PK 140% decreased PEPCK 65%. 6) long-term effect T3 glycolysis maximal initial concentrations 100 nM. 7) long-term treatment T3 alter short-term responsiveness sensitivity glycolysis insulin, neither cells euthyroid hypothyroid rats. present results allow conclusion T3 permissive effect long-term increase glycolysis insulin, T3 exerted function altering neither cellular content key enzymes short-term insulin responsiveness sensitivity.
