 Corynebacterium glutamicum metabolically engineered produce 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), valuable aromatic compound used raw material production liquid crystal polymers paraben. C. glutamicum found higher tolerance 4-HBA toxicity previously reported hosts used production genetically engineered 4-HBA. obtain higher titers 4-HBA, employed stepwise overexpression seven target genes shikimate pathway C. glutamicum Specifically, multiple chromosomal integrations mutated aroG gene Escherichia coli, encoding 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, wild-type aroCKB C. glutamicum, encoding chorismate synthase, shikimate kinase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, effective increasing product titers. last step 4-HBA biosynthesis pathway recreated C. glutamicum expressing highly 4-HBA-resistant chorismate pyruvate-lyase (UbiC) intestinal bacterium Providencia rustigianii enhance yield 4-HBA, reduced formation by-products, 1,3-dihydroxyacetone pyruvate, deleting hdpA, gene coding haloacid dehalogenase superfamily phosphatase, pyk, gene coding pyruvate kinase, bacterial chromosome. maximum concentration 4-HBA produced resultant strain 36.6 g/liter, yield 41% (mol/mol) glucose incubation 24 h minimal medium aerobic growth-arrested bioprocess using jar fermentor. knowledge, highest concentration 4-HBA produced metabolically engineered microorganism ever reported.IMPORTANCE Since aromatic compound 4-HBA chemically produced petroleum-derived phenol long time, eco-friendly bioproduction 4-HBA biomass resources desired order address environmental issues. microbial chemical production, product toxicity often causes problems, confirmed wild-type C. glutamicum high tolerance target 4-HBA. growth-arrested bioprocess using microorganism successfully used production various compounds, biofuels, organic acids, amino acids. However, production method applied aromatic compounds date. study, screened novel final reaction enzyme possessing characteristics superior previously employed microbial 4-HBA production. demonstrated use highly 4-HBA-resistant UbiC intestinal bacterium P. rustigianii effective increasing 4-HBA production.
