 Enterocytes fasted rabbits make glucose exogenous fructose dihydroxyacetone rates 180 91 nmol/min/10(8) cells make glucose glycerol, aspartate, malate, lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate glutamine. Total activities phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase glucose 6-phosphatase isolated enterocytes 0.44, 0.60 1.90 mumol/min/10(8) cells, > = 95% carboxykinase activity intramitochondrial. Enterocytes contain marginal glycerol kinase (0.05 mumol/ min/10(8) cells) essentially pyruvate carboxylase activities. Enterocyte mitochondria synthesize citrate exogenous phosphoenolpyruvate acetylcarnitine rate 2.40 nmol/min/mg protein. Citrate formation highly dependent exogenous HCO3 inhibited strongly 3-mercaptopicolinate 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate. Citrate synthesis stimulated consistently GDP significantly GTP. Citrate production unaffected ADP ATP. Enterocytes fasted-refed rabbits contain activities 0.05, 0.12, 0.39 0.56 mumol/min/mg cytosolic protein ATP:citrate lyase, NADP:malate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase NADP:isocitrate dehydrogenase. Activities NADP:malate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase NADP:isocitrate dehydrogenase significantly higher enterocytes fasted-refed rabbits fasted rabbits. Mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase enterocytes vivo could convert glycolysis-derived phosphoenolpyruvate oxaloacetate that, acetyl CoA, could form citrate export support cytosolic lipogenesis activator acetyl CoA carboxylase, source carbon via ATP:citrate lyase NADPH via NADP:malate dehydrogenase NADP:isocitrate dehydrogenase.
