 Alkylating agents widely used chemotherapeutics treatment many cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, lung, breast ovarian cancer. Melphalan commonly used chemotherapeutic agent multiple myeloma. However, despite 70-80% initial response rate, virtually patients eventually relapse due emergence drug-resistant tumour cells. using global proteomic transcriptomic profiling melphalan sensitive resistant RPMI8226 cell lines followed functional assays, discovered changes cellular processes pathways previously associated melphalan resistance multiple myeloma cells, including metabolic switch conforming Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), elevated oxidative stress response mediated VEGF/IL8-signaling. addition, up-regulated aldo-keto reductase levels AKR1C family involved prostaglandin synthesis contribute resistant phenotype. Finally, selected metabolic oxidative stress response enzymes targeted inhibitors, several displayed selective cytotoxicity melphalan-resistant cells explored elucidate potential overcome melphalan resistance.
