 study, ghrelin investigated respect capacity proliferative effects molecular correlations oral tumor cells. presence molecular components ghrelin system, i.e., ghrelin receptors, analyzed could detected using real-time PCR immunohistochemistry. examine cellular effects caused ghrelin clarify downstream-regulatory mechanisms, two different oral tumor cell lines (BHY HN) used cell culture experiments. Stimulation either cell line ghrelin led significantly increased proliferation. Signal transduction occurred phosphorylation GSK-3beta nuclear translocation beta-catenin. effect could inhibited blocking protein kinase A. Glucose transporter1 (GLUT1), important factor delivering sufficient amounts glucose tumor cells high requirements carbohydrate (Warburg effect) up-regulated exogenous endogenous ghrelin. Silencing intracellular ghrelin concentrations using siRNA led significant decreased expression GLUT1 proliferation. conclusion, study describes role appetite-stimulating peptide hormone ghrelin oral cancer proliferation particular aspect glucose uptake: (1) tumor cells source ghrelin. (2) Ghrelin affects tumor cell proliferation autocrine and/or paracrine activity. (3) Ghrelin modulates GLUT1 expression thus indirectly enhances tumor cell proliferation. findings major relevance, glucose uptake assumed promising target cancer treatment.
