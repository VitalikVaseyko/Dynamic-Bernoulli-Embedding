 cytosolic form phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) plays regulatory role gluconeogenesis glyceroneogenesis. role mitochondrial isoform (PCK2) remains unclear. report partial purification kinetic functional characterization human PCK2. Kinetic properties enzyme similar cytosolic enzyme. PCK2 absolute requirement Mn(2+) ions activity; Mg(2+) ions reduce Km Mn(2+) 60 fold. specificity constant 100 fold larger oxaloacetate phosphoenolpyruvate suggesting oxaloacetate phosphorylation favored reaction vivo. enzyme possesses weak pyruvate kinase-like activity (kcat=2.7 s(-1)). overexpressed HEK293T cells enhances strongly glucose lipid production showing play, cytosolic isoenzyme, active role glyceroneogenesis gluconeogenesis.
