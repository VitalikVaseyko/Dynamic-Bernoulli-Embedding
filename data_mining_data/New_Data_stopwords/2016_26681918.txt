 Cancer remains lethal threat global lives. Development novel anticancer therapeutics still challenge scientists field biomedicine. cancer cells, metabolic features significantly different normal ones, hallmarks several malignancies. Recent studies brought atypical cellular metabolism, aerobic glycolysis Warburg effect, scientific limelight. Targeting altered metabolic pathways cancer cells presents promising therapeutic strategy. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), key enzymes pathway glucose metabolism, could inactivate pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) phosphorylating preserving substrates pyruvate, lactate alanine gluconeogenesis. Overexpression PDKs could block oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate satisfy high oxygen demand cancer cells, inhibition PDKs could upregulate activity PDC rectify balance demand supply oxygen, could lead cancer cell death. Thus, inhibitors targeting PDKs represent promising strategy cancer treatment acting glycolytic tumors showing minimal side effects oxidative healthy organs. review considers role PDKs regulator PDC catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate mitochondrion. concluded PDKs solid therapeutic targets. Inhibition PDKs could attractive therapeutic approach development anti-cancer drugs.
