 Heart failure major cause morbidity mortality world. Cardiac energy metabolism, specifically fatty acid glucose metabolism, altered heart failure implicated contributing factor impaired heart function observed heart failure patients. emerging evidence demonstrating correcting changes energy metabolism modulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism may effective treatment heart failure. Promising strategies include downregulation fatty acid oxidation increased coupling glycolysis glucose oxidation. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT1), fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) examples metabolic targets treatment heart failure. targeting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism promising strategy treat heart failure, studies needed confirm potential beneficial effect modulating metabolic targets approach treating heart failure. article part Special Issue entitled: Cardiomyocyte Biology: Cardiac Pathways Differentiation, Metabolism Contraction.
