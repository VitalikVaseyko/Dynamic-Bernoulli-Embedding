 function creatine kinase (CK) isozymes energy metabolism short-term regulation active ion transport gills euryhaline teleost Gillichthys mirabilis investigated. transfer fish regular seawater [36 parts/thousand (ppt)] hypersaline water (60 ppt), plasma osmolality increased significantly 361.0 +/- 5.2 434.2 +/- 20.6 mosmol/kgH2O within 2 h regulated 391.8 +/- 11.3 mosmol/kgH2O within 12 h. Although ATP concentration gill tissue remained unchanged, creatine concentration increased significantly 17.3 +/- 3.2 37.6 +/- 5.9 nmol/mg protein within 2 h salinity change. CK Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase-(Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase) activities unchanged 48 h transfer. Independent salinity, activities CK three seven times Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, creatine concentration gill least one order magnitude higher ATP concentration. occurrence muscle-type CK (CK-M), brain-type CK, mitochondrial CK demonstrated. CK-M predominant gills (59 +/- 7.1% total CK activity). Evidence direct functional coupling CK Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase obtained permeabilized gill cells, using CK inhibitor iodoacetamide, abolishes competitive channeling ADP external pyruvate kinase reaction endogeneous CK reaction coupled situ Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase assay. results show significance central regulatory role energy metabolism adaptive ionoregulation phosphocreatine-CK circuit situations high fluctuating energy demands euryhaline fishes.
