 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies indicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) related occurrence development many human diseases, cancer HELLP brachydactyly syndromes. However, studies LncRNA heart failure yet reported. Here, investigated cardiac lncRNA expression profiles myocardial-specific knockout pdk1 gene (KO) mouse model heart failure. METHODS: Cardiac samples obtained PDK1 KO WT mice postnatal (P) day 8 (P8) day 40 (P40), lncRNA expression profiles analyzed sequencing screening using Arraystar mouse lncRNA microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis lncRNAs confirmed identity genes. RESULTS: Comparisons KO control groups showed fold changes >1.5 expression levels 2,024 lncRNAs P8, fold changes >2 expression levels 4,095 lncRNAs detected P40. Nineteen lncRNAs validated RT-PCR. Bioinformatic pathway analyses indicated mkk7, sense overlap lncRNA, may involved pathological processes heart failure MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: data reveal differentially expressed lncRNA mice myocardial-specific deletion pdk1 gene, may provide new insights mechanism heart failure PDK1 knockout mice.
