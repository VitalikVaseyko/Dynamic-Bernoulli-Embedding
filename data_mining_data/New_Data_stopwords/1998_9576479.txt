 ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels nucleotide-gated channels couple metabolic status cell membrane excitability regulate number cellular functions, including hormone secretion cardioprotection. Although intracellular ATP endogenous inhibitor K(ATP) channels ADP serves channel activator, still matter debate whether changes intracellular concentrations ATP, ADP, and/or ATP/ADP ratio could account transition ATP-liganded ADP-liganded channel state. Here, overview evidence role cellular phosphotransfer cascades regulation K(ATP) channels. microenvironment K(ATP) channel harbors several phosphotransfer enzymes, including adenylate, creatine, pyruvate kinases, well glycolytic enzymes able transfer phosphoryls ATP ADP absence major changes cytosolic levels adenine nucleotides. phosphotransfer reactions governed metabolic status cell, phosphotransfer rate closely correlates K(ATP) channel activity. Adenylate kinase catalysis accelerates transition ATP ADP, leading K(ATP) channel opening, phosphotransfers driven creatine pyruvate kinases promote ADP ATP transition channel closure. Thus, delivery removal adenine nucleotides channel site, phosphotransfer reactions could regulate ATP/ADP balance immediate vicinity channel thereby probability K(ATP) channel opening. way, phosphotransfer reactions could provide transduction mechanism coupling cellular metabolic signals K(ATP) channel-associated functions.
