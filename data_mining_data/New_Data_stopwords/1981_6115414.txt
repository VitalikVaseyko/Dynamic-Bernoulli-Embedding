 Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) dimeric enzyme molecular mass 132000 catalyses interconversion D-glucose-6-phosphate D-fructose-6-phosphate. crystal structure enzyme pig muscle determined nominal resolution 2.6 A. structure alpha/beta type. subunit consists two domains active site domain interface subunit interface (P.J. Shaw & H. Muirhead (1976), FEBS Lett. 65, 50-55). subunit contains 13 methionine residues cyanogen bromide cleavage produce 14 fragments, identified least partly purified. Sequence information given one-third molecule 5 cyanogen bromide fragments. One sequences includes modified lysine residue. Modification residue leads parallel loss enzymatic activity. tentative fit two peptides electron density map made. seems possible glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triose phosphate isomerase pyruvate kinase contain histidine glutamate residue active site.
