 allosteric fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli modified pyridoxal 5'-phosphate presence absence phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, MgADP MgATP. cases time-dependent inactivation observed, rate extent inactivation varied according conditions used. kinetic properties partially inactivated enzyme differently modified addition substrates effectors modification mixture, parameters mostly affected concerning fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Tryptic peptides obtained fully inactivated pyruvate kinase different conditions separated. conditions three main 6-pyridoxyllysine-containing peptides present, amounts showed significant differences presence fructose 1,6-bisphosphate MgADP. function labelled peptides evidence supporting physical existence different conformational states discussed. main conclusion concerns involvement one peptides binding allosteric effector fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
