 Several nutrient transporters impacting glutathione/redox cycle regulation cell proliferation identified cancer, render transporters potential prime targets cytotoxic anticancer therapy. One promising transporter system X(c)(-), also known xCT (SLC7a11), expressed various cancers including primary malignant brain tumors (gliomas). important biological feature transporters, particular xCT specific modulation tumor microenvironment leading growth advantage cancer. Thus, tumor microenvironment shaping xCT inhibition revealed far neglected hallmark gliomas, i.e. tumor-induced neurotoxicity impact development peritumoral brain swelling. review discusses available pharmacological tools tumor microenvironment normalization, context perifocal edema Warburg effect highlights implications metabolic normalization approach design new therapies.
