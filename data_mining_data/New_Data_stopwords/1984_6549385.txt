 Livers obtained two lines domestic broiler selected low (lean) high (fat) plasma very-low-density lipoprotein concentration three generations. fat line possessed significantly higher hepatic specific activities malate dehydrogenase (NADP), ATP citrate lyase fatty acid synthase, lower glucose bisphosphatase lean line. glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase phosphofructokinase, similar concentration fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. recently discovered metabolic regulator present somewhat higher concentrations previously reported rats mice. exhibited positive correlation phosphofructokinase activity (only data fat line shown), stimulated enzyme activity added crude preparations.
