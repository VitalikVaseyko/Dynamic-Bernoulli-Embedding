 Since original observation Warburg Effect cancer cells, 8 decades ago, major question aerobic glycolysis favored oxidative phosphorylation remained unresolved. understanding phenomenon may well key development effective cancer therapies. paper, use semi-empirical method throw light puzzle. show aerobic glycolysis fact energetically favorable oxidative phosphorylation concentrations peroxide (H2O2) critical threshold value. fundamental reason activation high engagement pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) response production reactive oxygen species (ROS) H2O2 mitochondria high concentration H2O2 (produced mitochondria sources). makes oxidative phosphorylation inefficient source energy since leads (despite high levels ATP production) concomitant high energy consumption order respond hazardous waste products resulting cellular processes associated metabolic pathway. also demonstrate high concentration H2O2 results increased glucose consumption, also increases lactate production case glycolysis.
