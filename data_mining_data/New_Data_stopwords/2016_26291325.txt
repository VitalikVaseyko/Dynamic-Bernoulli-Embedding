 INTRODUCTION: Metformin proposed adjuvant therapy cancer treatment ability limit cancer incidence negatively modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. vitro, addition inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, metformin also induce apoptosis. molecular mechanism underlying second effect still poorly characterized published data often contrasting. investigated nutrient availability modulate metformin-induced apoptosis three breast cancer cell lines. MATERIAL METHODS: MCF7, SKBR3 MDA-MB-231 cells plated MEM medium supplemented increasing glucose concentrations DMEM medium treated 10 mM metformin. Cell viability monitored Trypan Blue assay treatment effects Akt/mTOR pathway apoptosis analysed Western Blot. Moreover, determined level expression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), well-known glycolytic enzyme expressed cancer cells. RESULTS: results showed metformin induce apoptosis breast cancer cells cultured physiological glucose concentrations pro-apoptotic effect completely abolished cells grown high glucose/high amino acid medium. Induction apoptosis found dependent AMPK activation but, least partially, independent TORC1 inactivation. Finally, showed that, nutrient-poor conditions, metformin able modulate intracellular glycolytic equilibrium downregulating PKM2 expression mechanism mediated AMPK activation. CONCLUSION: demonstrated metformin induces breast cancer cell apoptosis PKM2 downregulation nutrient-poor conditions. glucose levels also amino acid concentration influence observed metformin inhibitory effect mTOR pathway well pro-apoptotic effect. data demonstrate reduction nutrient supply tumors increase metformin efficacy modulation PKM2 expression/activity could promising strategy boost metformin anti-cancer effect.
