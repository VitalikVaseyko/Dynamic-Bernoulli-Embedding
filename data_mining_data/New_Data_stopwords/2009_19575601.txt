 review analyzes evidence presented support role organs liver kidney release substantial amounts glucose mammalian blood circulation. evidence includes (a) identification gluconeogenic enzyme activities various organs, especially small intestine, (b) levels mRNA enzymes, (c) measurements gluconeogenic flux small intestine. latter would definite proof extrahepatic, extrarenal glucose production. critically evaluate radioactive stable isotopic techniques used measure intestinal gluconeogenesis. also simulate impact unavoidable measurement errors apparent rates intestinal gluconeogenesis. conclude far credible evidence support concept glucose produced intestine muscle.
