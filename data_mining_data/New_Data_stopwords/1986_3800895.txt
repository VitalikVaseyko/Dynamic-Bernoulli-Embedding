 used control analysis quantify distribution control gluconeogenic pathway liver cells starved rats. Lactate pyruvate used gluconeogenic substrates. flux control coefficients various enzymes gluconeogenic pathway calculated elasticity coefficients enzymes towards substrates products fluxes different branches pathway. elasticity coefficients either calculated gamma/Keq. ratios (where gamma mass-action ratio Keq. equilibrium constant) enzyme-kinetic data measured experimentally. concluded gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase play central role control gluconeogenesis. pyruvate kinase inactive, gluconeogenic flux lactate largely controlled pyruvate carboxylase. low elasticity coefficient pyruvate carboxylase towards product oxaloacetate minimizes control steps gluconeogenic pathway located pyruvate carboxylase. situation occurs maximal gluconeogenic flux required, i.e. presence glucagon. absence hormone, pyruvate kinase active, control gluconeogenesis distributed among many steps, including pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase also steps outside classic gluconeogenic pathway adenine-nucleotide translocator.
