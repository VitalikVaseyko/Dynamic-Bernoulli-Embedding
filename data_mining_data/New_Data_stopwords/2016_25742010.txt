 intrinsic oncotropism oncosuppressive activities rodent protoparvoviruses (PVs) opening new prospects cancer virotherapy. Virus propagation, cytolytic activity, spread tightly connected activation PDK1 signaling cascade, delays stress-induced cell death sustains functioning parvoviral protein NS1 PKC(eta)-driven modifications. reveal new PV-induced intracellular loop-back mechanism whereby PKCeta/Rdx phosphorylates mouse PDK1:S138 activates independently PI3-kinase signaling. corresponding human PDK1phosphoS135 appears hallmark highly aggressive brain tumors may contribute effective targeting human gliomas H-1PV. Strikingly, although H-1PV trigger PDK1 activation normal human cells, cells show enhanced viral DNA amplification NS1-induced death upon expression constitutively active PDK1 mimicking PDK1phosphoS135. modification thus appears marker human glioma malignant progression sensitivity H-1PV-induced tumor cell killing.
