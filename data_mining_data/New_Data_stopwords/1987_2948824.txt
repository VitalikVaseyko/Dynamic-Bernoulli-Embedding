 Analogues adenine nucleotides, containing additional chloromethyl-pyrimidone ring fused purine base, obtained treatment AMP, ADP ATP alpha-acetylenic ester, methyl 4-chlorobut-2-ynoate. compounds tested ability substitute natural substrates cofactors several enzymes. ADP analogue, pyruvate kinase showed significant increase Km value moderate decrease V, reverse observed hexokinase tested modified ATP. Adenylate kinase active ATP analogue AMP derivative. Myosin accepted ATP analogue substrate, irreversibly modified. Among dehydrogenases tested, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibited nucleotide analogue. structure--activity relationship nucleotide derivatives, represent largest dimensional deviation known natural nucleotides, discussed comparison earlier described dimensional probes enzyme-nucleotide binding sites.
