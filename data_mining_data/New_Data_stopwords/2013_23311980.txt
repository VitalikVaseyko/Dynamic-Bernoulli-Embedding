 BACKGROUND: enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, PEPCK, occurs guanosine-nucleotide-using form animals prokaryotes. study natural genetic variation Colias (Lepidoptera, Pieridae). PEPCK offers route, alternative pyruvate kinase, carbon skeletons move cytosolic glycolysis mitochondrial Krebs cycle reactions. RESULTS: PEPCK expressed cytosol mitochondrion, differently diverse animal clades. vertebrates independently Drosophila, compartment-specific paralogous genes occur. contrasting expression strategy, compartment-specific PEPCKs Colias silkmoth, Bombyx, differ first, 5', exons; alternatively spliced onto common series following exons. two Colias species distinct clades, PEPCK sequence highly variable nonsynonymous synonymous sites, mainly common exons. Three major amino acid polymorphisms, Gly 335 <--> Ser, Asp 503 <--> Glu, Ile 629 <--> Val occur species, first two cases similar frequency species. Homology-based structural modelling shows variants alter hydrogen bonding, salt bridging, van der Waals interactions amino acid side chains, locally one another's sites distant PEPCK's structure, thus may affect enzyme function. ask, using coalescent simulations, polymorphisms' cross-species similarities compatible neutral evolution genetic drift, find probability null hypothesis 0.001 </= P </= 0.006 differing scenarios. CONCLUSION: results make null hypothesis neutrality PEPCK polymorphisms quite unlikely, support alternative hypothesis maintained natural selection parallel two species. alternative justifiably tested via studies PEPCK genotypes' effects function, organismal performance, fitness. case emphasizes importance, evolutionary insight, studying gene-specific mechanisms affected natural genetic variation essential complement surveys variation.
