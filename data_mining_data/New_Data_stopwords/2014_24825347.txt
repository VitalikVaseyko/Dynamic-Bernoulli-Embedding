 Much mechanism Wnt signaling drives proliferation oncogenesis attributed regulation cell cycle. Here, show Wnt/beta-catenin signaling directs another hallmark tumorigenesis, namely Warburg metabolism. Using biochemical assays fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) probe metabolism vitro living tumors, observe interference Wnt signaling colon cancer cells reduces glycolytic metabolism results small, poorly perfused tumors. identify pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) important direct target within larger gene program metabolism. PDK1 inhibits pyruvate flux mitochondrial respiration rescue expression Wnt-inhibited cancer cells rescues glycolysis well vessel growth tumor microenvironment. Thus, identify important mechanism Wnt-driven Warburg metabolism directs use glucose cancer cell proliferation links vessel delivery oxygen nutrients.
