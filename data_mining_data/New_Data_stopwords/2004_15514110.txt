 Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 nutritionally versatile soil bacterium closely related representatives well-characterized Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas putida. Unlike bacteria, Acinetobacter ADP1 highly competent natural transformation affords extraordinary convenience genetic manipulation. circular chromosome Acinetobacter ADP1, presented here, encodes 3325 predicted coding sequences, 60% classified based sequence similarity documented proteins. close evolutionary proximity Acinetobacter Pseudomonas species, judged sequences 16S RNA genes highest level bidirectional best hits, contrasts extensive divergence GC content DNA (40 versus 62%). chromosomes also differ significantly size, Acinetobacter ADP1 chromosome <60% length Pseudomonas counterparts. Genome analysis Acinetobacter ADP1 revealed genes metabolic pathways involved utilization large variety compounds. Almost genes, orthologs scattered species, located five major 'islands catabolic diversity', apparent 'archipelago catabolic diversity', within one-quarter overall genome. Acinetobacter ADP1 displays many features aerobic soil bacteria metabolism oriented toward degradation organic compounds found natural habitat. distinguishing feature genome absence gene corresponding pyruvate kinase, enzyme generally catalyzes terminal step conversion carbohydrates pyruvate respiration citric acid cycle. finding supports view cycle centrally geared catabolic capabilities exceptionally versatile organism.
