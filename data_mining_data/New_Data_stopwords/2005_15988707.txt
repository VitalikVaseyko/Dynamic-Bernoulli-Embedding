 Dietary fatty acids regulate abundance activity various proteins involved regulation fat oxidation functioning regulators gene transcription. determine whether transcription key lipid metabolic proteins necessary fat metabolism within human skeletal muscle regulated acute elevations circulating free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations, 7 healthy men underwent 3 randomized resting infusions Intralipid (20%) heparin sodium, saline heparin sodium, saline 5 hours. infusions significantly elevated plasma FFA concentrations 15-fold (to 1.67 +/- 0.13 mmol/L) Intralipid infusion trial, modest elevations observed saline heparin sodium saline alone infusion groups (0.67 +/- 0.09 0.49 +/- 0.087 mmol/L, P < .01 vs Intralipid infusion). Analysis messenger RNA (mRNA) concentration demonstrated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) mRNA, key negative regulator glucose oxidation, increased trials 24-fold response Intralipid infusion, 15-fold saline heparin infusion, 9-fold saline alone. PDK4 increases significantly different 3 trials. mRNA concentration major uncoupling protein within skeletal muscle, uncoupling protein 3, elevated parallel increased plasma FFA similar ( approximately 2-fold) increases evident trials. Additional genes involved lipid transport (fatty acid translocase/CD36), oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I), metabolism (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate -acyltransferase 1, hormone-sensitive lipase, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha) altered increased circulating FFA concentrations. present data demonstrate genes analyzed encode proteins key regulators lipid homeostasis within skeletal muscle, PDK4 gene uniquely sensitive increasing FFA concentrations increased plasma FFA achieved intravenous lipid infusion.
