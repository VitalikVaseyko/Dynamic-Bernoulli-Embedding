 Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) members steroid hormone/retinoic acid receptor superfamily, regulate homeostasis, development, differentiation. transcriptional activity modulated thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). present study evaluated effect availability cytoplasmic T3 modulation transcriptional responses TRs. human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 monkey COS-1 cells, cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein monomer tetrameric pyruvate kinase, subtype M2, bind T3. vivo monomer-tetramer interconversion regulated glucose via fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. physiological T3 concentration, lowering glucose concentration led increase cellular concentration cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein. using transient transfection system, concomitant reduction transcriptional activity human beta 1 thyroid hormone receptor detected cell lines. absence glucose, transcriptional activity human beta 1 thyroid hormone receptor JEG-3 COS-1 cells reduced 65-75% 90-95%, respectively. However, glucose effect basal transcriptional activity. findings demonstrate important prenuclear step modulation gene regulating activity TRs.
