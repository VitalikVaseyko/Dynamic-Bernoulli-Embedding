 purpose study identify epithelial stromal proteins exhibit up- down-regulation keratoconus (KC) vs. normal human corneas. previous proteomic studies utilized whole human corneas epithelium alone, thereby diluted specificity proteome tissue, selectively analyzed epithelium stromal proteins. Individual preparations epithelial stromal proteins KC age-matched normal corneas analyzed two independent methods, i.e., shotgun proteomic using Nano-Electrospray Ionization Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry [Nano-ESI-LC-MS (MS)(2)] two-dimensional-difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled mass spectrometric methods. label-free Nano-ESI-LC-MS (MS)(2) method identified 104 epithelial 44 stromal proteins normal KC corneas, also quantified relative changes levels selected proteins, tissues using spectral counts proteomic dataset. Relative normal corneal epithelial proteins, six KC epithelial proteins (lamin-A/C, keratin type cytoskeletal 14, tubulin beta chain, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, keratin type cytoskeletal 16 protein S100-A4) exhibited up-regulation five proteins (transketolase, pyruvate kinase, 14-3-3 sigma isoform, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, NADPH dehydrogenase (quinone) 1) showed down-regulation. similar relative analysis showed three KC stromal proteins (decorin, vimentin keratocan) up-regulated five stromal proteins (TGF-betaig h3 (Bigh3), serotransferrin, MAM domain-containing protein 2 isoforms 2C2A collagen alpha-2[VI] chain) down-regulated. 2D-DIGE-mass spectrometry followed Decyder software analysis showed relative normal corneas, KC corneal epithelium exhibited up-regulation four proteins (serum albumin, keratin 5, L-lactate dehydrogenase annexin A8) down-regulation four proteins (FTH1 [Ferritin heavy chain protein 1], calpain small subunit 1, heat shock protein beta 1 annexin A2). similar relative analysis stroma method also showed up-regulation aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1), keratin 12, apolipoprotein A-IV precursor, haptoglobin precursor, prolipoprotein lipoprotein Gln KC corneas. Together, results suggested Nano-ESI-LC-MS(MS)(2) method superior 2D-DIGE method identified greater number proteins altered levels KC corneas. Further, epithelial stromal structural proteins KC corneas exhibited altered levels compared normal corneas, suggesting affected due structural remodeling KC development progression. Additionally, several epithelial stromal enzymes exhibited up- down-regulation KC corneas relative normal corneas, two layers KC corneas metabolic stress adjust remodeling.
