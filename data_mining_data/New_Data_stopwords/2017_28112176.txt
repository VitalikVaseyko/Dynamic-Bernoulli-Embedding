 BX-795 inhibitor 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), also potent inhibitor IKK-related kinase, TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) IKKvarepsilon. study attempted elucidate molecular mechanism(s) underlying inhibition BX-795 Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. HEC-1-A Vero cells treated BX-795 infected HSV-1 HSV-2 different periods. BX-795 (3.125-25 mumol/L) dose-dependently suppressed HSV-2 replication, displayed low cytotoxicity host cells. BX-795 treatment dose-dependently suppressed expression two HSV immediate-early (IE) genes (ICP0 ICP27) late gene (gD) 12 h postinfection. HSV-2 infection resulted activation PI3K Akt host cells, BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation activation. However, blockage PI3K/Akt/mTOR LY294002 rapamycin affect HSV-2 replication. HSV-2 infection increased phosphorylation JNK p38, reduced ERK phosphorylation 8 h postinfection host cells; BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced activation JNK p38 MAP kinase well phosphorylation c-Jun ATF-2, downstream targets JNK p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) dose-dependently inhibited viral replication host cells, whereas PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) effective. Moreover, BX-795 blocked PMA-stimulated c-Jun activation well HSV-2-mediated c-Jun nuclear translocation. BX-795 dose-dependently inhibited HSV-2, PMA, TNF-alpha-stimulated AP-1 activation, HSV-induced NF-kappaB activation. Overexpression p38/JNK attenuated inhibitory effect BX-795 HSV replication. BX-795 completely blocked HSV-2-induced MKK4 phosphorylation, suggesting BX-795 acting upstream JNK p38 MAP kinase. conclusion, study identifies anti-HSV activity BX-795 targeting JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways host cells.
