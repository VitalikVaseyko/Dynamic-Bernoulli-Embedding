 PURPOSE: purpose study observe effects metformin human esophageal cancer cell investigate possible mechanisms. MATERIALS METHODS: Cell viability detected using Cell Counting Kit-8, cell cycle apoptosis assessed flow cytometry western blot used measure expression related proteins. RNAi used knockout pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2). Eca109 tumor model established evaluate antitumor effect vivo. Immunohistochemistry determined based expression PKM2 Bim tumor tissues. Tunnel used assess tumor cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Esophageal cancer cells viability reduced metformin treatment. cell cycle arrested G0/G1 phase, apoptosis induced, caspase 3 activated, caspase 9 downregulated, pro-apoptotic protein Bim increased. study revealed metformin could suppress expression insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor downstream proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT/PKB), phosphorylation AKT (pAKT), mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR), p70S6K, PKM2. Insulin-like growth factor 1 partly reversed metfromin-induced apoptosis attenuated repression effect metfomin PI3K, pAKT, PKM2. Knockout PKM2 resulted activation caspase 3, down-regulation caspase 9, increased expression Bim. Eca109 xenograft model, metformin significantly reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, found metformin treatment increased rate apoptosis, down-regulation PKM2, up-regulation Bim tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: Metformin restrained esophageal cancer cell proliferation partly suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
