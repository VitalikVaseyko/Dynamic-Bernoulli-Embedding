 Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P(2)) potent allosteric activator liver 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase enzyme, crucial glycolysis. present skeletal muscle importance controversial regulator muscle glycolysis. study aims determine role Fru-2,6-P(2) control muscle glycolysis contraction. Muscle contraction produced chronic low-frequency stimulation rabbit tibialis anterior 24 h, followed rest period 48 h. determine muscle glycolysis adaptation, applied short functional electrostimulation test using system low-frequency stimulation 1, 3, 10 s. variation concentration lactate pyruvate used calculate flux along glycolysis pathway Fru-1,6-P(2)/Fru-6-P ratio permitted analyze 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activation. Fru-2,6-P(2) levels increased 24 h stimulation remained elevated rest period, metabolite kept changes produced chronic low-frequency stimulation rest. short functional electrostimulation test, glycolytic pathway stimulated rested muscle active control muscle, coincided higher kinase activity 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) enzyme. Furthermore, found decrease muscle, liver, ubiquitous PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoform expression increase heart isoform expression. first time, demonstrate persistent increase Fru-2,6-P(2) produced change PFK-2/FBPase-2 isoform expression may play important role regulation muscle glycolysis first moments exercise.
