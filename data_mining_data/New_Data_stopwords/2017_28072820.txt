 p-Cymene aromatic terpene present diverse plant species. aims study study p-cymene metabolism model aromatic-degrading bacterium Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, response p-cymene. catabolic p-cymene (cym) p-cumate (cmt) genes clustered LB400 major chromosome. B. xenovorans LB400 able grow p-cymene well p-cumate sole carbon energy sources. LB400 growth attained higher cell concentration stationary phase p-cumate p-cymene. transcription key cymAb cmtAb genes, p-cumate dioxygenase activity observed LB400 cells grown p-cymene p-cumate, glucose-grown cells. Diverse changes LB400 proteome observed p-cymene-grown cells compared glucose-grown cells. increase molecular chaperones DnaK, GroEL ClpB, organic hydroperoxide resistance protein Ohr, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC copper oxidase CopA growth p-cymene strongly suggests exposure p-cymene constitutes stress condition strain LB400. Diverse proteins energy metabolism enolase, pyruvate kinase, aconitase AcnA, succinyl-CoA synthetase beta subunit ATP synthase beta subunit induced p-cymene. Electron microscopy showed p-cymene-grown cells exhibited fuzzy outer inner membranes increased periplasm. p-Cymene induced diverse membrane transport proteins including p-cymene transporter CymD. Biofilm formation reduced growth p-cymene strain LB400 compared glucose-grown cells may associated decrease diguanylate cyclase protein levels. Overall, results indicate active p-cymene p-cumate catabolic pathways B. xenovorans LB400. addition, study showed p-cymene activated stress response strain LB400 reduced biofilm formation.
