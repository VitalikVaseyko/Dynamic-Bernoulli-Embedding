 degree coupling oxidative phopshorylation q determined isolated perfused livers livers vivo fed fasted rats. determination q based simple nonequilibrium-thermodynamic representation major reactions cytosolic adenine nucleotides, made use measured cytosolic concentrations adenine nucleotides, phosphate, lactate/pyruvate ratios extracted livers. deviations measured values theoretically predicted ones different mass action ratios adenylate kinase reaction showed basic assumptions model, including linearity flows thermodynamic forces, fulfilled intact liver within experimental error. degree coupling higher livers fed rats livers fasted rats. particular, determined values q close theoretical degrees coupling qecp qecf allow maximization output power output flow oxidative phosphorylation fed fasted states, respectively, optimal efficiency minimal energy costs. finding indicates conductance matching load phosphorylation fulfilled vivo. Moreover, found fatty acids lower degree coupling concentration-dependent manner. suggested livers fasted state q decreased due elevated fatty-acid levels. Thus fatty acids could act metabolic regulators degree coupling, enabling cell optimize efficiency oxidative phosphorylation different metabolic regimes.
