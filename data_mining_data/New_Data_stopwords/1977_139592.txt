 Blood 10 normal healthy adults cord blood 8 healthy full term infants infiltrated mixture sulfoethylethycellulose-Sephadex G 25 order eliminate platelets leukocytes. erythrocytes fractionated young old cells centrifugation microhematocrit tubes. enzyme activity immunologic reactivity glucose phosphate isomerase (EC.5.3.1.9), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC.2.7.2.3), pyruvate kinase (ec.2.7.1.40), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC. 1.1.1.49), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC.1.1.1.44) measured every fraction. previously reported, enzyme activities far higher cord blood adult blood red cells; nevertheless, age-related loss enzyme activity similar cord adult blood. decrease enzyme activity glucose phosphate isomerase phosphoglycerate kinase old cells singly associated lowered concentration enzyme-related antigen; contrast, age-related decrease enzyme activity pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase associated lowered concentration enzyme-related antigen lowered "molecular specific activity" (i.e., lowered ratio enzyme activity enzyme-related antigen concentration). phenomenon especially marked pyruvate kinase, molecular specific activity old cells 68% young cells. Phosphofructokinase lower enzyme activity cord blood erythrocytes adult blood erythrocytes; difference especially important old cells infants phosphofructokinase activity 53% old cells adults. Phosphofructokinase old cells full term infants unfractionated cells two premature infants (21 32 weeks gestation) less neutralized anti-muscle phosphofructokinase serum inhibited ATP enzyme adult blood erythrocytes.
