 specific activity several red cell enzymes studied pair monozygotic twins, one presented acute myeloblastic leukemia. intrapair variation twins compared series nine normal twins, significant decrease phosphoglycerate kinase, diphosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities increase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity demonstrable leukemic twin. heat stability leukemic proband's pyruvate kinase pH 8.0 56 degrees C less normal twin, suggesting acquired qualitative disorder.
