 Dichloroacetate (DCA) activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) inhibiting PDH kinase. Neutralized DCA (100 mg/kg) saline intravenously administered 20 25-day-old rats (50-75g). Fifteen minutes later mixture [6-14C]glucose [3H]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) administered intravenously animals sacrificed microwave irradiation (2450 MHz, 8.0 kW, 0.6-0.8 sec) 2 5 min. Brain regional rates glucose use metabolite levels determined. DCA-treated rats increased rates glucose use regions studied (cortex, thalamus, striatum, brain stem), average increase 41%. Lactate levels lower regions, average 35%. significant changes levels ATP, creatine phosphate, glycogen brain region. Blood levels lactate differ significantly DCA- saline-treated groups. Blood glucose levels higher DCA group. rats sacrificed freeze-blowing, DCA treatment caused lower brain levels lactate pyruvate. results cannot explained systemic effect DCA. Rather, appears immature rat, DCA treatment results activation brain PDH, increased metabolism brain pyruvate lactate, resulting increase brain glycolytic rate.
