 Alveolar macrophages (AM) peritoneal macrophages (PM) originate common precursor cells, function different O2 environments. present studies, impact different O2 tensions cell metabolism quantitatively determined, enzymatic basis differences established, mechanism regulates enzymatic differences demonstrated. O2 consumption lactate production compared rabbit PM air nitrogen. air, demonstrate significantly greater O2 utilization. nitrogen, (where glycolysis major source energy provision) lactate production two- threefold greater PM. comparison several enzymes energy metabolism PM indicate one basis differences cell energetics difference activity key enzymes oxidative phosphorlyative glycolytic sequences. Exposure cultivated hypoxic conditions results changes activity enzymes closely resembles PM. key enzyme oxidative phosphorylation (cytochrome oxidase) shows decreased activity reaches values similar found PM. key enzyme glycolysis (pyruvate kinase) shows increased activity values resembling found PM. alterations enzyme pattern occur isolated cell systems, suggesting molecular O2 modifies intrinsic cellular regulation enzymes energy metabolism. Alterations O2 tension may lead alterations rate biosynthesis (or) rate biodegradation key enzymes involved oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis. turn, alteration enzyme patterns leads suitable bioenergetic pattern function O2 availability.
