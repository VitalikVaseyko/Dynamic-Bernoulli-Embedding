 BACKGROUND: present study aimed investigate expression CYP27A1, CYP7B1, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) breast carcinoma tissue evaluate prognostic value progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS). METHODS: total 20 patients treated surgery primary breast carcinoma enrolled: 10 cases diagnosed recurrent metastasis (A), along corresponding metastases specimen (AM) 10 cases evidence recurrence metastasis (B). Baseline characteristics patients including age, lymph node metastasis, molecular subtypes, tumor staging size, pathological classification collected. Immunohistochemistry performed detect protein expression tumor specimens. RESULTS: Elevated G6PD protein levels noted group compared group B (both P < 0.05), PKM2 expression also higher group compared group (P = 0.019), similar group B (P > 0.05). association clinicopathological parameters two proteins expression observed. G6PD protein expression strongly associated PFS breast carcinoma patients (P = 0.021) OS. According Kaplan-Meier analysis, mean PFS time patients G6PD-negative G6PD-positive expression tumor 71.36 +/- 6.53 32.25 +/- 5.67 months, respectively (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: G6PD protein could served potential prognostic biomarker primary breast carcinoma, overexpression G6PD protein predicted high risk recurrent metastasis poor PFS follow-up.
