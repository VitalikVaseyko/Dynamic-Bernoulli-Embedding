 Recent discovery magnesium isotope effect rate enzymatic synthesis adenosine triphosphate (ATP) offers new insight mechanochemistry enzymes molecular machines. activity phosphorylating enzymes (ATP-synthase, phosphocreatine, phosphoglycerate kinases) Mg(2+) ion magnetic isotopic nucleus 25Mg found 2-3 times higher enzymes Mg(2+) ion spinless, nonmagnetic isotopic nuclei 24Mg 26Mg. isotope effect demonstrates unambiguously ATP synthesis spin-dependent ion-radical process. reaction schemes, suggested explain effect, imply reversible electron transfer terminal phosphate anion ADP Mg(2+) ion first step, generating ion-radical pair singlet triplet spin states. yields ATP along singlet triplet channels controlled hyperfine coupling unpaired electron 25Mg+ ion magnetic nucleus 25Mg. difference ATP yield enzymes 24Mg 26Mg; gives evidence reaction magnetic isotope effect (MIE) operates rather classical, mass-dependent one. Similar effects also found pyruvate kinase. Magnetic field dependence enzymatic phosphorylation agreement suggested ion-radical mechanism.
