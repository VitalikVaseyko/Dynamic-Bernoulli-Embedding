 Purpose Preclinical evidence suggests dichloroacetate (DCA) reverse Warburg effect inhibit growth cancer models. phase 1 study undertaken assess safety, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic (PK) profile oral DCA patients advanced solid tumors. Patients Methods Twenty-four patients advanced solid malignancies enrolled using standard 3 + 3 protocol starting dose 6.25 mg/kg twice daily (BID). Treatment 28 days cycles continued progression, toxicity, consent withdrawal. PK samples collected days 1 15 cycle 1, day 1 subsequent cycles. PET imaging ((18) F-FDG uptake) investigated potential biomarker response. Results Twenty-three evaluable patients treated DCA two doses: 6.25 mg/kg 12.5 mg/kg BID (median 2 cycles each). DLTs occurred 6.25 mg/kg BID cohort dose escalated. Three seven patients DLTs (fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea) 12.5 mg/kg BID. Thirteen additional patients treated 6.25 mg/kg BID. toxicities grade 1-2 common fatigue, neuropathy nausea. responses observed eight patients stable disease. DCA PK profile cancer patients consistent previously published data. high variability PK values neuropathy among patients. Progressive increase DCA trough levels trend towards decreased (18) F-FDG uptake length DCA therapy observed. Conclusions RP2D oral DCA 6.25 mg/kg BID. Toxicities require careful monitoring future trials.
