 fulfill bioenergetic demands activation, cells perform aerobic glycolysis, process common highly proliferative cells glucose fermented lactate rather oxidized mitochondria. However, signaling events initiate aerobic glycolysis cells remain unclear. show cell activation rapidly induces glycolysis independent transcription, translation, CD28, Akt involving increased glucose uptake activity glycolytic enzymes. Rather, TCR signaling promotes activation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), inhibiting mitochondrial import pyruvate facilitating breakdown lactate. Inhibition PDHK1 reveals switch required acutely cytokine synthesis dispensable cytotoxicity. Functionally, cytokine synthesis modulated via lactate dehydrogenase, represses cytokine mRNA translation aerobic glycolysis disengaged. data provide mechanistic insight metabolic contribution effector cell function suggest cell function may finely tuned modulation glycolytic activity.
