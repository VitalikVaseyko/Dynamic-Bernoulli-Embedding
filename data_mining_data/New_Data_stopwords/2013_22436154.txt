 Foetal life malnutrition studied intensively number animal models. Results show especially foetal life protein malnutrition lead metabolic changes later life. might particular importance strict carnivores, example, cat mink (Neovison vison) higher protein requirement domestic mammals. study aimed investigate effects low protein provision foetal life male mink kits protein metabolism early post-weaning period rapid growth investigate whether foetal life protein deficiency affects response adequate deficient protein provision post weaning. Further, intended study whether changes gene expression key enzymes foetal hepatic tissue caused maternal protein deficiency manifested post-weaning. total 32 male mink kits born mothers fed either low-protein diet (LP), is, 14% metabolizable energy (ME) protein (foetal low - FL), n = 16, adequate-protein (AP) diet, is, 29% protein (foetal adequate - FA), n = 16) last 16.3 +/- 1.8 days pregnancy used. FL offspring lower birth weight lower relative abundance fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase) pyruvate kinase mRNA foetal hepatic tissue FA kits. mothers fed diet containing adequate protein weaning. weaning (7 weeks age), half kits foetal treatment group fed AP diet (32% protein; n = 8 FA 8 FL) half fed LP diet (18% protein; n = 8 FA 8 FL) 9.5 weeks age, yielding four treatment groups (i.e. FA-AP, FA-LP, FL-AP FL-LP). Low protein provision foetal life lowered protein oxidation post-weaning compared controls (P = 0.006), indicating metabolic flexibility better ability conserve protein. could not, however, supported changes liver mass foetal life experience. lower relative abundance Fru-1,6-P2ase mRNA observed (P < 0.05), lower 9.5-week-old FL FA kits. concluded foetal life protein restriction leads changes post-weaning protein metabolism lower protein oxidation male mink kits.
