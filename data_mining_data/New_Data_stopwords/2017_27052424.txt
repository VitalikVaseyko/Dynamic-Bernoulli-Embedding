 aim present study evaluate effect beta-glucan acute hypoxia-induced oxidative stress changes energy metabolism determining ROS production, activities mRNA levels energy metabolism enzyme (PK, F-ATPase, SDH MDH), gene expression HIF-1alpha liver large yellow croaker. Fish injected beta-glucan dose 0 5 mg kg(-1) body weight 6, 4 2 days exposed 1.5 7.0 mg L(-1) 48 h. results showed beta-glucan enhanced survival rate reduced ROS lethal hypoxic stress, indicating beta-glucan could ameliorate hypoxia-induced oxidative stress. Obtained results also showed beta-glucan could up-regulate activities mRNA levels PK, demonstrating beta-glucan increased anaerobic glycolysis capacity. Furthermore, coordinated transcriptional regulation energy metabolism enzyme genes observed, suggesting HIF-1alpha required regulating genes. conclusion, beta-glucan could alleviate cute hypoxia-induced oxidative stress large yellow croker enhancing anaerobic glycolysis capacity, emphasizing central role transcription factor HIF-1alpha process.
