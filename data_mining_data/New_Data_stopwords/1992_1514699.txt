 common technique preparative labeling proteins radioisotopes experimental purposes utilizes 125I. isotope certain limitations, including emission gamma- X-irradiation, release gaseous 125I2 solutions Na 125I, potential concentration 125I thyroid glands. discovered means labeling proteins rapidly simply [35S]methionine. technique applicable wide variety proteins. Antibodies labeled technique remain functional.
