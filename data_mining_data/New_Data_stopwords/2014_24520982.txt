 Metabolic flexibility capacity system adjust fuel (primarily glucose fatty acids) oxidation based nutrient availability. ability alter substrate oxidation response nutritional state depends genetically influenced balance oxidation storage capacities. Competition fatty acids glucose oxidation occurs level pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC normally active tissues fed state, suppressing PDC activity pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase (PDK) crucial maintain energy homeostasis extreme nutritional conditions mammals. Conversely, inappropriate suppression PDC activity might promote development metabolic diseases. review summarizes PDKs' pivotal role control metabolic flexibility various nutrient conditions different tissues, emphasis best characterized PDK4. Understanding regulation PDC PDKs roles energy homeostasis could beneficial alleviate metabolic inflexibility provide possible therapies metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D).
