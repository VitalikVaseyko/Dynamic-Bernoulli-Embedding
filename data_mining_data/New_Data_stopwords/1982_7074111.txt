 Interaction rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) inhibitory activatory effectors analyzed terms Yagi-Ozawa equation. Straight-line plots obtained L-phenylalanine + L-alanine L-phenylalanine + L-phenylalanyl methyl ester (PheAlaOMe) indicated competition common sites. Parabolic plots 2-phosphoglycerate L-phenylalanine PheAlaOMe suggested lack competition compounds. Biphasic concave plots obtained 2-phosphoglycerate L-1-amino-2-phenylethyl phosphonic acid (PnPhe), mixtures inhibitory (L-phenylalanine, PheAlaOMe) activatory (PnPhe, L-alanine L-1-aminoethyl phosphonic acid (PnAla)) amino acid derivatives. latter non-classical Yagi-Ozawa plots interpreted terms existence distinct regulatory sites inhibitory activatory ligands.
