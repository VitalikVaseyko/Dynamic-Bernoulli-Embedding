 Polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters (PHEs) over-accumulate internodes rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, Fukei 71 (F71). accumulation accompanied over-expression phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL). study, show one member 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) family expresses close correlation PAL. Furthermore, substrate availability DAHPS promoted down-regulating expression plastidic pyruvate kinase (PKp), competitor DAHPS. Since over-production PHEs caused D50 gene disruption, results suggest specific enzymes phenylpropanoid shikimate pathways coordinately up-regulated. addition, results indicate carbon-flow shikimate pathway modified synthesis PHEs, probably controlled D50.
