 Sepsis characterized dysregulated systemic inflammation release early (e.g., IL-1beta) late (e.g., HMGB1) proinflammatory mediators macrophages. Plumbagin, medicinal plant-derived naphthoquinone, reported exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, underling mechanisms remains unclear. Here, demonstrated plumbagin inhibits inflammatory response interfering immunometabolism pathway activated macrophages. Remarkably, plumbagin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced aerobic glycolysis downregulating expression pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), protein kinase responsible final rate-limiting reaction step glycolytic pathway. Moreover, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4)-mediated oxidative stress required LPS-induced PKM2 expression, pharmacologic genetic inhibition NOX4 plumbagin RNA interference limited LPS-induced PKM2 expression, lactate production, subsequent proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1beta HMGB1) release macrophages. Finally, plumbagin protected mice lethal endotoxemia polymicrobial sepsis induced cecal ligation puncture. findings identify new approach inhibiting NOX4/PKM2-dependent immunometabolism pathway treatment sepsis inflammatory diseases.
