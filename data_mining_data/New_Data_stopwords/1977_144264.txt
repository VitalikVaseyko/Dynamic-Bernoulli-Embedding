 Cord blood erythrocytes nine term infants separated density gradient centrifugation cohorts intact cells progressively increasing density compared red cells treated similar manner four healthy adults. Pyruvate kinase (PK), age-dependent enzyme, progressively decreased activity lightest heaviest fractions, neonatal adult red cells, indicating red cells newborn infants exhibit relationship red cell age density previously demonstrated red cells adults. rate decline red cell PK activity essentially neonates adults, whereas phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity cord erythrocytes decreased significantly faster rate compared adults. data suggest PFK accelerated rate vivo decay neonatal red cells unstable enzyme newborn.
