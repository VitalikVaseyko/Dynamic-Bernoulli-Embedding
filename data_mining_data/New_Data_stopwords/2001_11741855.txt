 intracellular carbon flux distribution wild-type pyruvate kinase-deficient Escherichia coli estimated using biosynthetically directed fractional 13C labeling experiments [U-13C6]glucose glucose- ammonia-limited chemostats, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy cellular amino acids, comprehensive isotopomer model. general response disruption pyruvate kinase isoenzymes E. coli local flux rerouting via combined reactions phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase malic enzyme. Responses pentose phosphate pathway tricarboxylic acid cycle strongly dependent environmental conditions. addition, high futile cycling activity via gluconeogenic PEP carboxykinase identified low dilution rate glucose-limited chemostat culture pyruvate kinase-deficient E. coli, turnover comparable specific glucose uptake rate. Furthermore, flux analysis mutant cultures indicates glucose uptake E. coli catalyzed exclusively phosphotransferase system glucose-limited cultures low dilution rate. Reliability flux estimates thus obtained verified statistical error analysis comparison intracellular carbon flux ratios independently calculated NMR data metabolic flux ratio analysis.
