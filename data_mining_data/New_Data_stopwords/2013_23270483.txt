 efforts characterize regulatory properties human liver pyruvate kinase (L-PYK), noted affinity protein phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) becomes reduced several days cell lysis. 1.8 crystallographic structure L-PYK S12D mimic phosphorylation indicates Cys436 oxidized, first potential insight explaining effect "aging". Interestingly, oxidation sulfenic acid despite crystal growth time period 2 weeks. Mutagenesis confirms side chain residue 436 energetically coupled PEP binding. Mass spectrometry confirms oxidation present solution artifact caused X-ray exposure. Exposure L-PYK mutations H(2)O(2) also confirms PEP affinity sensitive nature side chain position 436. 1.95 structure C436M mutant L-PYK, mutation position 436 shown strengthen PEP affinity, revealed methionine substitution results ordering several N-terminal residues ordered previous structures. result allowed speculation oxidation Cys436 phosphorylation N-terminus Ser12 may function similar mechanism, namely interruption activating interaction nonphosphorylated N-terminus nonoxidized main body protein. Mutant cycles used provide evidence mutations Cys436 energetically synergistic N-terminal modifications, result consistent phosphorylation N-terminus oxidation Cys436 functioning mechanisms common features. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis used confirm newly ordered N-terminal residues important regulation enzyme function N-terminus enzyme (i.e., artifact caused introduced methionine substitution) define residues N-terminus energetically coupled PEP affinity. Collectively, studies indicate energetic coupling (and potentially mechanistic similarities) oxidation Cys436 phosphorylation Ser12 N-terminus L-PYK.
