 Rat hepatocytes cultured modified HI-WO/BA medium 13 days, combined effect dexamethasone, 10(-7) M, insulin, 10(-8) M, glucagon, 10(-9) DNA-content, activity several enzymes, secretion albumin rate ethanol oxidation investigated. effect ethanol parameters also studied. parameters measured declined time hormone-free cultures. hormone-supplemented cultures, DNA-content, activity glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase secretion albumin maintained reasonable levels throughout 13 days, whereas activity alcohol dehydrogenase rate ethanol oxidation fell significantly, although less hormone-free cultures. Addition 50 mM ethanol hormone-supplemented culture medium caused ca. 20% fall activity glucokinase pyruvate kinase 20% increase alcohol dehydrogenase activity. effect ethanol observed activity hexokinase lactate dehydrogenase secretion albumin.
