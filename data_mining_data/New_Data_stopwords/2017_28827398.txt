 performed integrative network analyses identify targets used effectively treating liver diseases minimal side effects. first generated co-expression networks (CNs) 46 human tissues liver cancer explore functional relationships genes examined overlap functional physical interactions. Since increased de novo lipogenesis characteristic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), investigated liver-specific genes co-expressed fatty acid synthase (FASN). CN analyses predicted inhibition liver-specific genes decreases FASN expression. Experiments human cancer cell lines, mouse liver samples, primary human hepatocytes validated predictions demonstrating functional relationships liver genes, showing inhibition decreases cell growth liver fat content. conclusion, identified liver-specific genes linked NAFLD pathogenesis, pyruvate kinase liver red blood cell (PKLR), HCC pathogenesis, PKLR, patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), potential targets drug development.
