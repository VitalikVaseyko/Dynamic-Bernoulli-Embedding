 Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) activity correlated haematological parameters. statistically significant negative correlation obtained activity PK total haemoglobin, total red blood cell count, packed cell volume, positive correlation white blood cell count, reticulocyte count, red cell indices anaemic patients. non-anaemic patients correlation PK haematological parameters similar except reticulocytes, slightly negative, statistically non-significant correlation obtained. suggested patients anaemias, infections, leucocytosis, elevation PK level significantly mask PK deficiency due associated PK deficient variants. therefore essential eliminate white cells conducting PK assays, make corrections reticulocytes.
