 80 years ago, Warburg discovered cancer cells generate ATP glycolytic pathway, even presence oxygen. finding phenomenon, termed "Warburg effect," stimulated much research tumorigenesis, explanations forthcoming explain observation. Recently, advanced developments molecular biology high-throughput molecular analyses revealed many signaling pathways altered gene mutations regulate cell metabolism cancer. Furthermore, mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 2 shown elevate 2-hydroxyglutarate, led changes alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme activity, resulting increased risk malignant tumors. Although findings led renewed interest cancer metabolism, knowledge specifics tumor metabolism still fragmented. paper reviews recent findings related key transcription factors enzymes play important role regulation cancer metabolism.
