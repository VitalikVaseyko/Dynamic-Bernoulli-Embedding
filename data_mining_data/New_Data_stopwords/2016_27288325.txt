 study points analysis morphological features suggestive somatic mutations, mostly BRAFV600E mutation, cytological samples thyroid carcinomas. According literature, application ancillary techniques cytology comes handy challenging aid ruling malignant outcome conventional liquid-based cytological preparations. However, evaluation somatic mutations, including BRAFV600E, usually performed DNA techniques, may limitations worldwide diffusion. perspective, authors emphasized morphological search BRAFV600E mutations harbored papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) characterized specific architectural cellular findings (i.e. eosinophilic cells defined 'plump cells' sickle-shaped nuclei). Hence, detection eosinophilic cytoplasm mutated PTC cells seems suggest possible involvement 'Warburg effect' pioneering ability cancer cells convert glucose lactic acid. recent yields immunohistochemical expression monocarboxylate transporters mutated PTCs may suggest accumulation lactate plump cells. Equally importantly, detection morphological findings using fine-needle aspiration cytology may helpful triaging thyroid lesions limiting costs. Additionally, may lead stratification malignant risk personalized management cases multifocal lesions.
