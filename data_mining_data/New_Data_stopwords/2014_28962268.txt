 Imidacloprid (IC) systemic insecticide related tobacco toxin nicotine. IC toxic substance frequently used combat insects, rodents plants pests creatures pose problems agriculture. We, therefore, planned study assess risk factors, biochemical histological alterations associated hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity. Forty-eight adult male albino mice divided four groups 12 animals each. animals given standard synthetic pellet diet. One group served control, three served experimental groups. Decrease body weight high dose group observed 15 mg/kg/day, mortality occurred treatment period. High dose imidacloprid caused significant elevation serum clinical chemistry parameters, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvate kinase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) total bilirubin (TBIL). Histology liver kidney indicates hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity high dose imidacloprid. Based morphological, biochemical histopathological analysis, evident imidacloprid induced toxicological effects 15 mg/kg/day mice. results present study demonstrate IC significant effects body weight, liver functions kidney (p < 0.05) dose 15 mg/kg body weight. IC treatment 5 10 mg/kg/day may considered observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) mice. concluded IC cause hepatotoxicity nephrotoxicity dose much lower LD50 (131 mg/kg body weight) mice.
