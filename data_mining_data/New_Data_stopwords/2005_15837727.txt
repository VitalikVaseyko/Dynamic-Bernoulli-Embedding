 2-[(18)F]Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) assesses fundamental property neoplasia, Warburg effect. molecular imaging technique offers complementary approach anatomic imaging sensitive specific certain cancers. FDG-PET widely applied oncology primarily staging restaging tool guide patient care. However, accurately detects recurrent residual disease, FDG-PET also significant potential assessing therapy response. regard, improve patient management identifying responders early, tumor size reduced; nonresponders could discontinue futile therapy. Moreover, reduction FDG-PET signal within days weeks initiating therapy (e.g., lymphoma, non-small cell lung, esophageal cancer) significantly correlates prolonged survival clinical end points used drug approvals. findings suggest FDG-PET could facilitate drug development early surrogate clinical benefit. article reviews scientific basis FDG-PET development application valuable oncology imaging tool. potential facilitate drug development seven oncologic settings (lung, lymphoma, breast, prostate, sarcoma, colorectal, ovary) addressed. Recommendations include initial validation approved therapies, retrospective analyses define magnitude change indicative response, prospective validation surrogate clinical benefit, application phase II/III trial end point accelerate evaluation approval novel regimens therapies.
