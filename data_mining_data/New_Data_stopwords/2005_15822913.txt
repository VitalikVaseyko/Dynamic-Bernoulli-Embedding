 total nine potential markers endometrial cancer (EmCa) discovered identified endometrial tissue homogenates using combination differentially labeled tags, iTRAQ cICAT, multidimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. tissues snap frozen liquid nitrogen within 15-20 min devitalization. Samples proteomic analysis treated protease inhibitors processing. Marker proteins overexpressed EmCa chaperonin 10, pyruvate kinase M1 M2 isozyme, calgizzarin, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0, macrophage migratory inhibitory factor, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor precursor; underexpressed alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor, creatine kinase B, transgelin. chaperonin 10 result confirms earlier observation overexpression EmCa tissues using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, verified Western analysis immunohistochemistry [Yang, E. C. C. et al. J. Proteome Res. 2004, 3, 636-643]. Pyruvate kinase observed overexpressed using iTRAQ cICAT labeling. nine markers found associated various forms cancer. panel plus markers may confer sufficient selectivity diagnosing screening EmCa. use cICAT led identification higher proportion lower-abundance signaling proteins; conversely, iTRAQ resulted higher percentage abundant ribosomal proteins transcription factors.
