 Cytosolic pyruvate kinase endosperm germinating castor beans (Ricinus communis L.; cv Hale) purified 3100-fold apparent homogeneity final specific activity 203 micromole pyruvate produced/minute per milligram protein. Purification steps included: heat treatment, polyethylene glycol fractionation, Q-Sepharose, ADP-agarose, Mono-Q Phenyl Superose chromatography. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis final sample resulted single protein staining band co-migrated pyruvate kinase activity. Two protein staining bands 57 56 kilodaltons observed following SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis final preparation. native molecular mass found 240 kilodaltons. enzyme appears tetramer composed two different subunits. presence dithioerythritol (2 millimolar) required optimal activity purified enzyme.
