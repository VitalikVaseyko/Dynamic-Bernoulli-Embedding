 paper, report analysis acid formation E. coli pyk mutant. results demonstrate acid formation insignificant wild-type mutant low glucose concentrations. However, relatively high glucose concentrations, acid formation remains low mutant significant wild-type. substantial reduction acids accompanied increase CO(2) production. Moreover, unlike B. subtilis pyk mutant, E. coli pyk mutant show substantial increase PEP pool.
