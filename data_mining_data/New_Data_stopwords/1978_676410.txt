 Enzymopathies described concerning enzymes oxidative pentose phosphate pathway including glutathion system, majority glycolytic enzymes well ATPase, adenylate kinase pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase. distribution frequency enzymopathies differ strongly various regions world. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase show highest frequency. detected polymorphism pathological enzyme variants one reasons fact correlation decrease catalytic activity severity anaemias found. identification risk-groups precise methods necessary. Till detailed relationships enzymopathy non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemias clarified. Furthermore molecular mechanism instability pathological enzyme variants yet clear.
