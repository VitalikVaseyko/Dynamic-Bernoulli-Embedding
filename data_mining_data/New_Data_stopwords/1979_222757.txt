 Angiotensin II, catecholamines, vasopressin thought stimulate hepatic glycogenolysis gluconeogenesis via cyclic AMP-independent mechanism requires calcium ion. present study explores possibility angiotensin II vasopressin control activity regulatory enzymes carbohydrate metabolism Ca2+-dependent changes state phosphorylation. Intact hepatocytes labeled [32P]PO43- stimulated angiotensin II, glucagon, vasopressin 30 33 phosphorylated proteins resolved cytoplasmic fraction cell electrophoresis sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gels. Treatment cells angiotensin II vasopressin increased phosphorylation 10 12 cytosolic proteins without causing measurable changes cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Glucagon stimulated phosphorylation set 11 12 proteins marked increase cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. molecular weights three protein bands whose phosphorylation increased hormones correspond subunit molecular weights phosphorylase (Mr = 93,000), glycogen synthase (Mr = 85,000), pyruvate kinase (Mr = 61,000). Two phosphoprotein bands positively identified phosphorylase pyruvate kinase affinity chromatography immunoprecipitation, respectively. Incubation hepatocytes Ca2+-free medium completely abolished effects angiotensin II vasopressin protein phosphorylation alter glucagon. Treatment hepatocytes angiotensin II, glucagon, vasopressin stimulated phosphorylase activity 250 260%, inhibited glycogen synthase activity 50%, inhibited pyruvate kinase activity 30 35% (peptides) 70% (glucagon). effects angiotensin II vasopressin activity three enzymes completely abolished cells incubated Ca2+-free medium glucagon altered. results imply angiotensin II, catecholamines, vasopressin control hepatic carbohydrate metabolism Ca2+-requiring, cyclic AMP-independent pathway leads phosphorylation important regulatory enzymes.
