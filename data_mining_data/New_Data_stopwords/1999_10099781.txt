 Free bound forms hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase prepared brain sea scorpion (Scorpaena porcus) low ionic strength medium. Properties free bound forms compared determine whether binding particulate matter could influence enzyme function stability vivo. Changes pH differently affected activity free bound forms three enzymes. Furthermore, bound forms hexokinase pyruvate kinase stable free enzymes heating 45 degrees C. Bound hexokinase showed higher affinity substrates (ATP, glucose) free form bound lactate dehydrogenase greater affinity pyruvate NADH. Although affinities two forms pyruvate kinase substrates similar, Hill coefficients phosphoenolpyruvate well inhibition ATP differed two enzyme forms. Free bound lactate dehydrogenase also showed differences Hill coefficients bound lactate dehydrogenase less sensitive substrate inhibition high pyruvate concentrations. possible physiological role binding glycolytic enzymes subcellular structures discussed.
