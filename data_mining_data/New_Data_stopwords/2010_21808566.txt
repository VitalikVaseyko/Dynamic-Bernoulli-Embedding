 Catharanthus roseus Linn (Apocynaceae), traditional medicinal plant used control diabetes, various regions world. study evaluated possible antidiabetic hypolipidemic effect C. roseus (Catharanthus roseus) leaf powder diabetic rats.

Diabetic-treated control-treated rats treated C. roseus leaf powder suspension 2 ml distilled water, orally (100 mg/kg body weight/day/60 days). diabetic rats (D-group) plasma glucose increased plasma insulin decreased gradually. diabetic-treated group lowering plasma glucose increase plasma insulin observed 15 days end experimental period plasma glucose almost reached normal level, insulin not. significant enhancement plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL VLDL-cholesterol, atherogenic index diabetic rats normalized diabetic-treated rats. Decreased hepatic muscle glycogen content alterations activities enzymes glucose metabolism (glycogen phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), observed diabetic control rats, prevented C. roseus administration. results demonstrated C. roseus antidiabetic hypolipidemic properties could potential herbal medicine treating diabetes.
