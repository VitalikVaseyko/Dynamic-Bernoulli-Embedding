 salient feature failing heart metabolic remodeling towards predominant glucose metabolism activation fetal gene program. Sunitinib multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used treatment highly vascularized tumors. diabetic patients, sunitinib significantly decreases blood glucose. However, considerable proportion sunitinib-treated patients develop cardiac dysfunction failure. asked whether sunitinib treatment results shift towards glycolysis heart. Glucose uptake heart increased fivefold mice treated sunitinib. Transcript analysis qPCR revealed induction genes associated glycolysis reactivation fetal gene program. Additionally, observed shift enzyme pyruvate kinase adult M1 (PKM1) isoform fetal M2 (PKM2) isoform, hallmark Warburg Effect. novel observation led us examine whether similar shift occurs human heart failure. Examination tissue patients heart failure similarly displayed induction PKM2. Moreover, phenomenon partially reversed following mechanical unloading. propose pyruvate kinase isoform switching represents novel feature fetal gene program failing heart.
