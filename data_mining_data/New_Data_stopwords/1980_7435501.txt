 Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra determined intact erythrocytes patient homozygous beta-thalassemia three patients pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. intracellular 2,3-diphosphoglycerate-(2,3-DPG) mildly elevated thalassemia patient PK heterozygotes, markedly elevated PK-deficient homozygotes. 2,3-DPG chemical shifts patients' NMR spectra consistently positioned higher magnetic field normal. patients thalassemia PK deficiency transfused blood normal donor, patient's erythrocytes mixed normal erythrocytes, two distinct sets 2,3-DPG resonances appeared resulting spectra, allowing simultaneous quantification 2,3-DPG levels erythrocyte population. ability NMR detect heterogeneous cell populations may useful diagnosis congenital hemolytic anemias patients transfused.
