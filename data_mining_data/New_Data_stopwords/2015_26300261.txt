 role pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) cell proliferation controversial. unique function PKM2 proposed important proliferation cancer cells involves direct activity enzyme protein kinase; however, detailed biochemical characterization activity lacking. Using [(32)P]-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) examine direct substrates PKM2 using recombinant enzyme vitro systems PKM2 genetically deleted. Labeling protein species [(32)P]-PEP observed; however, dependent presence ADP, none dependent presence PKM2. addition, also failed observe PKM2-dependent transfer phosphate ATP directly protein. findings argue role PKM2 protein kinase.
