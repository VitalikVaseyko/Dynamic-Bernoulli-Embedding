 ongoing DNA damage caused reactive oxygen species generated oxidative metabolism considered key factor contributing cell aging well preconditioning cells neoplastic transformation. postulated significant fraction constitutive histone H2AX phosphorylation (CHP) constitutive activation ATM (CAA) seen untreated normal tumor cells occurs response DNA damage. present study, provide evidence support postulate. level ATM activation H2AX phosphorylation, detected immunocytochemically, monitored WI-38, A549, TK6 cells treated H2O2 well growing conditions known suspected affect level endogenous oxidants. Thirty- 60-min exposure cells 100 200 microM H2O2 led increase level H2AX phosphorylation ATM activation, particularly pronounced (nearly fivefold) S-phase cells. Cell growth 24-48 h hypoxic conditions (3% O2) distinctly lowered level CHP CAA minor effect cell cycle progression. Treatment (4 h) 0.1 0.3 mM 3-bromopyruvate, inhibitor glycolysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, reduced level CHP (up fourfold) also decreased level CAA. Growth WI-38 cells 2% serum concentration 48 h led 25 30% reduction CHP CHA, respectively, compared cells growing 10% serum. antioxidant vitamin C (2 mM) reduced CHP CAA 20-30% 24 h treatment, COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (5 microM) minor effect CHP CAA, though decreased level H2O2-induced H2AX phosphorylation ATM activation. contrast, dichloroacetate known shift metabolism anaerobic oxidative glycolysis effect pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase enhanced level CHP CAA. present data earlier observations strongly support postulate large fraction CHP CAA occurs response DNA damage caused metabolically generated oxidants. Cytometric analysis CHP CAA provides means measure effectiveness exogenous factors, either lowering aerobic metabolism neutralizing radicals may protect DNA damage.
