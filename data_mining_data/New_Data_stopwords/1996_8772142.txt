 role creatine kinase (CK) bound sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), energy supply SR ATPase situ, studied saponin-permeabilised rat ventricular fibres loading SR pCa 6. 5 different times different energy supply conditions. Release Ca2+ induced 5 mM caffeine peak relative tension (T/Tmax) area isometric tension curves, ST, measured. Taking advantage close localisation myofibrils SR, free [Ca2+] fibres release estimated using steady state [Ca2+]/tension relationship. Peak [Ca2+] integral free Ca2+ transients (S[Ca2+]f) calculated. times, loading 0.25 mM adenosine diphosphate, Mg2+ salt (MgADP) 12 mM phosphocreatine (PCr) [when adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated via bound CK] efficient loading 3.16 mM MgATP 12 mM PCr (control conditions). However, loading supported MgATP alone (3.16 mM), T/Tmax 40% S[Ca2+]f 31% control (P < 0.001). conditions, addition soluble ATP-regenerating system (pyruvate kinase phosphoenolpyruvate), increase loading substantially. ST S[Ca2+]f sensitive loading conditions T/Tmax peak [Ca2+]. data suggest Ca2+ uptake SR situ depends local ATP/ADP ratio effectively controlled bound CK.
