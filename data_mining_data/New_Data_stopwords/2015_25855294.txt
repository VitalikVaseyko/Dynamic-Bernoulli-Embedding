 Cancer cells adapt metabolic processes support rapid proliferation, less known cancer cells alter metabolism promote cell survival poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment. identify key role serine glycine metabolism survival brain cancer cells within ischaemic zones gliomas. human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) highly expressed pseudopalisading cells surround necrotic foci. find SHMT2 activity limits pyruvate kinase (PKM2) reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting metabolic state confers profound survival advantage cells poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells high SHMT2 levels excess glycine metabolized GLDC converted toxic molecules aminoacetone methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 required cancer cells adapt tumour environment, also renders cells sensitive glycine cleavage system inhibition.
