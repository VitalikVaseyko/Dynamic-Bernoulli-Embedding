 Cell survival death-inducing signals tightly associated other, decision whether cell survives dies determined controlling relationship signals. However, mechanism underlying reciprocal regulation signals remains unclear. study, reveal functional association PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1), critical mediator cell survival, ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), apoptotic stress-activated MAPKKK. physical association PDK1 ASK1 mediated pleckstrin homology domain PDK1 C-terminal regulatory domain ASK1 decreased ASK1-activating stimuli, H(2)O(2), tumor necrosis factor alpha, thapsigargin, ionomycin, well insulin, PDK1 stimulator. Wild-type PDK1, kinase-dead PDK1, negatively regulates ASK1 activity phosphorylating Ser(967), binding site 14-3-3 protein, ASK1. PDK1 functionally suppresses ASK1-mediated AP-1 transactivation H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis kinase-dependent manner. hand, ASK1 shown inhibit PDK1 functions, including PDK1-mediated regulation apoptosis cell growth, phosphorylating PDK1 Ser(394) Ser(398), indicating putative phosphorylation sites involved negative regulation PDK1 activity. results provide evidence PDK1 ASK1 directly interact phosphorylate act negative regulators respective kinases resting cells.
