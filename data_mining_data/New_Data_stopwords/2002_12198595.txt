 control alteration key regulatory enzymes determinant reactions pathways intermediary metabolism mammalian cells. important mechanism metabolic control hormonal regulation genes associated transcription biosynthesis key enzymes. secretory epithelial cells prostate gland humans animals possess unique citrate-related metabolic pathway regulated testosterone prolactin. specialized hormone-regulated metabolic activity responsible major prostate function production secretion extraordinarily high levels citrate. key regulatory enzymes directly associated citrate production prostate cells mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial aconitase. Testosterone prolactin involved regulation corresponding genes associated enzymes (which refer "metabolic genes"). regulatory regions genes contain necessary response elements confer ability hormones control gene transcription. report, describe role protein kinase c (PKC) signaling pathway prolactin regulation metabolic genes prostate cells. Testosterone prolactin regulation metabolic genes (which constitutively expressed mammalian cells) specific citrate-producing cells. hope review provide strong basis future studies regarding hormonal regulation citrate-related intermediary metabolism. importantly, altered citrate metabolism persistent distinguishing characteristic (decreased citrate production) prostate cancer (PCa) also (increased citrate production) benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). understanding role hormonal regulation metabolism essential understanding pathogenesis prostate disease. relationships described regulation prostate cell metabolism provides insight mechanisms hormonal regulation mammalian cells general.
