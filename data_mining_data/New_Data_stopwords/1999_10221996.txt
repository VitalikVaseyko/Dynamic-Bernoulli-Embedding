 microplate assay mevalonate 5-phosphomevalonate kinase activities developed using enzyme-coupled system pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase. Mevalonate 5-phosphomevalonate kinase activities measured crude partially purified enzyme preparations Catharanthus roseus suspension-cultured plant cells. assay validated respect protein substrate concentration. Mevalonate 5-phosphomevalonate kinase showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics respect ATP specific substrates; apparent Km values mevalonate kinase ATP mevalonate 210 65 microM, respectively, 5-phosphomevalonate kinase ATP 5-phosphomevalonate 0.41 0.4 mM, respectively. Considering mevalonate kinase, relative standard deviation enzyme activity within determination (n = 3) always less 2.5% determinations (n = 9) less 2%. method used continuous assay well discontinuous assay.
