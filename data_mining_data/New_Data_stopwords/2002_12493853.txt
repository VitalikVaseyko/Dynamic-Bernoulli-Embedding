 Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), negative regulator mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC), plays pivotal role controlling mtPDC activity, hence, TCA cycle cell respiration. Previously, cloning PDHK cDNA Arabidopsis thaliana effects constitutively down-regulating expression plant growth development reported. first detailed analyses biochemical physiological effects partial silencing mtPDHK A. thaliana using antisense constructs driven constitutive seed-specific promoters reported here. studies revealed increased level respiration leaves constitutive antisense PDHK transgenics; increase respiration also found developing seeds seed-specific antisense transgenics. constitutive seed-specific partial silencing mtPDHK resulted increased seed oil content seed weight maturity. Feeding 3-(14)C pyruvate bolted stems containing siliques (constitutive transgenics), isolated siliques immature seeds (seed-specific transgenics) confirmed higher rate incorporation radiolabel seed lipid species, particularly triacylglycerols. Neither constitutive seed-specific partial silencing PDHK negatively affected overall silique seed development. Instead, oil seed yield, overall plant productivity improved. findings suggest partial reduction repression mtPDC antisense PDHK expression alter carbon flux and, particular, contribution carbon moieties pyruvate fatty acid biosynthesis storage lipid accumulation developing seeds, implicating role mtPDC fatty acid biosynthesis seeds.
