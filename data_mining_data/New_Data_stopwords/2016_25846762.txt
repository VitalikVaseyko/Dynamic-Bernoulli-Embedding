 Dichloroacetate (DCA) beneficial cancer therapy induces apoptosis decreases cancer growth vitro vivo without affecting non-cancer cells. DCA stimulates activity enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Consequently, DCA promotes oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis. Therefore, DCA produces changes energy metabolism could affect mitochondrial network mitophagy. investigation determined effects DCA treatment mitophagy human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells cultured distributed 3 groups: control, NH4Cl chloroquine. group treated DCA 0, 5, 30 60 mM 16 h. Samples analyzed cell viability, mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial network morphology expression key proteins involved mitochondrial dynamics, LC3b, FIS1, OPA1, PARKIN PINK1. groups, DCA caused decrease cell viability, induction autophagy dose-dependent manner decrease Tim23, FIS1 PARKIN protein expression, leading profound morphological changes mitochondrial network resulting shorter fragmented filaments. However, TFAM protein levels remained unchanged. Similarly, mitochondrial copy number significantly different among treatment groups. conclusion, DCA induces mitophagy remodeling mitochondrial network. remodeling, DCA induces decrease expression key proteins involved protein degradation mitochondrial dynamics significantly affect mtDNA density. Blocking late phase autophagy increases effects DCA, suggesting autophagy protects cell, least partially, DCA.
