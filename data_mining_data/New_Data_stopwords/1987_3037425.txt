 present study effects chronic administration dextroamphetamine energy metabolism brain rat examined. enzymes studied were: hexokinase (soluble particulate forms), phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, NAD+ NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, succinate dehydrogenase malate dehydrogenase. activities enzymes assayed four regions brain rat (cerebellum, medulla oblongata pons, cererbral cortex diencephalon). Rats injected intaperitoneally daily dextroamphetamine 20 consecutive days. initial dose 5 mg/kg/day dose increased 1 mg/kg/every 5 days total 8 mg/kg/day days 16-20. glycolytic enzymes reduction activity phosphofructokinase found diencephalon increase activity pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase diencephalon medulla oblongata pons, respectively. Citrate synthase enzyme Krebs' cycle affected chronic administration dextroamphetamine. results presented show chronic administration dextroamphetamine produced important changes enzymes glycolysis Krebs' cycle brain rat.
