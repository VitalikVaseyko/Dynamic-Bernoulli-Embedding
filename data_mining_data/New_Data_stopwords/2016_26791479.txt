 Gliomas common primary brain tumors either benign malignant originating glial tissue. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) prevalent aggressive form among gliomas, associated decimal prognosis due it`s high invasive nature. GBM also characterized high recurrence rate apoptosis resistance features make therapeutic targeting challenging. Mitochondria key cellular organelles acting focal points diverse array cellular functions cellular energy metabolism, regulation ion homeostasis, redox signaling cell death. Eventual findings mitochondrial dysfunction include preference glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation, enhanced reactive oxygen species generation abnormal mitochondria mediated apoptotic machinery frequently observed various malignancies including gliomas. particular, gliomas harbor mitochondrial structure abnormalities, genomic mutations mtDNA, altered energy metabolism (Warburg effect) along mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme. Numerous natural compounds shown efficacy treatment gliomas targeting mitochondrial aberrant signaling cascades. natural compounds directly target components mitochondria whereas others act indirectly modulating metabolic abnormalities consequence mitochondrial dysfunction. present review offers molecular insight mitochondrial pathology gliomas therapeutic mechanisms promising natural compounds target mitochondrial dysfunction. review also sheds light challenges possible ways overcome hurdles associated natural compounds enter clinical market.
