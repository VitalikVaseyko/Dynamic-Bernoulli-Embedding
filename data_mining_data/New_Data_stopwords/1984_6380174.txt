 study made effects agents stability unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase type L, enzyme phosphorylated cyclic 3',5'-AMP-stimulated protein kinase subtilisin-modified enzyme form phosphorylatable site removed. phosphorylated pyruvate kinase found labile enzyme forms high temperature presence urea. circular dichroism spectrum phosphorylated enzyme also differed unphosphorylated proteolytically modified forms. three forms enzyme showed high degree stability wide pH range. unphosphorylated enzyme seemed, however, sensitive differences pH. 10% maximal activity remained incubation pH 10 30 degrees C 30 min, compared 30% 75% phosphorylated proteolytically modified forms enzyme, respectively. three enzyme forms tested subtilisin-modified pyruvate kinase rapidly inactivated trypsin. results taken together suggest phosphorylated enzyme less ordered structure two enzyme forms studied.
