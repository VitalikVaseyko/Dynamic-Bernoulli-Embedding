 highly sensitive enzymatic assay diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P3-triphosphate (Ap3A) established basis coupled luminescence assay diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (A. Ogilvie (1981) Anal. Biochem. 115, 302-307). Snake venom phosphodiesterase splits Ap3A AMP plus ADP measured luminescence reaction containing pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate luciferin-luciferase. procedure linear Ap3A levels ranging 0.1 2 pmol. assay used measure Ap3A various eukaryotic cells ion-exchange chromatography high-performance liquid chromatography acidic extracts cells. level diadenosine triphosphate higher instances level diadenosine tetraphosphate. growing abdominal cavity mice, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells contained high amounts Ap3A (0.1 nmol/10(6) cells), allowing direct optical determination HPLC chromatography. quantitative measurement Ap3A luminescence assay gave identical results. Ap3A extracted Ehrlich cells also chromatographed authentic nucleotide two thin-layer systems providing additional proof existence Ap3A biological material.
