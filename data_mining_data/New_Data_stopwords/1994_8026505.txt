 paper describes sequence adenylate kinase (Mg-ATP+AMP<-->Mg-ADP+ADP) maize chloroplasts. light-inducible enzyme important efficient CO2 fixation C4 cycle, removing recycling AMP produced reversible pyruvate phosphate dikinase reaction. complete sequence determined analyzing peptides cleavages trypsin, AspN protease CNBr subcleavage major CNBr peptide chymotrypsin. N-terminal Edman degradation carboxypeptidase digestion established terminal residues. Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed final sequence 222 residues (M(r) = 24867) including one cysteine one tryptophan. sequence shows enzyme long-variant-type adenylate kinase, nearest relatives adenylate kinases Enterobacteriaceae. Alignment sequence adenylate kinase Escherichia coli reveals 44% identical residues. Since E. coli structure published recently 0.19-nm resolution inhibitor adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A) [Muller, C. W. & Schulz, G. E. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224, 159-177], catalytically essential residues could compared found mostly conserved. Surprisingly, nucleotide-binding Gly-rich loop Gly-Xaa-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly-Lys middle Gly replaced Ala. is, however, compensated Ile-->Val exchange nearest spatial neighborhood. Thr-->Ala exchange explains unusual tolerance enzyme pyrimidine nucleotides acceptor site.
