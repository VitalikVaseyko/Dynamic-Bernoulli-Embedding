 (A) effects phosphate, chloride, nitrate, pyruvate, malate, succinate glutamate ions kinetics yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP: 3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.3) studied MgATP2- 3-P-glycerate variable substrates. Three types patterns obtained: (1) Nitrate, succinate, malate glutamate ions, strictly noncompetitive versus substrates. (2) Phosphate chloride ions, noncompetitive versus MgATP2- mixed versus 3-P-glycerate. (3) Pyruvate ions, weak inhibitors, competitive MgATP2- noncompetitive 3-P-glycerate. (B) Based experiments simultaneous inhibition various combinations two anions following suggestions made: type 1 anions presumably bind site outside active centre. ions appear bind enzyme independently type 2. latter also appears include sulfate ions, competitive versus substrates well versus phosphate chloride ions. Sulfate phosphate ions electronically similar, show different inhibition patterns, presumably due various effects protein conformation. Type 3 inhibition exerted pyruvate ions shown earlier 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate salicylate ions, two anions supposed bind adenine binding pocket catalytic centre, results indicate pyruvate ions might preferably compete nucleotide substrate polyphosphate binding site.
