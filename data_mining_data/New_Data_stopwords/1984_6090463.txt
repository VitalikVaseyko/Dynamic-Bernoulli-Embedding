 Cyclic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade systems responsible regulating numerous metabolic pathways. capacity cyclic cascade system maintain steady-state level phosphorylation and, hence, specific biological activity phosphorylatable protein dependent upon constant supply metabolic energy (ATP). Quantification extent ATP consumption cyclic cascade examined experimentally model vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system described detail previous paper (Shacter, E., Chock, P. B., Stadtman, E. R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12252-12259). results indicate (a) concentrations converter enzymes interconvertible substrate held constant fractional phosphorylation substrate varied changing allosteric effector concentrations, rate ATP consumption monocyclic cascade directly proportional steady-state level phosphorylation maintained. (b) Attainment particular steady-state level phosphorylation determined net ratio protein kinase phosphatase activities independent absolute concentrations enzymes. (c) Whereas time required reach given steady state inversely proportional converter enzyme concentrations, amount ATP consumed maintaining steady state directly proportional kinase phosphatase concentrations. addition, theoretical analysis based upon experimentally determined parameters two vivo cyclic cascade systems (pyruvate kinase glycogen phosphorylase) revealed normal conditions, cyclic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades consume small proportion (less 0.02%) total cellular energy flux.
