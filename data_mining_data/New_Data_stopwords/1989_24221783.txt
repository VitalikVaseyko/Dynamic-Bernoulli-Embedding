 review addresses direct indirect metabolic actions hormones co-encoded preproglucagon gene fishes. Emphasis placed critical analysis effects glucagon glucagon-like peptide (GLP) current knowledge respective modes action reviewed. mammals GLPs exert direct metabolic actions. fish liver, GLP glucagon act similar targets intermediary metabolism enhancing flux glycogenolysis, lipolysis gluconeogenesis. Increases substrate oxidation uniform. Hormonal activation glycogen phosphorylase triglyceride lipase inhibition pyruvate kinase implicated actions. Hormone-dependent hyperglycemia, depletion hepatic glycogen increases free fatty acids noticeablein vivo. Glucagon also activates hepatic amino acid uptake ammonia excretion.Glucagon actions accompanied large increases hepatic cAMP increased phosphorylation pyruvate kinase. Metabolic effects measured GLP administration associated minor, any, increases cAMP effects pyruvate kinase variable. hypothesize different hepatic receptors differing modes intracellular message transduction involved glucagon GLP actions targetting identical metabolic routes. Responses different species fish cover wide spectrum, variation response circannual cycle experimental animals makes comparisons results, even within one species, difficult.
