 BACKGROUND: tumor pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) involved glycolytic pathway lung cancer targeting kinase observed radiosensitize non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OBJECTIVE: integration silico virtual screening vitro kinase assay described discover novel PKM2 inhibitors candidate library containing >400,000 commercially available compounds. METHOD: method stepwise screening scheme first used empirical strategies fast exclude undruggable compounds library employed molecular docking molecular dynamics (MD)-based rescoring identify potential hits. Subsequently, computational findings substantiated using standard kinase assay protocol. RESULTS: Four compounds, i.e. nalidixic acid, indoprofen, hematoxylin polydatin, identified inhibit PKM2 kinase micromolar level, IC50 values 53, 21, 340 128 .M, respectively. CONCLUSION: Structural analysis revealed hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, pi-pi stacking hydrophobic forces co-confer high stability strong specificity PKM2-inhibitor binding.
