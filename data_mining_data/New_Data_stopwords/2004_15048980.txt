 better understand mechanism underlying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis search potential markers HCC prognosis, differential proteome analysis two HCC cell strains high low metastatic potentials, MHCC97-H MHCC97-L, conducted using two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis followed matrix-assisted laser desorption/time flight mass spectrometry liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry. Image analysis silver-stained 2-D gels revealed 56 protein spots showed significant differential expression MHCC97-H MHCC97-L cells (Student's t-test, P < 0.05) 4 protein spots detected MHCC97-H cells. Fourteen protein spots identified using in-gel tryptic digestion, peptide mass fingerprinting tandem mass spectrometry. expressions pyruvate kinase M2, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, laminin receptor 67 kDa, S100 calcium-binding protein A4, thioredoxin cytokeratin 19 elevated MHCC97-H cells. However, manganese superoxide dismutase, calreticulin precursor, cathepsin D, lactate dehydrogenase B, non-metastatic cell protein 1, cofilin 1 calumenin precursor down-regulated MHCC97-H cells. Intriguingly, identified proteins reported associated tumor metastasis. functional implications alterations levels proteins discussed.
