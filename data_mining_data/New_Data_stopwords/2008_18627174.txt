 Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDHK2) phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDC) thereby controls rate oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate. activity PDHK2 regulated variety metabolites pyruvate, NAD (+), NADH, CoA, acetyl-CoA. inhibitory effect pyruvate occurs unique binding site, specific pyruvate synthetic analogue dichloroacetate (DCA). effects NAD (+), NADH, CoA, acetyl-CoA mediated binding site recognizes inner lipoyl-bearing domain (L2) dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2). allosteric sites separated active site PDHK2 20 A. show mutations three amino acid residues located vicinity active site PDHK2 (R250, T302, Y320) make kinase resistant inhibitory effect DCA, thereby uncoupling active site allosteric site. addition, provide evidence substitutions R250 T302 partially completely uncouple L2-binding site. Based available structural data, R250, T302, Y320 stabilize "open" "closed" conformations built-in lid controls access nucleotide nucleotide-binding cavity. strongly suggests mobility ATP lid central allosteric regulation PDHK2 activity serving conformational switch required communication active site allosteric sites kinase molecule.
