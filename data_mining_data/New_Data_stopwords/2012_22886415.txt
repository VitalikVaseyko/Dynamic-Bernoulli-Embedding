 become appreciated last several years protein phosphorylation within cardiac mitochondrial matrix respiratory complexes extensive. Given importance oxidative phosphorylation balance energy metabolism heart, potential regulatory effect classical signaling events mitochondrial function interest. However, functional impact protein phosphorylation kinase/phosphatase system responsible relatively unknown. Exceptions include well-characterized pyruvate dehydrogenase branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase regulatory system. first task review update current status protein phosphorylation detection primarily matrix evaluate evidence linking events enzymatic function protein processing. manage scope effort, focused pathways involved energy metabolism. high sensitivity modern methods detecting protein phosphorylation low specificity many kinases suggests detection protein phosphorylation sites without information mole fraction phosphorylation difficult interpret, especially metabolic enzymes, likely irrelevant function. However, several systems including protein translocation, adenine nucleotide translocase, cytochrome c, complex IV protein phosphorylation well correlated enzymatic function along classical dehydrogenase systems. second task review current understanding kinase/phosphatase system within matrix. Though clear protein phosphorylation occurs within matrix, based (32)P incorporation quantitative mass spectrometry measures, kinase/phosphatase system responsible process ill-defined. argument presented remnants much labile bacterial protein phosphoryl transfer system may present matrix evaluation possibility require application approaches developed bacterial cell signaling mitochondria.
