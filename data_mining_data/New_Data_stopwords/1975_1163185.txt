 50 cc 6%, oxygenated non oxygenated stroma-free heamoglobin solution transfused rabbits previous removal one third circulating blood volume. experimental investigations carried animals barbiturate anaesthesia. Oxygen consumption determined using Warburg microrespirator. Posthaemorrhagic hypotension developing bleeding caused significant increase oxygen consumption liver tissue. Transfusion non oxygenated stroma-free haemoglobin solution caused increase oxygen consumption, transfusion oxygenated stroma-free haemoglobin solution slightly decreased oxygen consumption compared values observed post haemorrhagic hypotension.
