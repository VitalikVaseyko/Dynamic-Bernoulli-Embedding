 Accumulation high level lactate negatively impact cell growth fed-batch culture process. study, attempted knockout lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) gene CHO cells order attenuate lactate level. prevent potential deleterious effect pyruvate accumulation, consequent LDHA knockout, cell culture, chose pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, 2, 3 (PDHK1, 2, 3) knockdown cell line knock LDHA alleles. Around 3,000 clones screened obtain 152 mutants. heterozygous mutants identified. attempt knockout remaining wild-type allele one heterozygote yielded two mutants screening 567 clones. One extra valine. Another evidenced duplication event, possessing lease one wild-type two different frameshifted alleles. mutants still retained LDH activity. Together, data strongly suggest complete knockout LDHA lethal CHO cells, despite simultaneous down-regulation PDHK1, 2, 3.
