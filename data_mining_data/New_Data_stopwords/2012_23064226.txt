 Cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes critical cell growth proliferation. Specifically, overexpress M2 isoform tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), controls glycolytic flux, highly dependent de novo biosynthesis serine glycine. describe new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship PKM2 activity serine biosynthesis. show serine bind activate human PKM2, PKM2 activity cells reduced response serine deprivation. reduction PKM2 activity shifts cells fuel-efficient mode pyruvate diverted mitochondria glucose-derived carbon channelled serine biosynthesis support cell proliferation.
