 Molybdate (Mo) exerts insulinomimetic effects vitro. study, evaluated whether Mo improve glucose homeostasis genetically obese, insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. Oral administration Mo (174 mg/kg molybdenum element) 7 weeks affect body weight, decreased hyperglycaemia (approximately 20 mM) obese mice levels lean (L) (+/+) mice, reduced hyperinsulinaemia one-sixth pretreatment levels. Tolerance oral glucose improved: total glucose area 30% lower Mo-treated mice untreated ob/ob mice (O), total insulin area halved. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) mRNA level activity unchanged mice compared L mice, mRNA level activity L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) increased mice 3.5- 1.7-fold respectively. Mo treatment increased GK mRNA levels activity (by approximately 2.2-fold 61% compared values), no, mild, effect already increased L-PK variables. mRNA levels activity gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) augmented liver (sixfold 57% respectively), reduced Mo treatment. Insulin binding partially purified receptors liver reduced mice restored Mo treatment. Despite correction, overall receptor tyrosine kinase activity improved Mo mice. Moreover, overexpression (by two- fourfold) cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) white adipose tissue, may determinant role insulin resistance mice, unaffected Mo. Likewise, overexpression ob gene white adipose tissue unchanged Mo. conclusion, Mo markedly improved glucose homeostasis ob/ob mice insulin-like action appeared exerted distal insulin receptor tyrosine kinase step. blood glucose-lowering effect Mo unrelated over-expression TNF alpha ob genes mice, resulted least part attenuation liver insulin resistance reversal pre-translational regulatory defects mice.
