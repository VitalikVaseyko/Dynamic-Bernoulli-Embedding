 Normal human erythrocytes (RBC) freeze-dried conditions caused minimal modification normal RBC metabolic activities. known effects long-term storage metabolic activities, studied effects lyophilization process RBC metabolism. metabolic enzymes studied, triosephosphate isomerase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1), enolase (2-phospho-D-glyceratehydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate O2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) decreased compared fresh control nonlyophilized RBC. activities enzymes differ significantly blood bank RBC. Concentrations high-energy intermediates, ATP, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, along lactate ATP production decreased lyophilized RBC. enzymes pentose phosphate shunt altered lyophilization. addition, data show lyophilized RBC possess intact capacity (i) synthesize adenine nucleotides (ii) reduce MetHb Hb and, thus, maintain Hb functional physiologic state similar fresh nonlyophilized RBC. present study demonstrates possibility lyophilizing RBC manner maintains normal metabolic enzymatic function upon rehydration.
