 elasticities different steps carbohydrate catabolism tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta estimated perturbation experiments. data used calculate flux metabolite control coefficients. Enzyme elasticities also calculated rate equations independent estimate flux control coefficients phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase made inhibitor titration. values obtained flux control coefficients carbohydrate breakdown H. diminuta consistent pathway thought controlled vivo. sensitivity analysis flux control coefficients important regulatory enzymes pathway shows hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase three four key elasticities significant effect coefficient. glycogen synthase, major factor determining magnitude flux control coefficient relative flux branch.
