 AIM STUDY: aim study evaluate platelet enzyme activity cases leukemia. MATERIALS METHODS: Platelet enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), pyruvate kinase (PK) hexokinase (HK) studied 47 patients acute chronic leukemia patients, 16 patients acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(13 relapse, three remission), 12 patients acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (five relapse, seven remission), 19 patients chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). RESULTS: platelet G6PD activity significantly low cases AML, also CML. G6PD activity normalized AML remission. G6PD activity, although persistently low remission, increased significantly near-normal remission (P < 0.05) compared relapse (P < 0.01). Platelet PK activity high AML relapse (P < 0.05), normalized remission. Platelet HK however found decreased remission (P < 0.05). significant positive correlation G6PD PK cases AML (P < 0.001) CML. G6PD activity correlate HK activity leukemic groups. significant positive correlation however seen PK HK activity cases remission (P < 0.01) CML (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: red cell platelet enzymes studied 36 leukemic patients statistically significant correlation red cell platelet enzymes. Platelet enzyme defect leukemias suggests inherent abnormality megakaryopoiesis would explain functional platelet defects leukemias.
