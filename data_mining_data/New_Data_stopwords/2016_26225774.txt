 survival cell depends ability meet energy requirements. hypothesized mitochondrial reserve respiratory capacity (RRC) cell critical component bioenergetics utilized increase energy demand, thereby, enhancing viability. goal identify elements regulate contribute development RRC involvement cell survival. results show activation metabolic sensors, including pyruvate dehydrogenase AMP-dependent kinase, increases cardiac myocyte RRC via Sirt3-dependent mechanism. Notably, identified mitochondrial complex II (cII) target metabolic sensors main source RRC. Moreover, show RRC, via cII, correlates enhanced cell survival hypoxia. Thus, first time, show metabolic sensors via Sirt3 maximize cellular RRC activating cII, enhances cell survival hypoxia.
