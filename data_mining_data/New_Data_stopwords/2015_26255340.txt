 established cells Nocardia vaccinii IMB B-7405 (surfactant producer) glucose catabolism performed pentose phosphate cycle well gluconate (activity NAD+-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase FAD+-dependent glucose dehydrogenase 835 +/- 41 698 +/- 35 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein respectively). 6-Phosphogluconate formed gluconokinase reaction involved pentose phosphate cycle (activity constitutive NADP+-dependent 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 357 +/- 17 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein). Glycerol catabolism dihydroxyacetonephosphate (the intermediate glycolysis) may performed two ways: glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol kinase activity 244 +/- 12 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein) dihydroxyacetone. Replenishment C4-dicarboxylic acids pool N. vaccinii IMV B-7405 grown glucose glycerol occurs phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP)carboxylase reaction (714-803 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein). 2-Oxoglutarate involved tricarboxylic acid cycle alternate pathway participation 2-oxoglutarate synthase. observed activity key enzymes gluconeogenesis (PEP-carboxykinase PEP-synthase), trehalose phosphate synthase NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase confirmed ability IMV B-7405 strain synthesis surface active glycoand aminolipids, respectively.
