 rate Z. mobilis (Entner-Doudoroff pathway) converts high concentrations glucose (20%) ethanol plus CO2 changes ethanol accumulates surrounding broth. decline glycolytic activity (per milligram cell protein) result inhibitory effects ethanol, reversed immediately ethanol removal. peak fermentative activity (58 mumol CO2 evolved per mg cell protein per h) occurred accumulation 1.1% ethanol (18 h) declined one-half rate 30 h (6.2% accumulated ethanol), although cell number continued increase. times corresponded end exponential growth onset stationary phase (on basis measurement cell protein), respectively. examination many requirements fermentation (nucleotides, magnesium, enzyme levels, intracellular pH, delta pH) revealed three possible reasons early decline activity: decreased abundance nucleotides, decrease internal pH 6.3 5.3, decrease specific activities two glycolytic enzymes (pyruvate kinase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra perchlorate extracts cells fermenting broth revealed low levels glycolytic intermediates (Entner-Doudoroff pathway) cells examined peak fermentative activity (18-h cells) comparison cells examined later stage (30-h cells), consistent limitation fermentation rate glycolytic enzymes near end pathway. likely cell death (loss colony-forming ability) collapse delta pH also contribute decline fermentative activity 30 h.
