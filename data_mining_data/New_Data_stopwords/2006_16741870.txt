 Amphibian metamorphosis strict control thyroid hormones (TH). hormones induce metamorphosis controlling gene expression binding thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Necturus maculosus considered obligatory paedomorphic Amphibian since metamorphosis never occurs spontaneously cannot induced pharmacological means. Since metamorphosis depends acquisition response tadpole tissues thyroid hormone, aimed determine TR gene expression patterns Necturus maculosus well expression two TH-related genes: Cytosolic Thyroid Hormone-Binding Protein (CTHBP)-M2-pyruvate kinase, gene encoding cytosolic TH binding protein stromelysin 3, direct TH target gene Xenopus laevis. Tissue samples obtained specimens Necturus maculosus. performed situ hybridization using non-cross-hybridizing RNA probes obtained cloned Necturus TRalpha TRbeta genes. found clear expression Necturus TRalpha gene several tissues including central nervous system, epithelial cells digestive urinary organs, well myocardium skeletal muscle. TRbeta also expressed brain. tissues, hybridization signals low draw reliable conclusions precise distribution. addition, observed expression CTHBP ST3 largely distinct TRs. fact observed clear expression TRalpha TRbeta evolutionary conserved, suggests Necturus tissues express TRs. results thus indicate that, contrast previously held hypotheses, Necturus tissues TH responsive.
