 Kinases use ATP phosphorylate substrates; recent findings underscore additional regulatory roles ATP. Here, propose mechanism allosteric regulation Akt1 kinase phosphorylation ATP. 4.7-mus molecular dynamics simulations Akt1 mutants ATP/ADP bound/unbound states revealed ATP occupancy ATP-binding site stabilizes closed conformation, allosterically protecting pT308 restraining phosphatase access key interconnected residues ATP-->pT308 allosteric pathway. Following ATP-->ADP hydrolysis, pT308 exposed readily dephosphorylated. Site-directed mutagenesis validated predictions indicated mutations impair PDK1 PP2A phosphatase recruitment. probed function residues around pT308 atomic level, predicted experimentally confirmed Akt1(H194R/R273H) double mutant rescues pathology-related Akt1(R273H). Analysis classical Akt homologs suggests mechanism provide general model allosteric kinase regulation ATP; such, offers potential avenue allosteric drug discovery.
