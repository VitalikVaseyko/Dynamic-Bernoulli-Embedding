 phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) - phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) cascade plays critical role cardiovascular development tumor genesis. role PDK1 microenvironment heart tumor remains unknown. clarify effects PDK1 tissue microenvironment vivo, here, created alpha-SMA-Cre-mediated excision PDK1 mice. mice injected subcutaneously Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. found PDK1-deficient mice post-natal praecox dilated cardiomyopathy, decelerated tumor growth severe tumor metastasis. Histopathological analysis revealed abnormality vascular microenvironment heart primary tumor. conclusion, PDK1 plays pivotal role regulating cardiac function tumor metastasis interfering microenvironment.
