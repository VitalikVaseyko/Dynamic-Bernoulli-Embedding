 BACKGROUND: Synthetic biology allows development new biochemical pathways production chemicals renewable sources. One major challenge identification suitable microorganisms hold pathways sufficient robustness high yield. work analyzed genome propionic acid producer Actinobacteria Propionibacterium acidipropionici (ATCC 4875). RESULTS: assembled P. acidipropionici genome 3,656,170 base pairs (bp) 68.8% G + C content low-copy plasmid 6,868 bp. identified 3,336 protein coding genes, approximately 1000 P. freudenreichii P. acnes, increase number genes putatively involved maintenance genome integrity, well presence invertase genes putatively involved carbon catabolite repression. addition, made experimental confirmation ability P. acidipropionici fix CO2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase coding gene found genome. Instead, identified pyruvate carboxylase gene confirmed presence corresponding enzyme proteome analysis potential candidate activity. Similarly, phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase genes, considered responsible acetate formation, present genome. P. acidipropionici, similar function seems performed ADP forming acetate-CoA ligase gene corresponding enzyme confirmed proteome analysis. CONCLUSIONS: data shows P. acidipropionici several desired features required become platform production chemical commodities: multiple pathways efficient feedstock utilization, ability fix CO2, robustness, efficient production propionic acid, potential precursor valuable 3-carbon compounds.
