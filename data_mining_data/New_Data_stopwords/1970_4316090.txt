 1. Changes concentrations ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alanine, aspartate, malate, lactate, pyruvate, NAD(+), NADH adenine nucleotides measured freeze-clamped rat liver ischaemia. 2. Although concentrations metabolites changed rapidly ischaemia ratios [glutamate]/[2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)] [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] changed equally value expression [3-hydroxybutyrate][2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)]/[acetoacetate][glutamate] remained approximately constant, indicating 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase glutamate dehydrogenase systems near-equilibrium mitochondrial NAD(+) couple. 3. value expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] 0.7 vivo remained fairly constant ischaemic period 5min, although concentrations alanine oxoglutarate changed substantially. explanation offered value ratio differed equilibrium constant alanine aminotransferase reaction, 1.48. 4. Injection l-cycloserine 60min rats killed increased concentration alanine liver fourfold decreased concentration metabolites measured, except pyruvate. ischaemia concentration alanine change aspartate almost doubled. 5. treatment l-cycloserine value vivo expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] rose 0.7 2.4. ischaemia value returned 0.8. 6. effects l-cycloserine consistent assumption specifically inhibits alanine aminotransferase. 7. alanine formed ischaemia probably derived pyruvate ammonia released deamination adenine nucleotides glutamine. alanine presumably formed combined action glutamate dehydrogenase alanine aminotransferase. 8. rate anaerobic glycolysis, calculated increase lactate concentration, 1.3mumol/min per g fresh wt. 9. Although concentrations adenine nucleotides changed rapidly ischaemia, ratio [ATP][AMP]/[ADP](2) remained constant 0.54, indicating adenylate kinase established near-equilibrium conditions.
