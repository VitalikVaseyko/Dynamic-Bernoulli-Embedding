 Dichloroacetate (DCA) promotes pyruvate entry Krebs cycle inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase thereby maintaining PDH active dephosphorylated state. DCA recently gained attention potential metabolic-targeting therapy heart failure molecular basis therapeutic effect DCA heart remains mystery. Once-daily oral administration DCA alleviates pressure overload-induced left ventricular remodeling. examined changes metabolic fate pyruvate carbon (derived glucose) entering Krebs cycle metabolic interventions DCA. (13)C6-glucose pathway tracing analysis revealed instead completely oxidized mitochondria ATP production, DCA-mediated PDH dephosphorylation results increased acetyl-CoA pool control pressure-overloaded hearts. DCA induces hyperacetylation histone H3K9 H4 dose-dependent manner parallel dephosphorylation PDH cultured cardiomyocytes. DCA administration increases histone H3K9 acetylation vivo mouse heart. Interestingly, DCA-dependent histone acetylation associated up-regulation 2.3% genes (545 23,474 examined). Gene ontology analysis revealed genes highly enriched transcription-related categories. evidence suggests sustained activation PDH DCA results overproduction acetyl-CoA, exceeds oxidation Krebs cycle results histone acetylation. propose DCA-mediated PDH activation potential induce epigenetic remodeling heart, which, least part, forms molecular basis therapeutic effect DCA heart.
