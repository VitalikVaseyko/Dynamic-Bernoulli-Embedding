 Type 2 diabetes characterized progressive resistance peripheral tissues insulin. Recent data established lipid phosphatase SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) critical negative regulator insulin signal transduction. Mutations SHIP2 gene associated type 2 diabetes. Here, used hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic KKA(y) mice gain insight signaling events metabolic changes triggered SHIP2 inhibition vivo. Liver-specific expression dominant-negative SHIP2 mutant KKA(y) mice increased basal insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Protein levels glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase significantly reduced, consequently liver produced less glucose gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, SHIP2 inhibition improved hepatic glycogen metabolism modulating phosphorylation states glycogen phosphorylase glycogen synthase, ultimately increased hepatic glycogen content. Enhanced glucokinase reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression, together increased plasma triglycerides, indicate improved glycolysis. consequence insulin-mimetic effects glycogen metabolism, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, liver-specific inhibition SHIP2 improved glucose tolerance markedly reduced prandial blood glucose levels KKA(y) mice. results support attractiveness specific inhibition SHIP2 prevention and/or treatment type 2 diabetes.
