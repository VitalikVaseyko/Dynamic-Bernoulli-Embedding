 Altered cellular metabolism plays important role many diseases, least many forms cancer, cellular metabolic pathways requiring lower oxygen consumption often favored (the so-called Warburg effect). work, applied fluorescence-based transient state imaging exploited environment sensitivity long-lived dark states fluorophores, particular triplet state decay rates, image oxygen consumption living cells. measurements resolve differences oxygen concentrations different regions individual cells, different cell types, also based metabolic pathways cells use. MCF-7 breast cancer cells, higher oxygen consumption detected rely glutamine instead glucose main metabolite, predominantly undergoing oxidative phosphorylation rather glycolysis. use high triplet yield dye Eosin irradiance requirements measurements kept low. reduces instrumentation requirements, harmful biological effects high excitation doses avoided. Taken together, imaging approach widely applicable capable detecting subtle changes oxygen consumption live cells, stemming Warburg effect reflecting differences cellular metabolism. may lead new diagnostic means well advance understanding interplay cellular metabolism major disease categories, cancer.
