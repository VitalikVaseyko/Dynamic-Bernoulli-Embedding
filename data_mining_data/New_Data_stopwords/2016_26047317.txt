 Ablation glycosylated lysosomal membrane protein (GLMP, formerly known NCU-G1) shown cause chronic liver injury progresses liver fibrosis mice. lysosomal dysfunction chronic liver injury cause metabolic dysregulation. Glmp gt/gt mice (formerly known Ncu-g1gt/gt mice) studied 3 weeks 9 months age. Body weight gain feed efficiency Glmp gt/gt mice comparable wild type siblings, age 9 months Glmp gt/gt siblings significantly reduced body weight. Reduced size epididymal fat pads accompanied hepatosplenomegaly Glmp gt/gt mice. Blood analysis revealed reduced levels blood glucose, circulating triacylglycerol non-esterified fatty acids Glmp gt/gt mice. Increased flux glucose, increased de novo lipogenesis lipid accumulation detected Glmp gt/gt primary hepatocytes, well elevated triacylglycerol levels Glmp gt/gt liver homogenates, compared hepatocytes liver wild type mice. Gene expression analysis showed increased expression genes involved fatty acid uptake lipogenesis Glmp gt/gt liver compared wild type. findings agreement metabolic alterations observed mouse models lacking lysosomal proteins, alterations characteristic advanced chronic liver injury.
