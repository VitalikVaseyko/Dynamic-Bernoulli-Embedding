 Incubation boar sperm fresh ejaculates minimal medium 10 mM glucose induced fast intense activation glycolysis, indicated observed increases intracellular levels glucose 6-phosphate (G 6-P) ATP rate formation extracellular L-lactate. effect glucose much intense induced fructose, sorbitol, mannose. greater utilization glucose related much greater sensitivity hexokinase compared monosaccharides. Thus, presence 0.5 mM glucose induced total hexokinase activity supernatants sperm extracts 1.7 +/- 0.1 mIU/mg protein, concentration fructose, mannose, sorbitol induced total hexokinase activity 0.3 +/- 0.1 mIU/mg protein 0.60 +/- 1 mIU/mg protein. Kinetic analysis total pyruvate kinase activity indicated activity greatly dependent presence ADP also showed great affinity PEP, estimated Km supernatants 0.15-0.20 mM. Immunological location proteins closely related glycolysis, like GLUT-3 hexose transporter hexokinase-I, indicated proteins showed trend distributed around cellular membranes head midpiece grouped manner. conclude glycolysis regulated specific availability concrete sugar internal equilibrium ATP ADP levels. Furthermore, localization proteins involved control monosaccharide uptake phosphorylation suggests glycolysis starts concrete points boar-sperm surface.
