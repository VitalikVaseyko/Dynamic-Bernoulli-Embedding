 Berberine (BBR) potentially used drug non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diabetes. previous study found BBR could change pattern DNA methylation. mechanisms underlying berberine still far completely understood. study, function L-PK cell metabolism explored, high-fat-diet induced SD rats NAFLD models created. NAFLD rats randomly grouped oral administration BBR dosage 200 mg/kg daily. DNA methylation histone acetylation around L-type Pyruvate Kinase (L-PK) gene examined. results, found L-PK positive effect cell proliferation, glucose utilization triglyceride metabolism. However, expression L-PK reduced livers NAFLD rats, accord decrease DNA hypermethylation histone deacetylation regulatory regions L-PK. Notably, BBR treatment restore expression L-PK demethylation L-PK promoter increase acetylation levels histone H3 H4 around L-PK, indicated BBR may potential drug epigenetic-included diseases.
