 1. Many clinical studies suggested relationship oestrogen insulin sensitivity. present study, HepG2 cells divided four groups: (i) control, incubated 1 nmol/L insulin; (ii) HI group, incubated 100 nmol/L insulin induce insulin resistance; (iii) E2 group, control cells incubated 1 nmol/L insulin plus 1 nmol/L oestradiol; (iv) HI + E2 group, insulin-resistant cells incubated 100 nmol/L insulin + 1 nmol/L oestradiol. 2. high concentration insulin decreased activity phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) glycogen synthase (GS), well decreasing expression insulin receptor (IR) insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2). High insulin effect glucose transport expression insulin receptor-1 (IRS-1). 3. addition oestradiol control cells increased glucose transport, activity PFK, PDH GS expression IRS-1 IRS-2, effect expression IR. 4. Treatment insulin-resistant HepG2 cells oestradiol attenuated HI-induced decreases, except IR, expression IRS-1 significantly higher control, attaining levels seen group 3. expression IRS-2 significant higher insulin-resistant cells, reach control levels. Changes activity PFK, PDH GS changes seen expression IRS-2. 5. results suggest high concentrations insulin induce insulin resistance HepG2 cells, whereas oestradiol improves glucose metabolism insulin signal transduction cells enhancing activity key enzymes involved glucose metabolism expression IRS-1 IRS-2.
