 Nine enzyme activity variants liver/erythrocyte pyruvate kinase found amongst laboratory wild mice. Four variants shown biochemical immunological criteria mutations structural gene, Pk-1s. four structural gene mutations, two regulatory gene mutations, define gene complex, [Pk-1]. One allele structural gene, Pk-1sl, found inbred strain C57BL, unusual phenotype affects expression pyruvate kinase liver erythrocyte. possible mechanism tissue-specific structural gene mutation suggested.
