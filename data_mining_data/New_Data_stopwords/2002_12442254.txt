 Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) common genetic cause human mental retardation. Down's syndrome (DS) patients, deteriorated glucose, lipid, purine, folate methionine/homocysteine metabolism reported. study, used proteomic approach evaluate protein expression enzyme proteins intermediary metabolism brain Down's syndrome fetuses. fetal DS brain, detected increased protein levels mitochondrial aconitase well NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, decreased protein expression citrate synthase cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. two spots corresponded either pyruvate kinase M1 M2 isozymes, significant elevation observed one, second spot well sum spots showed differences DS controls. results suggest derangement intermediary metabolism prenatal development DS individuals.
