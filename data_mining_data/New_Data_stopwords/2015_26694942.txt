 Reprogrammed glucose metabolism emerging hallmark cancer cells, show unique metabolic phenotype known Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), key enzyme glycolytic process, executes final step conversion lactate pyruvate. However, little known roles LDHA human glioblastoma (GBM). study, aimed determine effects LDHA elucidate related underlying mechanisms. Data derived Oncomine database showed LDHA commonly upregulated GBM tissues comparison corresponding normal controls. Silencing LDHA expression resulted reduced glycolysis, decreased cell growth, increased cell apoptosis, attenuated invasive ability. presence 2-deoxyglucose, glycolysis inhibitor, oncogenic activities LDHA completely blocked. findings provide evidence cellular functions LDHA progression GBM suggest LDHA might act potential therapeutic target GBM treatment.
