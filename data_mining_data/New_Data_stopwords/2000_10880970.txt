 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) specific activity increased 250% following 8 10 days Pi starvation Brassica napus suspension cells. Densitometric scanning PEPC immunoblots revealed close correlation PEPC activity amount antigenic 104-kDa PEPC subunit. assess influence Pi deprivation PEPC, enzyme purified Pi-sufficient (+Pi) Pi-starved (-Pi) cells electrophoretic homogeneity final specific activities 37-40 micromol phosphoenolpyruvate utilized per min per mg protein. Gel filtration, SDS/PAGE, CNBr peptide mapping indicated +Pi -Pi PEPCs homotetramers composed identical 104-kDa subunit. Respective pH-activity profiles, phosphoenolpyruvate saturation kinetics, sensitivity L-malate inhibition also indistinguishable. Kinetic studies phosphatase treatments revealed PEPC +Pi -Pi cells exists mainly dephosphorylated (L-malate sensitive) form. Thus, up-regulation PEPC activity -Pi cells appears solely due accumulation PEPC isoform expressed +Pi cells. PEPC activity modulated several metabolites involved carbon nitrogen metabolism. pH 7.3, marked activation glucose 6-phosphate inhibition L-malate, L-aspartate, L-glutamate, DL-isocitrate, rutin quercetin observed. following paper provides model coordinate regulation B. napus PEPC cytosolic pyruvate kinase allosteric effectors. L-Aspartate L-glutamate appear play crucial role control phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint B. napus, particularly respect integration carbohydrate partitioning generation carbon skeletons required nitrogen assimilation.
