 shown previously fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene expression positively regulated glucose rat adipose tissue liver. present study, identified first intron gene sequence closely related known glucose-responsive elements L-pyruvate kinase S14 genes, including putative upstream stimulatory factor/major late transcription factor (USF/MLTF) binding site (E-box) (+ 292 nt + 297 nt). Location sequence corresponds site hypersensitivity DNase present liver spleen. Moreover, using information preliminary report present work, others shown + 283 nt + 303 nt sequence FAS gene confer glucose responsiveness heterologous promoter. protein binding region investigated vitro combination DNase footprinting gel-retardation experiments synthetic oligonucleotides known nuclear proteins. DNase footprinting experiments using + 161 nt + 405 nt fragment FAS gene demonstrate region + 290 nt + 316 nt protected nuclear extracts liver spleen. region binds two ubiquitous nuclear factors, USF/MLTF CAAT-binding transcription factor/nuclear factor 1 (CTF/NF1). Binding factors similar nuclear extracts liver express FAS gene observed glucose-responsive elements L-pyruvate kinase S14 genes. suggests posttranslational modification factor complex glucose stimulation.
