 manual modification automated method [Atkinson, K. F., Clin. Chem. 18, 1001 (1972)] enzymatic assay 2,3-diphosphoglycerate described, suitable small laboratories. Samples easily prepared analysis, preparations stable several months. Virtually color generated colorimetric assay produced diphosphoglycerate-catalyzed reaction. coefficient variation multiple samples single subject 2.4%. Delayed preparation samples, particularly samples acidotic subjects, shown result altered results. enzyme method compared analysis ion-exchange chromatography.
