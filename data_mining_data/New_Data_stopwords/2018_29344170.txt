 Abnormal glucose metabolism critical colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Expression pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 isoform, rather PKM1 isoform, serves important functions reprogramming glucose metabolism cancer cells. Preferential expression PKM2 primarily driven alternative splicing, coordinated group splicing factors including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)A1, hnRNPA2 RNA binding motif containing. However, underlying molecular mechanisms associated cancer cell expression PKM2, instead PKM1, remain unknown. mRNA levels PKM isoform glucose metabolism analyzed CRC cells. results present study indicated S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) promotes glycolysis growth CRC cells regulating alternative splicing PKM gene. addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated S6K2 phosphorylation Ser(6) hnRNPA1 facilitated hnRNPA1 binding splicing site PKM gene. result, cancer cells preferentially expressed PKM2 isoform, instead PKM1 isoform. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis demonstrated phosphorylation Ser(6) hnRNPA1 predictor poor prognosis patients CRC. Therefore, results present study revealed phosphorylation Ser(6) hnRNPA1 S6K2 novel mechanism underlying glucose metabolic reprogramming, suggested S6K2 potential therapeutic target CRC treatment.
