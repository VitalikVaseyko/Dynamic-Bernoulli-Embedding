 Concentrations glycolytic intermediates, amino acids possible regulator substances measured extracts locust thoracic muscles perfused different conditions. conversion [(14)C]glucose intermediates CO(2) muscle preparations also followed. muscles perfused glucose made anaerobic changes metabolite concentrations occurred could accounted activation phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase. butyrate glucose present perfusion medium rate glycolytic flux lower glucose alone, aldolase reaction appeared inhibited. butyrate alone supplied muscle concentrations glycolytic intermediates similar found glucose supplied. Iodoacetate caused changes concentrations intermediates appeared result inhibition glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Fluoroacetate-poisoned muscles showed high citrate concentration, obvious site inhibition citrate apparent glycolytic pathway. Mechanisms control glycolysis locust flight muscle discussed related known properties isolated enzymes. proposed trehalase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase may control enzymes tissue.
