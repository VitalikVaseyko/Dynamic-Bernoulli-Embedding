 OBJECTIVE: aim study verify whether changes PDK4 mRNA expression skeletal muscle formerly obese subjects underwent malabsorptive bariatric surgery [bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD)] might related insulin sensitivity improvement, possible modifications might correlate reduction intramyocytic lipid level. RESEARCH METHODS PROCEDURES: Six obese women (body mass index 46.6 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2)) enrolled study. Body composition, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp muscle biopsies skeletal muscle lipid analysis, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed 3 years BPD. RESULTS: average weight loss observed surgery approximately 42%. Increased glucose uptake accompanied significant decrease PDK4 mRNA (R(2) = 0.71, p < 0.001). amounts intramyocytic triglycerides correlate directly PDK4 mRNA (R(2) = 0.87, p = 0.005) inversely glucose uptake values (R(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: results support concept reduced tissue availability fatty acids consequent massive lipid malabsorption influences glucose metabolism acting regulation PDH complex. fact, shown animals, higher level FFA availability likely induce overexpression PDK4 also humans.
