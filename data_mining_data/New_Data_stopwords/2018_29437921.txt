 expansion genetic repertoire organism gene duplication horizontal gene transfer (HGT) aid adaptation. Streptomyces bacteria prolific producers bioactive specialized metabolites adaptive functions nature found extensive utility human medicine. biosynthesis specialized metabolites directed dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters, little attention focused organisms evolved robustness genomes facilitate metabolic plasticity required provide chemical precursors biosynthesis complex metabolic transitions vegetative growth specialized metabolite production sporulation. Here, examine genetic redundancy actinobacteria show specialized metabolite-producing bacterial families exhibit gene family expansion primary metabolism. Focusing gene duplication event, show two pyruvate kinases genome Streptomyces coelicolor arose ancient duplication event evolved altered enzymatic kinetics, Pyk1 20-fold-higher kcat Pyk2 (4,703 s(-1) compared 215 s(-1), respectively), yet constitutively expressed. pyruvate kinase mutants also found compromised terms fitness compared wild-type Streptomyces data suggest expanding gene families help maintain cell functionality metabolic perturbation nutrient limitation and/or specialized metabolite production.IMPORTANCE rise antimicrobial-resistant infections prompted resurgence interest understanding production specialized metabolites, antibiotics, Streptomyces presence multiple genes encoding enzymatic function aspect Streptomyces biology received little attention; however, understanding metabolic expansion influences organisms help enhance production clinically useful molecules. Here, show expanding number pyruvate kinases enables metabolic adaptation, increases strain fitness, represents excellent target metabolic engineering industrial specialized metabolite-producing bacteria activation cryptic specialized metabolites.
