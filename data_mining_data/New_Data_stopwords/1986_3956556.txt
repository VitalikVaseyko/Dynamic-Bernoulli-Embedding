 Primary breast cancers 85 patients undergoing post-surgical adjuvant chemotherapy analyzed five glycolytic enzymes: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); phosphohexose isomerase (PHI); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD); pyruvate-kinase (PK); 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD). purpose study determine whether biochemical parameters could offer prognostic index determine outcome therapy. patients followed maximum 54 months; period 30 developed recurrent metastatic disease. enzyme activities expressed three following reference parameters: units/g proteins, units/g tissue weight units/mg DNA. Two methods analysis compared: firstly, univariate analysis using life tables; secondly, multivariate analysis using Cox's model, enzyme levels tested mode expression addition node status, histological features, receptor menopausal status. Life table analyses appear limited subsets patients studied sample size tends become small warrant firm conclusions. Using Cox's model, prognostic index 1 proposed, including number involved nodes product logarithms G-6PD 6-PGD expressed units/mg DNA. Compared number involved nodes, index gives slightly better discrimination patients 2 yr mastectomy.
