 basis experimentally determined kinetic properties trypanosomal enzymes, question addressed step limits glycolytic flux bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. appeared single answer; physiological range, control shifted glucose transporter one hand aldolase (ALD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) hand. kinases, often thought control glycolysis, exerted little control; utilization ATP. identified potential targets anti-trypanosomal drugs calculating steps need least inhibition achieve certain inhibition glycolytic flux parasites. glucose transporter appeared promising target, followed ALD, GDH, GAPDH, PGK. contrast, erythrocytes 95% deficiencies PGK, GAPDH, ALD cause clinical symptoms (Schuster, R. Holzhutter, H.-G. (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 229, 403-418). Therefore, selectivity drugs inhibiting enzymes may much higher expected molecular effects alone. Quite unexpectedly, trypanosomes seem possess substantial overcapacity hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, making "irreversible" enzymes mediocre drug targets.
