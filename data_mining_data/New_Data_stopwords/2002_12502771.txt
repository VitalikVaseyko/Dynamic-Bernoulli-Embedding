 study evaluated link swimming endurance condition Atlantic cod Gadus morhua fed starved 16 weeks preceding tests, assessed whether muscle metabolic capacities explain links. condition factor [(somatic mass x fork length(-3))x100] starved cod 0.54+/-0.1 whereas fed cod 0.81+/-0.1. white red muscle, measured four glycolytic enzymes: phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine kinase (CK) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), two mitochondrial enzymes: cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) citrate synthase (CS), biosynthetic enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), glycogen protein levels water content. Muscle samples taken three positions along length fish; starvation affected metabolic capacities white muscle red muscle. levels glycolytic enzymes glycogen changed white red muscle starvation. fed starved cod, muscle metabolic capacities varied position along fish; starvation reduced longitudinal variation white red muscle. white muscle fed cod, glycolytic enzyme levels increased head tail, starved cod longitudinal variation disappeared. red muscle mitochondrial enzyme levels highest caudal sample, fewer differences found glycolytic enzymes. Swimming endurance markedly affected fish condition, starved fish swimming 30% time (and distance) fed fish. endurance closely linked number burst-coast movements test activity CCO LDH white muscle. number burst-coast movements significantly linked condition factor PFK activity caudal red muscle gill arch mass. data indicated cod use glycolytic oxidative capacities support endurance swimming. Furthermore, swimming endurance linked metabolic capacities red white muscle.
