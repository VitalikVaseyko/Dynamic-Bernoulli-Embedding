 addition enzyme control intensity determined pacemaker enzymes hexokinase phosphofructokinase, well glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase pyruvate kinase control intensity almost 0 ultrasonic hemolysates erythrocyte concentrate. hemolysate approximately reflects conditions existing intact cell regard glycolytic rate, ATP supply, metabolite concentration. therefore suitable cell model, excluding membrane, studying inner control factors. HK, PFK, GAPD, PK predictions based linear glycolytic model significance enzymes regulation glycolytic rate could confirmed.
