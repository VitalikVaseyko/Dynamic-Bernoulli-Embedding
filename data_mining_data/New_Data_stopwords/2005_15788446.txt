 role hepatic nitric oxide (NO) liver regeneration partial hepatectomy (PH) studied animals carrying nitric oxide synthase-2 transgene control phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase promoter. mice expressed NOS-2 liver cells fasting conditions. Liver mass recovery molecular parameters related cell proliferation determined PH. Preexisting hepatic synthesis, well delivery NO-donors, impaired early signaling (for example, attenuated NF-kappaB activation TNF-alpha IL-6 release). regenerative process also impaired result insufficient proliferative response, mouse survival surgery compromised. However, exerted protective role apoptosis transgenic hepatectomized mice. Local production liver cells, achieved hydrodynamic-based transfection NOS-2-encoding plasmid, also resulted delayed liver recovery PH also protected Fas-mediated apoptosis. data show sustained presence PH exerts dual role: attenuating liver regeneration efficiently protecting liver apoptosis.
