 pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (PDC) rate limiting glucose oxidation heart. Inhibition PDC end-product feedback phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) operate concert inhibit PDC activity. transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha increases PDK expression tissues, examined role PPAR-alpha regulating glucose oxidation hearts mice overexpressing PPAR-alpha (MHC-PPAR-alpha mice). Glucose oxidation rates decreased isolated working hearts MHC-PPAR-alpha mice compared wild-type littermates (428 +/- 113 vs. 771 +/- 63 nmol x g dry weight-1x min-1, respectively), accompanied parallel increase fatty acid oxidation. However, difference PDC activity MHC-PPAR-alpha wild-type animals, even though expression PDK isoform PDK1 increased MHC-PPAR-alpha mice. Glucose oxidation rates MHC-PPAR-alpha wild-type mouse hearts decreased 48-h fasting (which increases PPAR-alpha expression) treatment mice PPAR-alpha agonist WY-14,643 1 wk. Despite this, PDC activity animal groups altered. Taken together, data suggest glucose oxidation rates heart dramatically altered independent PDK phosphorylation inhibition PDC PDK. also suggests PPAR-alpha activation decreases glucose oxidation hearts mainly decreasing flux pyruvate PDC due negative feedback PDC fatty acid oxidation reaction products rather phosphorylated state PDC complex.
