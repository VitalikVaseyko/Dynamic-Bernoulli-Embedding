 Production lactate even presence sufficient levels oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) seems prevalent energy metabolism pathway cancer cells. analysis altered expression effectors causing redirection glucose metabolism would help characterize phenomenon possible therapeutic implications. analyzed mRNA expression key enzymes involved aerobic glycolysis normal mucosa (NM), primary tumor (PT) liver metastasis (LM) colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pts) underwent primary tumor surgery liver metastasectomy. Tissues 48 CRC pts analyzed RT-qPCR mRNA expression following genes: hexokinase-1 (HK-1) 2 (HK-2), embryonic pyruvate kinase (PKM-2), lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A), glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-1 (VDAC-1). Differences expression candidate genes tissues associations clinical/pathologic features studied. GLUT-1, LDH-A, HK-1, PKM-2 VDAC-1 mRNA expression levels significantly higher PT/LM tissues compared NM. trend higher expression genes LM compared PT tissues, differences statistically significant LDH-A expression only. RAS mutation-positive disease associated high GLUT-1 mRNA expression levels only. Right-sided colon tumors showed significantly higher GLUT-1, PKM-2 LDH-A mRNA expression levels. High glycolytic profile significantly associated poor prognosis 20 metastatic, RAS-mutated pts treated first-line chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab. Altered expression effectors associated upregulated glucose uptake aerobic glycolysis occurs CRC tissues. Additional analyses warranted addressing role changes anti-angiogenic resistance developing novel therapeutics.
