 glucose-induced insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells, population insulin granules fuses plasma membrane without typical docking process (newcomer granule fusions), however, mechanism unclear. study, investigated PI3K signaling pathways involved upregulation newcomer granule fusions. Acute treatment class IA-selective PI3K inhibitors, PIK-75 PI-103, enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion. Total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy revealed PI3K inhibitors increased fusion events newcomer granules. developed new system transfection pancreatic islets demonstrated usefulness system order evaluating effect transfected genes glucose-induced secretion primary cultured pancreatic islets. Using transfection system together series constitutive active mutants, showed PI3K-3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)-Akt pathway mediated potentiation insulin secretion. Akt inhibitor also enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion parallel upregulation newcomer granule fusions, probably via increased motility intracellular insulin granules. data suggest PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway plays significant role newcomer granule fusions, probably alteration dynamics intracellular insulin granules.
