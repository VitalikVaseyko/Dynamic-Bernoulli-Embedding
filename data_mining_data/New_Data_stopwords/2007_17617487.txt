 Cofactor engineering, defined purposeful modification pool intracellular cofactors, demonstrated suitable strategy improvement L(-)-carnitine production Escherichia coli strains. overexpression CaiB (CoA-transferase) CaiC (CoA-ligase), enzymes involved coenzyme transfer substrate activation bioprocess, led increase L(-)-carnitine production. optimal concentrations inducer fumarate (used electron acceptors) yields reached 10- 50-fold, respectively, obtained wild type strain. However, low levels coenzyme limited activity two enzymes since addition pantothenate increased production. Growth substrates whose assimilation yields acetyl-CoA (such acetate pyruvate) inhibited L(-)-carnitine production. Interestingly, control steps metabolism acetyl-CoA E. coli detected. glyoxylate shunt anaplerotic pathways limit bioprocess since strains carrying deletions isocitrate lyase isocitrate dehydrogenase phosphatase/kinase yielded 20-25% L(-)-carnitine control. hand, deletion phosphotransacetylase strongly inhibited bioprocess, suggesting adequate flux acetyl-CoA connection phosphoenolpyruvate-glyoxylate cycle together acetate metabolism crucial biotransformation.
