 mutant form pyruvate kinase serine 384 mutated proline engineered yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Residue 384 located helix subunit interface tetrameric enzyme, mutation anticipated alter conformation helix hence destabilize interface. Previous results indicate mutant favours quaternary conformation R conformation, confirmed results presented here. Addition phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP), ADP fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (Fru-1.6-P2) singly wild-type mutant enzymes results significant quenching tryptophan fluorescence (12-44%), Fru-1,6-P2, red shift 15 nm emission maximum. Fluorescence titration experiments showed PEP, ADP Fru-1,6-P2 induce conformations similar ligand-binding properties wild-type mutant enzymes. However, Fru-1,6-P2 induced conformation demonstrably different induced either ADP PEP. enzymes differ susceptibility trypsin digestion N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. thermal stability enzyme unaltered mutation. Far-UV CD spectra show enzymes adopt similar overall secondary structure solution. Taken together, results suggest Ser384-Pro mutation causes enzyme adopt different tertiary and/or quaternary structure wild-type enzyme affects type extent conformational changes induced enzyme upon ligand binding. simplified minimal reaction mechanism proposed R states differ affinity kcat. Thus, terms models cooperativity allosteric interaction, pyruvate kinase K V system.
