 Established epithelial cell lines derived livers 7-day (B, B-R, B-3-4-7, J-C-1, J-C-13, J-5-2-1, E-C-4 E-C-7) adult (AL-2, AL-3, AL-4, AL-5 AL-6) rats analyzed hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) fructose 1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase). None cell lines showed appreciable activities adult type liver enzymes (HK Type IVs (glucokinase), PK Type L, G6Pase FDPase). contrary, activities fetal type liver enzymes (HK Types II, PK Type M2 G6PD) increased markedly compared dispersed cells tissues adult liver. 6PGD gave minimum changes activity, 6PGD/G6PD ratio decreased consistently. HK Type III found J-C-13, AL-5 AL-6, HK Type IVf (high Km) present cell lines examined. Possible explanations undifferentiated patterns carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes established cell lines, several evidence hepatocyte origin, presented.
