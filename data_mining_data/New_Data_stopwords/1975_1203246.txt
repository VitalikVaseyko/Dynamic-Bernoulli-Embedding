 1. Homogenates rat epididymal fat pad, heart, kidney, lactating mammary gland, liver, skeletal muscle small intestinal mucosa partitioned particulate supernatant fraction. reliable marker enzymes mitochondrial matrix cytosol: propionyl-CoA carboxylase pyruvate kinase, distributions acyl-CoA synthetase activities measured 1 10 mM C2, C3 C4 mitochondria cytosol calculated. values estimate made K0.5 fatty acids. 2. distinct fatty acid-activating enzyme assumed present one compartments fatty acid activated K0.5 less equal 1.5 mM amount greater 13% total cellular activity. Adipose tissue, gut, liver mammary gland, organs high lipogenetic capacity, contained cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase. 1 mM acetate 60, 31, 77 83% total cellular activities organs cytosolic nature, activities 0.021, 0.32, 0.37 1.16 mumol C2 activated per min per g wet weight, respectively. 3. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA butyryl-CoA synthetases found adipose tissue, gut, heart, kidney, mammary gland muscle. absent liver. Adipose tissue liver contained mitochondrial propionyl-CoA synthetase activities 1 mM C3 0.014 1.50 mumol C3 activated per min per g wet weight, respectively. 4. 1 mM, C2 activated decreasing rates kidney, heart, mammary gland gut (7.6-1.0 mumol C2 activated per min per g wet weight). C3 (1 mM) activation equal (1.6-1.9 mumol C3 activated per min per g wet weight) liver, kidney heart. C4 (1 mM) activated decreasing rates heart, liver, kidney gut (4.0-0.5 mumol C4 activated per min per g wet weight) order given. 5. influence isolation method diet fatty acid activation small intestinal mucosal scrapings studied. demonstrate existence cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase fed animals pre-treatment everted intestine low amplitude vibration found essential. Also C16 activation highly (95%) decreased non-pre-vibrated preparation. 24 h starvation lowered cytosolic C2 total C16 activation 90 80%, respectively. Refeeding starved rats balanced fat-free diet, sucrose only, gave cytosolic C2 total C16 activation normally fed rats. 6. guienea-pig heart, kidney, liver muscle partitions found respective rat organs. acetate activation liver factor 6 lower. Acetate butyrate activation guinea-pig muscle much higher (6 37 times, respectively).
