 Impaired glucose homeostasis one risk factors causing metabolic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancers. glucose metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) mediates major regulatory step, irreversible reaction oxidative decarboxylation pyruvate acetyl-CoA. Tight control PDC critical plays key role glucose disposal. PDC activity tightly regulated using phosphorylation pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1 4) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP1 2). PDKs PDPs exhibit unique tissue expression patterns, kinetic properties, sensitivities regulatory molecules. last decades, up-regulation PDKs observed tissues patients mammals metabolic diseases, suggests inhibition kinases may beneficial effects treating metabolic diseases. review summarizes recent advances role specific PDK isoenzymes induction metabolic diseases describes effects PDK inhibition prevention metabolic diseases using pharmacological inhibitors. Based reports, PDK isoenzymes strong therapeutic targets preventing treating metabolic diseases.
