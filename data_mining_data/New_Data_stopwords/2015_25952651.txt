 Kidney cancer [or renal cell carcinoma (RCC)] known "the internist's tumor" protean systemic manifestations, suggesting utilizes complex, nonphysiologic metabolic pathways. Given increasing incidence cancer lack effective therapeutic targets, undertook extensive analysis human RCC tissue employing combined grade-dependent proteomics metabolomics analysis determine metabolic reprogramming occurring disease allows escape available therapeutic approaches. validation experiments RCC cell lines wild-type mutant Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, characterizing higher-grade tumors, found Warburg effect relatively prominent expense tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative metabolism general. Further, found glutamine metabolism pathway acts inhibit reactive oxygen species, evidenced upregulated glutathione pathway, whereas beta-oxidation pathway inhibited, leading increased fatty acylcarnitines. support findings previous urine metabolomics analyses, also documented tryptophan catabolism associated immune suppression, highly represented RCC compared metabolic pathways. Together, results offer rationale evaluate novel antimetabolic treatment strategies developed disease settings therapeutic strategies RCC.
