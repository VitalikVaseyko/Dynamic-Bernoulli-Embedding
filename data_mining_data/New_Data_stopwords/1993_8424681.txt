 Using phosphocellulose affinity chromatography able separate two pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activities parasitic protozoan Leishmania mexicana amazonesis. One activity (PYK1) showed hyperbolic kinetics decreased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, whereas second activity (PYK2) showed sigmoidal kinetics substrate phosphoenolpyruvate activated fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Molecular sieve chromatography (Sephacryl S-400) PYK1 produced single peak apparent molecular mass around 200,000, PYK2 eluted position corresponding M(r) 55,000.
