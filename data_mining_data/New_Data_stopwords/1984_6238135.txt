 investigate sex differences organization enzyme activities energy supplying metabolism skeletal muscle, samples vastus lateralis extracted active untrained males (n = 16) females (n = 17), ranging age 18 22 years. Muscle tissue 2 different biopsy samples subject analyzed enzymes representative citric acid cycle (succinic dehydrogenase, SDH), beta-oxidation fatty acids (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HAD), glycogenolysis (phosphorylase, PHOSPH), glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, PK; phosphofructokinase, PFK lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase, HK). results indicated maximal activities PFK, PK, LDH PHOSPH, HK SDH averaged 15 32% higher males females. significant differences sexes found HAD. enzyme activity ratios calculated, sex differences evident HAD/SDH ratio (mean +/- SD; females = 0.56 +/- 0.20; males = 0.41 +/- 0.11 PFK/HAD ratio (females = 7.40 +/- 1.6; males = 9.58 +/- 1.9). findings suggest (1) females significantly lower overall capacity aerobic oxidation anaerobic glycolysis males; (2) females greater capacity beta-oxidation relative capacity citric acid cycle; (3) glycolytic potential relative potential beta-oxidation lower females.
