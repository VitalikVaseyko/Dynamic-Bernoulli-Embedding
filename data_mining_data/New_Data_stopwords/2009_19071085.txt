 examined HepG2 cells whether glucose-induced changes AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity could mediated SIRT1, NAD(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylase linked increase longevity caused caloric restriction. Incubation 25 vs. 5mM glucose 6h concurrently diminished phosphorylation AMPK (Thr 172) ACC (Ser 79), increased lactate release, decreased abundance activity SIRT1. contrast, incubation pyruvate (0.1 1mM) 2h increased AMPK phosphorylation SIRT1 abundance activity. putative SIRT1 activators resveratrol quercetin also increased AMPK phosphorylation. None tested compounds (low high glucose, pyruvate, resveratrol) significantly altered AMP/ATP ratio. Collectively, findings raise possibility glucose-induced changes AMPK linked alterations SIRT1 abundance activity possibly cellular redox state.
