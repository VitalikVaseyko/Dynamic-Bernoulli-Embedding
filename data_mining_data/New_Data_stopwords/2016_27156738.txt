 better understanding interactions among intestinal microbes needed decipher complex cross talk takes place within human gut. Bacteroides Bifidobacterium genera among relevant intestinal bacteria, previously reported coculturing 2 microorganisms affects survival. Therefore, coculturing Bifidobacterium longum NB667 Bacteroides fragilis DSMZ2151 performed aim unravelling mechanisms involved interaction. end, applied proteomic (2D-DIGE) analyses, chromatographic techniques quantified bacterial metabolites produced coincubation. Coculture stimulated growth B. longum, retarding B. fragilis, concomitant changes production proteins metabolites bacteria. combined culture promoted upregulation bifidobacterial pyruvate kinase downregulation Bacteroides phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase - 2 enzymes involved catabolism carbohydrates. Moreover, B. fragilis FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, protein chaperone-like activity, found overproduced coculture, suggesting induction stress response microorganism. study provides mechanistic data deepen understanding interaction Bacteroides Bifidobacterium intestinal populations.
