 developed technique utilizes matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry study subunit association proteins. Aqueous protein samples treated dilute solution glutaraldehyde, cross-linking agent reacts free amino groups proteins. agent effectively traps multimeric form, preventing dissociating sample preparation desorption process. Proteins measured include lysozyme, carbonic anhydrase, apomyoglobin, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ovine lutropin, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, avidin pyruvate kinase. Dimeric tetrameric complexes 250,000 Da measured manner.
