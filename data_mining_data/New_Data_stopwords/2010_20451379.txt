 Cancer cells distinct metabolic needs different normal cells exploited development anti-cancer therapeutics. Activation tumor specific M2 form pyruvate kinase (PKM2) potential strategy returning cancer cells metabolic state characteristic normal cells. Here, describe activators PKM2 based upon substituted thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole[3,2-d]pyridazinone scaffold. synthesis agents, structure-activity relationships, analysis activity related targets (PKM1, PKR PKL) examination aqueous solubility investigated. agents represent second reported chemotype activation PKM2.
