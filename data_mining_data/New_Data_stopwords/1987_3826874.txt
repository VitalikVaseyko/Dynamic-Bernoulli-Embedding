 Samples blood collected (by jugular venipuncture) 10 homozygote halothane-reacting pigs 7 homozygote nonreactors. Antioxidant status assessed measurement blood glutathione peroxidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase activities plasma concentrations vitamin E. Significant differences values apparent halothane-reacting pigs nonreactors. Halothane-reacting pigs tissue damage indicated significantly increased plasma activities enzymes creatine kinase pyruvate kinase. latter showed better discrimination 2 populations creatine kinase could prove effective marker identification stress-susceptible pigs.
