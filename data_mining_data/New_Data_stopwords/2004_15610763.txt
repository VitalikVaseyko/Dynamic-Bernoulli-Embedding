 development age-related proliferative disorders prostate gland supported transdifferentiation cellular senescence processes stroma. processes involved remodeling stromal tissue, observed benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), "reactive stroma" adjacent prostate cancer (PCa). assumed TGF-beta1 plays key role aging prostate inducing premature senescence favoring myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, evaluated stromal cell phenotypes human primary adult prostatic fibroblasts (n=3) molecular cellular mechanisms growth arrest treatment TGF-beta1 vitro cellular senescence. Microarray analysis, quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence western blot revealed cellular senescence transdifferentiation fibroblasts distinct underlying mechanisms, pathways gene protein expression profiles human PrSCs. clear contrast senescent cells, TGF-beta1-treated cells morphologically transdifferentiated myofibroblasts dense cytoskeletal fibers increased expression smooth muscle cell alpha-actin, calponin tenascin. TGF-beta1 induced neither expression senescence-associated markers genes involved terminal growth arrest, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p16(Ink4A) p21(Cip1) increased p15(Ink4B) protein expression. Differentiation inhibitor (Id-1) protein level down-regulation observed conditions. Genes specifically up-regulated transdifferentiation cellular senescence PrSCs metalloproteinase 1 tissue inhibitor (Timp1), transgelin (Tagln), gamma 2 actin (Actg2), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (Serpinel), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), parathyroid hormone-like hormone (Pthlp), Tgfb-1, four half LIM domains 2 (Fhl-2), hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic5) cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Comp). genes, Cdc28 protein kinase 1 (Cks1b), v-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MybL2), pyruvate kinase, muscle 2 (Pkm2) Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), down-regulated upon TGF-beta1 treatment cellular senescence. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (Pdk3) connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) up-regulated hyaluronan synthase 3 (Has3) down-regulated conditions. Moreover, GageC1, prostate/testis-specific protein overexpressed symptomatic BPH PCa induced transdifferentiated stromal cells. Genes GageC1 could promising targets therapeutic inhibitors stromal tissue remodeling progression BPH PCa.
