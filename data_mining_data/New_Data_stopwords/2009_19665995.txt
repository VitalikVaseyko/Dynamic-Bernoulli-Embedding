 Curcumin, bioactive component curry spice turmeric, related structures possess potent anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory properties. Several lines evidence suggest curcumin may play beneficial role animal models diabetes, lowering blood glucose levels ameliorating long-term complications diabetes. However, current understanding mechanism curcumin action rudimentary limited anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory effects. study examine potential anti-diabetic mechanisms curcumin, curcumin C3 complex), tetrahydrocurcuminoids (THC). Curcuminoids exert direct effect receptor tyrosine kinase activity, 2-deoxy glucose uptake L6-GLUT4myc cells, intestinal glucose metabolism measured DPP4/alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. demonstrate curcuminoids effectively suppressed dexamethasone-induced phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK) glucose6-phosphatase (G6Pase) H4IIE rat hepatoma Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Furthermore, curcuminoids increased phosphorylation AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) H4IIE Hep3B cells 400 times (curcumin) 100,000 times (THC) potency metformin. results suggest AMPK mediated suppression hepatic gluconeogenesis may potential mechanism mediating glucose-lowering effects curcuminoids.
