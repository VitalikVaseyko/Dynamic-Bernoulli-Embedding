 resistance polylactide biodegradation physical properties polymer controlled adjusting ratio L-lactic acid D-lactic acid. Although largest demand L enantiomer, substantial amounts enantiomers required bioplastics. constructed derivatives Escherichia coli W3110 (prototrophic) new biocatalysts production D-lactic acid. strains (SZ40, SZ58, SZ63) require mineral salts nutrients lack plasmids antibiotic resistance genes used construction. D-Lactic acid production new strains approached theoretical maximum yield two molecules per glucose molecule. chemical purity D-lactic acid approximately 98% respect soluble organic compounds. optical purity exceeded 99%. Competing pathways eliminated chromosomal inactivation genes encoding fumarate reductase (frdABCD), alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhE), pyruvate formate lyase (pflB). cell yield lactate productivity increased mutation acetate kinase gene (ackA). Similar improvements could achieved addition 10 mM acetate initial period aeration. three approaches reduced time required complete fermentation 5% glucose. use mineral salts medium, lack antibiotic resistance genes plasmids, high yield D-lactate, high product purity reduce costs associated nutrients, purification, containment, biological oxygen demand, waste treatment.
