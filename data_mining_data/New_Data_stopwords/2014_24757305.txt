 Cancer cells generally exhibit increased glycolysis ATP generation (the Warburg effect). Compounds inhibit glycolysis potential applications cancer treatment. dl-glyceraldehyde (DLG) 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) proven effective inhibition glucose metabolism. Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells injected intraperitoneally (i.p) 10-12 weeks old Swiss albino mice, weighing 20 30 g. anticancer activity DLG 2-DG determined tumor volume, tumor weight, viable nonviable tumor cell count, average survival time, percentage increase life span tumor inhibition ratio. blood samples obtained biochemical analysis 9 days treatment study effect liver, kidney haematological parameters. Histopathological examination liver kidney also performed. One-way ANOVA test Dunnett's test used comparisons parameters study groups. DLG 2-DG individually decreased tumor weight, tumor volume, viable tumor cell count significantly increased life span treated mice, however combination found better. biochemical parameters liver kidney functions haematological parameters restored close control group compared EAC bearing mice. Histopathological examination liver kidney EAC control group showed large areas necrosis, congestion mononuclear cell infiltration changes observed liver kidney sections observed i.p injection DLG 2-DG 9 days. Improvement much better group combination two drugs used.
