 Nervous necrosis virus (NNV), piscine nodavirus, caused serious viral nervous necrosis viral encephalopathy retinopathy hatchery-reared larvae juveniles wide range marine teleost species worldwide last two decades. Although mortality NNV-infected larvae nearly 100%, still larvae survive catastrophe. comprehensively understand variations survivors molecular level, collected orange-spotted grouper larvae survived NNV outbreak indoor hatchery southern Taiwan study differential gene expression. Healthy larvae high, medium low levels detected NNV compared morbid larvae using 9600-clone-containing grouper larva cDNA microarray, differential gene expression confirmed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Significant variation exists healthy larvae. following genes upregulated: adenylate kinase 1-2, myosin binding protein H-like, myosin light chain 2, myosin light chain 3, tropomyosin, fast/white muscle troponin embryonic isoform, parvalbumin 1 2 genes. following genes downregulated: apolipoprotein A-I, trypsinogen, pyruvate kinase astacin-like metalloprotease. Moreover, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene transcription significantly higher healthy larvae high virus levels, indicating humoral immunity might protect organisms viral infection. results suggest non-immune-related genes may played important roles survival larval metamorphosis stage, betanodavirus infection.
