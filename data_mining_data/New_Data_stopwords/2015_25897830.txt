 mTOR pathway master regulator cellular growth metabolism. biosynthetic energetic demand rapidly proliferating cells cancer cells met metabolic adaptations increased glycolytic rate known Warburg effect. Herein, characterize anti-tumor effect rapamycin mouse model T-cell lymphoma examine metabolic effects vitro. murine T-cell lymphoma line, MBL2, human cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) lines, HH Hut78, used syngeneic standard NSG mouse models demonstrate marked suppression tumor growth rapamycin accompanied inhibition mTORC1/2. Analysis metabolic phenotype showed substantial reduction glycolytic rate glucose utilization rapamycin-treated lymphoma cells. associated reduced expression glucose transporters glycolytic enzymes cultured cells xenograft tumors. result decrease glycolytic state, rapamycin-treated cells displayed reduced sensitivity low-glucose conditions continued rely mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) sensitivity inhibition OXPHOS. Taken together, demonstrate rapamycin suppresses growth T-cell lymphoma tumors leads reduction aerobic glycolysis counteracting Warburg effect cancer cells.
