 AIMS: Impaired energy metabolism implicated pathogenesis heart failure. Hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance (MR), (13)C-labelled metabolites followed using MR imaging (MRI) spectroscopy (MRS), enabled non-invasive assessment pyruvate metabolism. investigated hypothesis serially examined model heart failure using non-invasive hyperpolarized [(13)C]pyruvate MR, profile vivo pyruvate oxidation would change throughout course disease. METHODS RESULTS: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) induced pigs (n = 5) rapid pacing. Pigs examined using MR weekly time points: cine-MRI assessed cardiac structure function; hyperpolarized [2-(13)C]pyruvate administered intravenously, (13)C MRS monitored [(13)C]glutamate production; (31)P MRS assessed cardiac energetics [phosphocreatine (PCr)/ATP]; hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate administered MRI pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)-mediated pyruvate oxidation via [(13)C]bicarbonate production. Early pacing, cardiac index decreased 25%, PCr/ATP decreased 26%, [(13)C]glutamate production decreased 51%. clinical features DCM appeared, end-diastolic volume increased 40% [(13)C]bicarbonate production decreased 67%. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 protein increased two-fold, phosphorylated Akt decreased half. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 gene expression decreased half third, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite early changes associated cardiac energetics (13)C incorporation Krebs cycle, pyruvate oxidation maintained DCM developed, heart's capacity oxidize pyruvate fats reduced. Hyperpolarized (13)C MR may important characterize metabolic changes occur heart failure progression.
