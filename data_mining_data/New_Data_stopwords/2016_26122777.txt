 Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) biological substance plays important roles cell metabolism physiology. AKG synthesized glucose oxaloacetate plus pyruvate. intermediate tricarboxylic acid cycle, AKG essential oxidation fatty acids, amino acids, glucose. Extracellular AKG significant source energy cells gastrointestinal tract. precursor synthesis glutamate glutamine multiple tissues (including liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, white adipose tissue), AKG bridges carbohydrate nitrogen metabolism conservation amino acids ammonia detoxification. Additionally, emerging evidence shows AKG regulator gene expression cell signaling pathways (including mammalian target rapamycin AMPactivated protein kinase). Thus, AKG attractive dietary supplement animal human nutrition improve cellular energy status, immunity, health.
