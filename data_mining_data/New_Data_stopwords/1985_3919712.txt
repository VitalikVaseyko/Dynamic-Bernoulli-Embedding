 Hepatocytes isolated livers fed rats incubated, presence absence 100 nM-glucagon, substrate mixture containing glucose (10 mM), fructose (4 mM), alanine (3.5 mM), acetate (1.25 mM), ribose (1 mM). given incubation one substrate labelled 14C. Incorporation 14C glucose, glycogen, CO2, lactate, alanine, glutamate, lipid glycerol fatty acids measured 20 40 min incubation quasi-steady-state conditions [Borowitz, Stein & Blum (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1589-1605]. data measured O2 consumption analysed aid structural metabolic model incorporating reactions glycolytic, gluconeogenic, pentose phosphate pathways, associated mitochondrial cytosolic reactions. considerable excess experimental measurements independent flux parameters number independent measurements changes metabolite concentrations allowed stringent test model. satisfactory fit data obtained condition. Significant findings included: control cells glycogenic glucagon-treated cells glycogenolytic second interval; ordered (last in, first out) model glycogen degradation [Devos & (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 99, 161-167] required order fit experimental data; pentose shunt contributed approx. 15% carbon gluconeogenesis control glucagon-treated cells; net flux lower Embden-Meyerhof pathway glycolytic direction except 20-40 min interval glucagon-treated cells; increased gluconeogenesis response glucagon correlated decreased pyruvate kinase flux lactate output; fluxes pyruvate kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase coordinately controlled; Krebs cycle activity change glucagon treatment; flux malic enzyme towards pyruvate formation except control cells interval II; 'futile' cycling five substrate cycles examined (including previously undescribed cycle acetate/acetyl-CoA) consumed 26% cellular ATP production control hepatocytes 21% glucagon-treated cells.
