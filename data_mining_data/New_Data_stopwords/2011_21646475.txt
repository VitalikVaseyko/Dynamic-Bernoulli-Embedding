 contrast normal cells, cancer cells avidly take glucose metabolize lactate even oxygen abundant, phenomenon referred Warburg effect. fundamental alteration glucose metabolism cancer cells enables specific detection positron emission tomography (PET) following i.v. injection glucose analogue (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose ((18)FDG). However, useful imaging technique limited fact cancers avidly take FDG. identify molecular determinants (18)FDG retention, interrogated transcriptomes human-cancer cell lines primary tumors metabolic pathways associated (18)FDG radiotracer uptake. ninety-five metabolic pathways interrogated, glycolysis, several glycolysis-related pathways (pentose phosphate, carbon fixation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, one-carbon-pool folate) showed greatest transcriptional enrichment. "FDG signature" predicted FDG uptake breast cancer cell lines overlapped established gene expression signatures "basal-like" breast cancer subtype MYC-induced tumorigenesis mice. Human breast cancers nuclear MYC staining high RNA expression MYC target genes showed high (18)FDG-PET uptake (P < 0.005). Presence FDG signature similarly associated MYC gene copy gain, increased MYC transcript levels, elevated expression metabolic MYC target genes human breast cancer genomic dataset. Together, findings link clinical observations glucose uptake pathologic molecular subtype human breast cancer. Furthermore, suggest related approaches derive molecular determinants radiotracer retention PET-imaging probes.
