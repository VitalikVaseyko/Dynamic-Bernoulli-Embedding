 work performed gain information role pyruvate kinase isoenzymes regulation renal carbohydrate metabolism. Immunohistochemically, pyruvate kinase type L shown localized proximal tubule nephron pyruvate kinase type M2 distal tubule collecting duct. tight relationship gluconeogenesis pyruvate recycling found. rate gluconeogenesis (8 mumol/g wet wt. per 30 min) order magnitude rate pyruvate recycling (10.92 mumol/g wet wt. per 30 min). Stimulation gluconeogenesis 20 mM lactate kidney cortex slices 24-h-starved rats dibutyryl-cAMP, alanine parathyroid hormone connected decrease pyruvate recycling; inhibition gluconeogenesis due lack Ca2+ incubation medium linked increase pyruvate recycling. degradation [6-14C]glucose lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies CO2 [2-14C]lactate unaffected dibutyryl-cAMP, alanine, epinephrine, vasopressin omission Ca2+ incubation medium. 1 mM dibutyryl-cAMP 5 mM alanine alter activities oxaloacetate decarboxylase, 'malic' enzyme malate dehydrogenase rat kidney cortex. Since aerobic glycolysis distal tubules collecting ducts influenced hormones, dibutyryl-cAMP Ca2+, pyruvate kinase type M2 residing tissue unlikely control point glycolysis. Since tissue degrades one-seventh glucose formed via gluconeogenesis, contribute significantly pyruvate recycling. Therefore, decrease pyruvate recycling presence dibutyryl-cAMP alanine rat kidney cortex slices, leading increased renal gluconeogenesis, ascribed regulation pyruvate kinase type L.
