 OBJECTIVES: Pyruvate kinase type M2 (TuM2-PK) thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) key enzymes involved tumor cells metabolism proliferation. explored association preoperative circulating levels disease recurrence patients renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: measured plasma levels TuM2-PK levels serum TK1 activity preoperatively patients RCC, using quantitative ELISA, correlated results clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels TuM2-PK TK1 found 116 patients RCC compared 20 healthy participants (P < .001 P = .03), compared 27 patients benign kidney tumors (P = .13 P = .72). significant association level TuM2-PK TK1 activity stage (P = .01 P = .04). 2 markers TuM2-PK significantly associated tumor grade (P = .001). presence extensive tumor necrosis (> 50%) associated high TuM2-PK (P = .001) low TK1 (P = .03). 5-year recurrence-free survival patients elevated TuM2-PK TK1 significantly lower compared patients normal marker levels (55% vs 94%, P < .001 21% vs 90%, P = .002). Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazard analysis demonstrated TuM2-PK TK1, adjusted stage, grade tumor necrosis retained independent predictors disease recurrence (HR = 7.3, P = .04 HR = 3.8, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: measurements 2 circulating biomarkers, TuM2-PK TK1, RCC patients nephrectomy useful predicting recurrence stratifying patients risk groups possible adjuvant treatment.
