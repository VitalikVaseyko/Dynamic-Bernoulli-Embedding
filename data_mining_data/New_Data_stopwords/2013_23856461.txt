 Enzymology tends focus highly specific effects substrates, allosteric modifiers, products occurring low concentrations, informative enzyme's catalytic mechanism. hypothesized relatively high vivo concentrations, important molecular monitors state living cells, ATP, affect multiple enzymes former interactions gone unnoticed enzymology. test hypothesis terms effect ATP, ADP, AMP might major free-energy delivering pathway yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Assaying cell-free extracts, collected comprehensive set quantitative kinetic data concerning enzymes glycolytic ethanol fermentation pathways. determined systematically extent enzyme activities depend concentrations adenine nucleotides. found effects adenine nucleotides enzymes catalysing reactions directly involved substrate product, substantial. includes effects Michaelis-Menten constants, adding new perspective these, 100 years introduction.
