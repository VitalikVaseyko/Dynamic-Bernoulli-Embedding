 L-type pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) highly purified adult human liver. purification included ammonium sulphate fractionation, DEAE-Sephadex batchwise absorption two CM-Sephadex chromatographies selective elution ligands; former chromatography pyruvate kinase eluted ATP, latter one phosphoenolpyruvate fructose 1,6-diphosphate. last step purification procedure involved hydroxyapatite column chromatography. purification procedure allowed us obtain 3.6 mg protein specific activity 190 I.U./mg, i.e. 1200-fold purification overall yield 8%. preparation homogenous judged immunodiffusion, acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulphate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti L-type pyruvate kinase antibodies obtained rabbits antigenic properties L-type pyruvate kinase studied. enzyme appeared tetramer (molecular weight 220 000-240 000) subunits similar molecular weight 60 000). Two interconvertible major forms found isoelectrofocusing sucrose gradient acrylamide slab gel: one isoelectric point 5.85 +/- 0.09 major enzymatic form incubation fructose 1,6-diphosphate high concentrations SH reagents. form (isoelectric point 6.28 +/- 0.03) major form L-type pyruvate kinase liver crude extract, incubation purified enzyme proteic fraction isolated liver extract ammonium sulphate precipitation.
