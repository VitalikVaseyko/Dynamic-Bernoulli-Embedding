 Inhibitors human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) promising therapeutic agents cancer. development LDH-A inhibitors possess cellular activities far proved particularly challenging, since enzyme's active site narrow highly polar. recent past, able develop glucose-conjugated N-hydroxyindole-based LDH-A inhibitor designed exploit sugar avidity expressed cancer cells (the Warburg effect). Herein describe structural modulation sugar moiety class inhibitors, insertion alpha-D-mannose, beta-D-gulose, beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine portions structures. stereospecific chemical synthesis, involves substrate-dependent stereospecific glycosylation step, biological activity reducing lactate production proliferation cancer cells reported. Interestingly, alpha-D-mannose conjugate displayed best properties cellular assays, demonstrating efficient antiglycolytic antiproliferative activity cancer cells.
