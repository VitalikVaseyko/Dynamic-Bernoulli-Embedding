 presented [Termonia, Y. & Ross, J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 2952-2956] analysis glycolysis based experimental findings. Here, give interpretation based concepts efficiency, resonance response, control features available highly nonlinear reaction kinetics. comprehensive model glycolysis, presented numerical evaluation concentration oscillations, entropy production, average ATP/ADP ratios separated two subsystems: one phosphofructokinase (PFKase) reaction, pyruvate kinase (PKase) reaction. analyze subsystem separately find that, range parameter values around best estimates obtained experimental data, PFKase reaction exhibits sustained oscillations. PKase reaction, hand, stable stationary state shows oscillatory relaxation. period PFKase reaction within 25% obtained computer simulation full model. Moreover, if, given set kinetic parameters, period oscillations PFKase reaction order magnitude period oscillatory relaxation PKase reaction, onset oscillatory behavior past marginal stability forces tuning PFKase reaction period PKase reaction. Thus, PKase reaction tunes frequency primary oscillophor, PFKase reaction, resonance response results PKase reaction. find result substantial range parameters. sharp increase ATP/ADP ratio decrease dissipation (entropy production) seen result forced tuning resonance. origin remarkable control feature tuning one part pathway another follows reaction mechanism coupling two parts and, case glycolysis, realized intermediate fructose 1,6-diphosphate, participates crucially PFKase PKase reactions.
