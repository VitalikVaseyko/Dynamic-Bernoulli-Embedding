 mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) plays central strategic roles control use glucose-linked substrates sources oxidative energy precursors biosynthesis fatty acids. activity mitochondrial complex regulated continuous operation competing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) reactions. resulting interconversion cycle determines fraction active (nonphosphorylated) pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. Tissue-specific metabolic state-specific control achieved selective expression distinct regulatory properties least four PDK isozymes two PDP isozymes. PDK isoforms members family serine kinases structurally related cytoplasmic Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases. catalytic subunits PDP isoforms Mg2+-dependent members phosphatase 2C family binuclear metal-binding sites within active site. dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase-binding protein (E3BP) multidomain proteins form oligomeric core complex. One three lipoyl domains (two E2) selectively bind PDK PDP1. adaptive interactions predominantly influence catalytic efficiencies effector control regulatory enzymes. fatty acids preferred source acetyl-CoA NADH, feedback inactivation PDC accomplished activity certain kinase isoforms stimulated upon preferentially binding lipoyl domain containing reductively acetylated lipoyl group. PDC activity increased Ca2+-sensitive tissues elevating PDP1 activity via Ca2+-dependent binding PDP1 lipoyl domain E2. starvation, irrecoverable loss glucose carbons restricted minimizing PDC activity due high kinase activity results overexpression specific kinase isoforms. Overexpression PDK isoforms deleteriously hinders glucose consumption unregulated diabetes.
