 binding various regulatory ligands substrates fructose bisphosphate activated pyruvate kinase Escherichia coli studied equilibrium. allosteric activator, fructose bisphosphate, substrate phosphoenolypyruvate bind cooperative manner enzyme. one site ligands per monomer. presence fructose bisphosphate binding phosphoenolpyruvate follows absorption isotherm, i.e., homotropic interactions substrate lost. reciprocal experiments, however, phosphoenolpyruvate KCl required order facilitate binding activator. allosteric inhibitors pyruvate kinase, ATP, succinyl-CoA, GTP compete enzyme surface binding activator, fructose bisphosphate, Inhibitor pairs ATP succinyl-CoA together bring cooperative additive inhibition binding activator. nucleotide substrate GDP allosteric inhibitor GTP contrast activator two seemingly noninteracting sites monomer. saturating presence fructose bisphosphate, however, binding GDP possibly also GTP occurs one site monomer. Magnesium ions inhibit binding GDP GTP. KCl activator enzyme along analogues, ammonia, thallium, rubidium, etc., enhances binding phosphoenolpyruvate nucleotides fructose bisphosphate. data analyzed basis two-site model, substrate fructose bisphosphate bind one conformation inhibitors other.
