 Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase rat liver phosphorylated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [gamma-32P]ATP. Brief exposure 32P-labeled enzyme trypsin removed radioactivity enzyme core produced single-labeled peptide. partial sequence 17-amino acid peptide found Ser-Arg-Pro-Ser(P)-Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-(Ser2, Glx2, Pro2, Leu, Arg2). kinetics cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation native fructose bisphosphatase compared rat liver type L pyruvate kinase sequence around phosphoserine known (Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val; Hjelmquist, G., Anderson, J., Edlund, B., Engstrom, L. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 61, 559-563). Km pyruvate kinase (17 microM) less fructose bisphosphatase (58 microM); Vmax 3-fold greater pyruvate kinase substrate. relationship rates phosphorylation native substrates amino acid sequences surrounding phosphorylated sites discussed.
