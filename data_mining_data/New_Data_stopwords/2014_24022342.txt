 Deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNAs involved carcinogenesis various cancers, including lung cancer. HIF1a suggested master regulator hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. relationship HIF1a expression progression non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) fully understood, whether HIF1a expression regulated miRNAs process remains unclear. study, found upregulation HIF1a expression reduction miR-199a levels highly associated NSCLC progression. NSCLC cells derived cancer tissues low miR-199a levels showed high HIF1a expression high proliferation capacity. Moreover, HIF1a glycolysis inhibitors suppress proliferation NSCLC cells. MiR-199a overexpression suppressed hypoxia-induced proliferation NSCLC cells targeting elevated HIF1a blocking downstream upregulation PDK1 without affecting AKT activation. Together, results indicate downregulation miR-199a essential hypoxia-induced proliferation derepressing expression HIF1a expression affecting HIF1a mediated glycolytic pathway NSCLC progression.
