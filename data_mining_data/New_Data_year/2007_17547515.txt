Human pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), an autosomal recessive disorder produced by mutations in the PKLR gene, is the most common cause of chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Transduction of wild-type erythroid (R-type) pyruvate kinase (RPK) cDNA into deficient hematopoietic stem cells could be of potential use as rescue therapy in severe clinical cases. In this study, gammaretroviral vectors expressing human RPK were designed as possible gene therapy candidates for this disease. Through real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and flow cytometric analysis, we demonstrate stable RPK expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated murine erythroleukemia cells. In this in vitro assay, the proportion of transduced cells and the intensity of expression of the transgene remained unaltered after 6 months of culture. Moreover, transplanting human RPK-transduced Lin(-)Sca-1(+) mouse cells in myeloablated primary and secondary recipients rendered high proportions of erythroid precursors and mature erythrocytes expressing RPK, without inducing hematopoietic effects. These findings suggest that retroviral vectors could be useful for the delivery and expression of RPK in erythroid cells, and provide evidence of the potential use of gene therapy strategies to phenotypically correct erythroid PKD.
