Two overlapping clones, covering the entire coding sequence of human M2-type pyruvate kinase (PK) cDNA, were isolated and sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing results showed that they contained the 109-bp 5'-untranslated region, the 1593-bp coding region and the 585-bp 3'-untranslated region. Nucleotide sequence homology was 90% and 69% with rat M2-type and L-type PK cDNA, respectively. In situ hybridization using the human M2-type PK cDNA probe disclosed that the gene for M2-type PK is located at band q22 on chromosome 15. Northern blot analysis with RNA from human hepatoma demonstrated that M2-type PK was predominantly expressed in hepatoma cells, whereas L-type PK was preferentially expressed in the non-tumor portion of the liver.
