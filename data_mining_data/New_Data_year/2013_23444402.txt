The effects of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), a master kinase in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, on platelet activation are unknown. Accordingly, platelet-specific PDK1-deficient mice were characterized to elucidate the platelet-related function(s) of PDK1. We found that PDK1 deficiency caused mild thrombocytopenia. The aggregation of PDK1(-/-) platelets was diminished in response to low levels of thrombin, U46619, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate. Further results demonstrated that PDK1 regulates thrombin-induced platelet activation by affecting alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling. This result provided an explanation for the diminished spreading of PDK1(-/-) platelets on immobilized fibrinogen (Fg) and the decreased rate of clot retraction in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) containing PDK1(-/-) platelets. PDK1 deficiency diminished agonist-induced Akt Ser473 phosphorylation and thoroughly abolished Akt Thr308 and Gsk3beta Ser9 phosphorylation in response to agonist treatment and platelet spreading, respectively. A Gsk3beta inhibitor fully restored the aggregation of PDK1(-/-) platelets in response to low levels of thrombin, normal spreading of PDK1(-/-) platelets on Fg, and normal clot retraction in PRP containing PDK1(-/-) platelets. Those results indicated that Gsk3beta is one of the major downstream effectors of PDK1 in thrombin-induced platelet activation and alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling. In addition, in vivo data demonstrated that PDK1 is an important regulator in arterial thrombosis formation.
