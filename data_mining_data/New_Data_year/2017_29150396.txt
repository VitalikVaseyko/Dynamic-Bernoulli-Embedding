Overexpression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs), especially PDK1 has been observed in a variety of cancers. Thus, targeting PDK1 offers an attractive opportunity for the development of cancer therapies. In this letter, we reported the identification of two novel PDK1 inhibitors as anti-osteosarcoma agents. We found that TM-1 and TM-2 inhibited PDK1 with the IC50 values of 2.97 and 3.41muM, respectively. Furthermore, TM-1 and TM-2 dose-dependently reduced phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Finally, TM-1 and TM-2 were found to inhibit the proliferation of MG-63 cells with the EC50 values of 14.5, and 11.0muM, respectively, meaning TM-1 and TM-2 could be promising leads for the discovery of potent PDK1 inhibitors.
