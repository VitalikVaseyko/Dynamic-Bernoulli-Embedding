The complete family of expressed pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) genes in the tissues of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, consists of four members. Our previous study [Terazawa, Y., Tokmakov, A., Shirouzu, M., Yokoyama, S., 2005. Molecular cloning and expression analysis of PDK family genes in Xenopus laevis reveal oocyte-specific PDK isoform. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 338, 1798-1804] revealed that expression patterns of PDK genes differ greatly in the oocytes and somatic tissues of the adult frog. In the present work, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis, we demonstrate that the major transition from the oocyte-specific to somatic tissue-specific xPDK expression pattern occurs at the late stages of Xenopus embryogenesis after mid-blastula transition (MBT). Also, we show that the content of mRNA for xPDKo3, which is the predominant PDK isoform in oocytes and eggs, increases by about 3-fold during maturation. Other PDK family genes are down-regulated during oogenesis, thus being at their lowest expression levels in the grown-up oocytes, matured eggs, and early embryos. The expression of all PDK genes increases several-fold in the embryogenesis following MBT. Analysis of protein expression using an antibody raised against C-terminal of xPDKo3 confirmed isoform-specific up-regulation of xPDKo3 late in maturation and revealed cytoplasmic and mitochondrial localization of this protein. Bioinformatics and mass-spectrometric analyses allowed identification of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a peptide cleavage site in xPDKo3 molecule.
