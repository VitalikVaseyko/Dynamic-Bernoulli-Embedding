Adenosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphorothioate, Sp-diastereomer was hydrolyzed by cyclic phosphodiesterase from beef heart in the presence of [18O]water to [18O]adenosine 5'-phosphorothioate. This was phosphorylated by myokinase and pyruvate kinase to [18O]adenosine 5'-(1-thiotriphosphate),Sp-diastereomer. The position of 18O was determined to be in a nonbridging position. This result indicates that the hydrolysis proceeded with inversion of configuration at phosphorus.
