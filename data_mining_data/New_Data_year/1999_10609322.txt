The age changes of enzymes of activity catalyzing several links of energy metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c-oxidase) and antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) in bone marrow myeloid cells and blood leukocytes of pig in the 10-day period after birth were investigated. The bone marrow cells and leukocytes of the new born piglets were characterized by low intensity of oxidative steps of energy metabolism as well as by low activity of antioxidant enzymes. In the period of neonatal adaptation reorganization of energy metabolism, particularly, intensification of oxidative processes in the investigated cells occurred. It included the pentose phosphate way and cytochrome c-oxidase activation. During the neonatal period of development the functional activity of antioxidant enzymes in the investigated cells of piglets increased.
