BACKGROUND: Initially identified as a molecule that regulates the final step of glycolysis, the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) was recently reported to have a central role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells as well as participating in cell cycle progression and gene transcription. Despite intensive efforts, the intricate molecular mechanisms through which PKM2 regulates tumor progression remain elusive. METHODS: The proliferation and apoptosis of various pancreatic cancer cells using lentiviral-mediated PKM2 abrogation were assessed in vitro via Western blot and flow cytometric assay while the in vivo experiments involved tumor xenograft on chicken chorionallantoic membranes and immunohistochemistry on human tissue specimens. In order to decipher the molecular mechanism of HIF-1alpha and p65/RelA regulation by PKM2 in cancer cells cultivated in hypoxic atmosphere or normoxia we involved various biochemical assays such as Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, reporter gene assay and ELISA. RESULTS: Strong expression of PKM2 was observed in 68 % of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma specimens and almost all analyzed pancreatic cancer cell lines. Abrogation of PKM2 resulted in impaired proliferation and augmented apoptosis in vitro as well as impaired tumor growth and decreased blood vessel formation in vivo. Furthermore, deletion of PKM2 negatively impacted hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation and promoter activity ultimately resulting in impaired secretion of VEGF. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in hypoxic pancreatic tumors PKM2 interferes both with NF-kappaB/p65 and HIF-1alpha activation that ultimately triggers VEGF-A secretion and subsequent blood vessel formation.
