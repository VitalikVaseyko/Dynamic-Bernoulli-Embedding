The activities of red cell enzymes enolase (ENO), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), hexokinase (HK), aldolase (ALD), and pyruvate kinase (PK) were followed sequentially in term infants from birth to one year of age. At birth, red cell PGK and ENO activities were disproportionately elevated when compared to both red cells with a similar mean cell age and those with a younger mean cell age; red cell PFK was significantly decreased. There was a progressive full in PGK and ENO activities and rise in PFK levels toward normal values in the first year of life. The most significant changes in PGK, ENO, and PFK appeared to begin at 8 to 9 wk of age. ENO and PFK activities stabilized at approximately 5 to 6 months of age at values compatible with mean cell age; mean PGK levels remained mildly elevated at 11 to 12 months. The age-dependent enzymes G-6-PD, PK, ALD, and HK were all elevated in term newborns. G-6-PD and ALD progressively decreased in activity during the first year of life. PK and HK decreased in activity until 8 to 9 wk when there was a secondary rise in mean activity. Mean red cell G-6-PD, PK, ALD, and HK levels remained mildly to moderately elevated at 11 to 12 months of life, suggesting the persistence of a relatively young red cell population throughout the first year of life.
