Glycolytic enzymes were found to bind to isolated coated vesicles. From a preparation of rabbit muscle myogen mixed with clathrin coated vesicles greater than 75% of four enzymes, aldolase. glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were found to pellet with isolated coated vesicles upon centrifugation at 60.000 g for 1 h. The binding of purified aldolase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, the muscle form and the heart form of lactate dehydrogenase was characterized further. Substrates were found to elute three of the enzymes and binding was determined to be a function of ionic strength.
