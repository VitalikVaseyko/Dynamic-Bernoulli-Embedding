The results of a quantitative spectrophotometric enzyme assay, a fluorescent spot test and a cytochemical assay for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were compared systematically. The high sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay and the fluorescent spot test in the detection of severely deficient individuals was confirmed. For the detection of heterozygote females, however both tests were unreliable; the sensitivities of the fluorescent spot test and the spectrophotometric assay being 32% and 11% respectively. Specificities for both tests were high (99%). Introduction of the ratio of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase (G-6-PD/PK ratio) activities increased the sensitivity of the spectrophotometric assay to nearly 100%. It is concluded that the fluorescent spot test should be used for the diagnosis of G-6-PD deficiency in developing countries; whereas if spectrophotometric enzyme assays are available, the G-6-PD/PK ratio should always be performed. In cases where the ratio is less than 0.70, cytochemical analysis is indicated.
