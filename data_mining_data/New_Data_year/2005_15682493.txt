AIM: Intestinal ischemia (Ii) is an abdominal emergency due to blockade of the superior mesenteric artery resulting in 60-100% mortality if diagnosed late. Changes in several biochemical parameters such as D (-)-lactate, Creatinine kinase isoenzymes and lactate dehydrogenase suggested for early diagnosis, lack specificity and sensitivity. Therefore a biochemical parameter with greater sensitivity needs to be identified. METHODS: Wistar male rats were randomly assigned into two groups; control sham operated (n = 24) and ischemic test (n = 24) group. Superior mesenteric arterial occlusion was performed in the ischemic test group for 1 h. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was estimated in blood from portal vein, right ventricle of heart, dorsal aorta (DA) and inferior vena cava (IVC). The Serum glutamic acid pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) was also estimated in blood from portal vein and right ventricle of heart. RESULTS: A significant increase (P<0.001) in the levels of ADH in both portal blood as well as heart blood of the test group (232.72+/-99.45 EU and 250.85+/-95.14 EU, respectively) as compared to the control group (46.39+/-21.69 EU and 65.38+/-30.55 EU, respectively) were observed. Similarly, increased levels of ADH were observed in blood samples withdrawn from DA and IVC in test animals (319.52+/-80.14 EU and 363.90+/-120.68 EU, respectively) as compared to the control group (67.68+/-63.22 EU and 72.50+/-58.45 EU, respectively). However, in test animals there was significant increase in SGPT in portal blood (P = 0.054) without much increase in heart blood. CONCLUSION: Significant increase in the levels of ADH in portal and heart blood within 1 h of SMA occlusion without increase in SGPT in heart blood, suggests that the origin of ADH is from ischemic intestine and not from liver. Similarly, raised ADH levels were found in DA and IVC as well. IVC blood does represent peripheral blood sample. A raised level of ADH in test animals confirms it to be a potential marker in the early diagnosis of Ii.
