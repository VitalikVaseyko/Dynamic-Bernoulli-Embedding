The structure and temporal expression of two Xenopus cDNAs encoding the beta subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (XPdhE1 beta) have been determined. XPdhE1 beta was 88% homologous to mature human PdhE1 beta, but the putative N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide was poorly conserved. Zygotic expression of XPdhE1 beta mRNA was detected at neural tube closure and increased until stage 40. RT-PCR cloning identified a short homology to a protein kinase open reading frame within the 3' non-coding sequence of the XPdhE1 beta cDNAs. This homology, which occurred on the antisense cDNA strand, was shown by strand specific RT-PCR to be transcribed in vivo as part of an antisense RNA. Northern analysis showed that this RNA formed part of an abundant and heterogeneous population of antisense and sense poly(A)-RNAs transcribed from the XPdhE1 beta loci and coordinately regulated with message production.
