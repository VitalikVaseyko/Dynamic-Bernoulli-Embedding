Embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) type RNA binding protein 3 (ETR-3; also called NAPOR, CUGBP2, or BRUNOL3) has been implicated in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, RNA editing, stability and translation. Here, we report that the ETR-3 protein contains multiple regions that control its subcellular localization and are important for its activity as a splicing regulator. We cloned ETR-3 from chicken heart and fused it to the C terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFPcETR3vL). GFPcETR3vL is found predominantly in the nucleus and is an active regulator of alternative splicing in cotransfection assays with a cardiac troponin T minigene. ETR-3 contains two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a 210-amino acid divergent domain, and a C-terminal RRM. We demonstrate that the C terminus contains a strong nuclear localization signal overlapping the third RRM, which can confer nuclear localization on a normally cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase chimera. Additional deletions revealed nuclear localization and export activities in the divergent domain of ETR-3, as well as regions within the first two RRMs that are important for cytoplasmic localization. The nuclear export activity of the divergent domain is sensitive to leptomycin B, indicating that export to the cytoplasm is mediated via a CRM1-dependent pathway. The C terminus and a region within the divergent domain were also shown to be important for splicing activity of ETR-3. This is the first characterization of protein domains involved in mediating the subcellular localization and splicing activity of a member of the CELF family of RNA processing regulators.
