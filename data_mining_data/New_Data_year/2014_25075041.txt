AIM: Abnormalities in apoptotic signalling pathways often occur in cancer cells and limit the successful chemotherapy outcomes in cancers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new anticancer agents with novel mechanisms of action to overcome the resistance effect in chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, the anticancer effects and the mechanisms of action of 17betaH-neriifolin (cardiac glycoside) were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and a proteomic approach in treated and non-treated SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: 17betaH-neriifolin was found to be active with IC50 values of 0.01 +/- 0.001 in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cell line, as evaluated by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. RESULTS from TUNEL assay indicated that 17betaH-neriifolin caused apoptosis in SKOV-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Based on differential analysis of treated and non-treated SKOV-3 two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) profiles, four proteins, namely vimentin (VIM), pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1) and transgelin (TAGLN1) were identified to be involved in apoptosis. Other proteins including piggybac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5), DENN/MADD domain containing 2D (DENND2D) and formin-like 1(FMNL) have also been identified to be associated in SKOV-3 cell death induced by 17betaH-neriifolin. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide new insights on the potential of 17betaH-neriifolin's mechanism of action in killing ovarian cancer cells.
