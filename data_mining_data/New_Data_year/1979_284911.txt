Whether and if so to what extent the microflora in human saliva and plaque metabolizes L sorbitol, a sugar exchange substance, was studied. The Warburg technique was used for this investigation. It was established that only traces of L sorbitol were present in the saliva and the plaque deposits. It may therefore be assumed that L sorbitol has an extremely low cariogenic effect.
