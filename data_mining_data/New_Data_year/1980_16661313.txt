The synthesis of Mg-protoporphyrin-IX from exogenous protoporphyrin-IX, in a crude plastid pellet extracted from greening cucumber cotyledons was found to require l-glutamate as a cofactor. It has now been shown that glutamate acts in the presence of contaminating mitochondria to provide an ATP regenerating system. With purified plastids, Mg chelatase is not stimulated by glutamate; instead, it requires a high concentration of ATP and is greatly stimulated by added phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. GTP, UTP, CTP, and ITP will not substitute for ATP. ADP in the absence of an ATP generating system is completely ineffective, whereas it is slightly inhibitory in the presence of 10 mm ATP. AMP is strongly inhibitory in the reaction; 50% inhibition is obtained at approximately 3.5 mm AMP in the presence of 10 mm ATP.
