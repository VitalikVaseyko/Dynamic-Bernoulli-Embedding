1. Intact and pure parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells were isolated from rat liver. The specific activities of several mitochondrial enzymes were determined in both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell homogenates to characterize the mitochondria in these liver cell types. 2. In general the activities of mitochondrial enzymes were lower in non-parenchymal liver cells than in parenchymal cells. The specific activity of pyruvate carboxylase in non-parenchymal cells expressed as the percentage of that in parenchymal cells was onlu 2% for glutamate dehydrogenase 4.3% and for cytochrome c oxidase 79.4%. Monoamine oxidase, as an exception, has an equal specific activity in both cell types. 3. The activity ratio of pyruvate carboxylase at 10 mM pyruvate over 0.1 mM pyruvate is 3.35 for parenchymal cells and 1.50 for non-parenchymal cells. This indicates that non-parenchymal liver cells only contain the high affinity form of pyruvate carboxylase in contrast to parenchymal cells. 4. The ratio of glycerol-3-phosphate cytochrome c reductase over succinate cytochrome c reductase activity differs from parenchymal (0.01) and non-parenchymal cells (0.10). This might indicate that the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, which is important for the transport of reduction equivalents for cytosol to mitochondria is relatively more active in non-parenchymal cells than in parenchymal cells. 5. The activity pattern of mitochondrial enzymes in parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell homogenates indicates that these cell types contain different types of mitochondria. The presence of these different cell types in liver will therefore contribute to the heterogeneity of isolated rat liver mitochondria in which the mitochondria from non-parenchymal cells might be considered as "non-gluconeogenic".
