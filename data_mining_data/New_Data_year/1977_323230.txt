A mutant of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is deficient in pyruvate kinase activity has been isolated. The mutant strain is capable of growth when supplied with lactate as the carbon source but not capable of growth when supplied with dextrose or other fermentable sugars or glycerol as the carbon source. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the phenotype of the pyruvate kinase-deficient strain was due to a single nuclear mutation, which was designated pyk1, and preliminary genetic mapping experiments located the pyk1 locus on chromosome I, 30 centimorgans from the ade1 locus. Adenine nucleotide levels in the mutant and parental strains were compared when the cells were subjected to various growth and starvation conditions. When carbon supply and energy production were dissociated by supplying the mutant strain with dextrose, adenine nucleotide levels fell dramatically. This result suggests that the initial reactions of glycolysis are not rate limiting, nor are they readily inhibited by feedback controls.
