1. Electron microscopic studies of the sieve tube sap obtained from the secondary phloem of Robinia pseudoacacia by the method of Hartig (1860) showed the presence of well developed mitochondria in addition to membrane fragments. 2. In this sieve tube sap the following enzymes could be detected qualitatively: UTP-glucose-1-phosphate-uridyl transferase, UDPG-fructose glucosyl transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase (for glucose and fructose), phosphohexose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, and UDPG-pyrophosphatase. 3. The following enzymes were determined quantitatively: phosphorylase, amylase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, NAD(+)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, fumarase, malate dehydrogenase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase, and anorganic pyrophosphatase. 4. The following enzymes could not be detected: UDGP dehydrogenase, UDPG-fructose-6-phosphate-glucosyltransferase, invertase, phosphoglucomutase, lactate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase. 5. The enzyme pattern in the sieve tube saps of Tilia platyphyllos, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus americana, Quercus borealis maxima, and Salix viminalis is qualitatively similar to that of Robinia, but shows quantitative differences (as far as analyzed). 6. The meaning of the results for the metabolism and function of the sieve tubes in situ is discussed.
