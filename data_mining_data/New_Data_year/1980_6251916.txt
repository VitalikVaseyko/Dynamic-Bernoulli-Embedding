Phenylephrine in the presence of 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and propanolol caused a 40-50% inhibition of pyruvate kinase (type L) activity in isolated hepatocytes, which was accompanied by a 2-3-fold increase in the phosphate content of the enzyme. These changes were blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist dihydroergocryptine and could not be accounted for by the slight increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity generated by the alpha-adrenergic agonist. It is concluded that a significant component of the inhibition of hepatic pyruvate kinase mediated by alpha-adrenergic agonists can be attributed to a cyclic AMP-independent alteration in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme.
