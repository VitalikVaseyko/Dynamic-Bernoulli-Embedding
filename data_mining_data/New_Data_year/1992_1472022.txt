Five Dnase 1 footprints, termed boxes L1 to L5, have been characterized in the 280 bp upstream from the cap site of the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene. They bind from 3' to 5', the factors HNF1, HNF4, MLTF, and a non-identified protein referred to as L5 binding factor (L5-BF). These elements, individually or variably combined, were tested by cell-free transcription. The L1 box stimulates both L-PK and TK promoters, but in the context of L-PK promoter, it cooperates with the L3 element to reach a high level of transcriptional activation. The L3 and L4 elements exhibit weaker influences, increased by homologous or heterologous interactions. The L5 box behaves as a promoter-dependent negative regulatory element.
