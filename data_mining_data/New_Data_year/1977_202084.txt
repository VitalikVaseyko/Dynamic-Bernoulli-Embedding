Gluconeogenesis was stimulated in rat liver tissues if 38.5% of carbohydrates were substituted in the diet by 1,3-butane diol used as a source of energy. Under these conditions concentration of substrates (phosphoenol pyruvate, malate, oxalacetate), participating in coupling of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, was increased in liver tissue; activity of gluconeogenesis key enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase) was also increased. Decrease in the ratio NAD+/NADH showed that the nicotinamide nucleotide pool acquired the most distinct reducing properties of cytoplasma and mitochondria of rats maintained on the diet. The value of phosphate potential (the ration ATP/ADP/Pn) was decreased during the experiment due to increase of ATP utilization in gluconeogenesis.
