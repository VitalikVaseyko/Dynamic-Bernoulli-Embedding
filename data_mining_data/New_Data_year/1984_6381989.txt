The hypothesis concerning the existence of a self-maintaining, i. e. "immortal" hemopoietic stem cell has no conclusive evidence. The data demonstrating the existence of hemopoietic cells with very high proliferative potentials, which are formed only during embryogenesis are discussed. Clonal expansion of these cells can support hemopoiesis during the entire life of the adult organism.
