The purpose of this report was to describe mRNA abundance for the glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase in ischemic and adjacent aerobic myocardium. Mechanical, metabolic, and mRNA data were acquired in a pig model of regulated coronary flow using extracorporeal perfusion. Trials of coronary hypoperfusion included sustained and intermittent exposures of acute ischemia with or without reperfusion. These were compared with a chronic 4-day model of partial coronary stenosis. In ischemic tissues, levels of mRNA, normalized by mRNA for beta-actin, were increased over control values for GAPDH (range 2.7- to 4.6-fold), pyruvate kinase (2.9-fold), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (2.1-fold). It is of interest that increases in mRNA levels over control values were also observed in adjacent aerobic heart muscle from intervention hearts, including 3.6- to 4.5-fold elevations in message for GAPDH and a 2.1-fold increase in signal for pyruvate dehydrogenase. Augmentation in mRNA abundance occurred in as short a time as 40 min of ischemia and was maintained for as long as 4 days in partial coronary stenosis. Whether the former time was of an interval sufficient to affect protein production is problematic, but the latter time was ample to influence enzyme concentration, which may in turn have regulated glycolysis in this condition.
