Metal pollution causes disturbances at various levels of biological organization in most species. Important physiological functions could be affected in the exposed individuals and among the main physiological functions, immunity may provide one (or more) effector(s) whose expression can be directly affected by a metal exposure in various macroinvertebrates. Protein expressions were studied in order to test them as molecular biomarkers of metal exposure in Eisenia fetida. Selected effectors were calmodulin, heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, metallothionein, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, transcriptionally controlled tumor protein, protein kinase C, ubiquitin and cyclophilin-A. The level of expression of each gene was analysed in whole organism following exposures to cadmium in soil using real-time PCR. Metallothionein, transcriptionally controlled tumor protein and cyclophilin-A expression were also measured following copper exposures in soil because these genes seemed to be sensitive to copper. This work enabled to distinguish metallothionein and cyclophilin-A among the 15 selected effectors. A strong decrease of the number of transcripts was also detected for most effectors soon after the exposure to cadmium suggesting that a trade-off mechanism occurs.
