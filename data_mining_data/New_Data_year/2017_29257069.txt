Focus on the Warburg effect, initially descriptive of increased glycolysis in cancer cells, has served to illuminate mitochondrial function in many other pathologies. This review explores our current understanding of the Warburg effect's role in cancer, diabetes and ageing. We highlight how it can be regulated through a chain of oncogenic events, as a chosen response to impaired glucose metabolism or by chance acquisition of genetic changes associated with ageing. Such chain, choice or chance perspectives can be extended to help understand neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease, providing clues with scope for therapeutic intervention. It is anticipated that exploration of Warburg effect pathways in extreme conditions, such as deep space, will provide further insights crucial for comprehending complex metabolic diseases, a frontier for medicine that remains equally significant for humanity in space and on earth.
