The biochemical markers of muscle tissue (creatine- and pyruvate-kinase activities and myosin chains maintenance) have been studied at different stages of regeneration process in newt and annelid worms. The enzymes' activity and myosin chains maintenance decrease at the stage of dedifferentiation and return to the standard under redifferentiation of regenerating sites. In some cases the increase of the enzyme activity during redifferentiation is remarked. The results obtained are compared with data about changes of the biochemical markers during embryogenesis and post-embryogenesis. The community of the mechanisms of differentiation and embryogenesis is discussed.
