The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a small macropodid marsupial in which the major part of weaning occupies the period between 28 and 36 weeks of pouch life. Before weaning the diet of the tammar is high in carbohydrate and low in lipid/volatile fatty acid whereas the reverse applies after weaning. The adult tammar is a forestomach fermenter. The aim of this study was to elucidate some of the physiological and metabolic changes associated with this major change in the diet. Hepatic glycogen content increased gradually early in development to a maximum of 7% of liver weight at 28-30 weeks of pouch life. It then fell precipitously to less than 1% of liver weight at 36 weeks before recovering to the adult level of about 3% liver weight. Plasma glucose levels were maintained at about 10 mM until 36 weeks, after which they fell gradually to adult values of about 4 mM. Hepatic hexokinase activity increased several-fold between 18 and 30 weeks of pouch life, remained high until 42 weeks, and then fell to the adult level. The hepatic activities of fructose-bisphosphatase and particulate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were unchanged during development but soluble hepatic PEPCK activity, which was low until 28 weeks of pouch life, increased 3-4 fold between 30 and 36 weeks and then fell slightly to the adult level. Hepatic pyruvate kinase increased in activity up to 28 weeks and then fell to about half peak values at 36 weeks and 20% of peak activity in the adult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
