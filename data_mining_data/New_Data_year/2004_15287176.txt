Effect of Capparis spinosa (C. spinosa) and Acacia arabica (A. arabica) dry powder as plant molluscicide on some glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes on snail tissues, was investigated. Lactate debydrogenase (LDH), Pyruvate Kinase (PK), Hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) as important glycolytic enzymes, were markedly manipulated by both plants when measured one day and one week post-treatment. On the other hand glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6Pase), fructose 1.6 diphosphatase (FDpase), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) as gluconeogenic enzymes were significantly affected by the moluscicidal plants. In addition, some other parameters as glycogen, glucose, total protein, 5-nucleotidase alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) as kreb's cycle enzyme were tested. As conclusion, LC25 and LC50 concentrations of C. spinosa and A. arabica might render B. alexandrina physiologically unsuitable for S. mansoni infection.
