Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the red cell aging process on insulin receptor binding. In erythrocytes from 8 children with high reticulocyte count and 9 healthy age-matched subjects we studied insulin receptor binding in correlation with pyruvate kinase (PK) activity and creatine levels. Moreover maximum 125I-insulin bound % and PK activity were tested in four red cell fractions of different age. Our data show a significant correlation between 125I-insulin bound and either PK activity or creatine levels. In vitro experiments on red cell fractions of different age (as tested by creatine levels) evidence a lower decay of PK activity than insulin bound (p less than 0.05). Our results indicate that creatine content is the best marker of red cell age for insulin receptor studies.
