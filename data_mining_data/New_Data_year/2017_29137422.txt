Aerobic glycolysis is one of the most important common characteristics in both cancer cells and stem cells. Metabolism switch has been discovered as an important early event in the process of reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). As a rate limiting kinase in glycolysis, Pkm2 has been reported playing critical roles in many tumors, yet its role in stem cells and iPSCs induction is poorly defined. In the present study, we showed that Pkm2 is a predominant pyruvate kinase in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and its expression increases many pluripotent genes. During somatic cell reprogramming, up-regulation of Pkm2 can be observed and over-expression of Pkm2 can facilitate iPSCs induction, while Pkm1 or a mutant form of Pkm2 (Pkm2(K422R)) showed no enhancement role in iPSCs induction. Therefore, our data demonstrated that Pkm2 enhances the pluripotency maintenance in ESCs and promotes the pluripotency acquisition during somatic cell reprogramming.
