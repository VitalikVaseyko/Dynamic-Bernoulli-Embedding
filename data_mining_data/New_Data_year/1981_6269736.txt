Enzyme deviation patterns were examined in primary rat hepatomas induced by short-term sequential administration of two chemical carcinogens from among 2-fluorenylacetamide (FAA), diethylnitrosamine (DENA), and 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) or by FAA or 3'-Me-DAB followed by phenobarbital as a promoter. The purpose was to discern how the patterns are influenced by different administration schedules of carcinogens and which of the two carcinogens in the sequence affects the pattern more. Biochemical differentiation of hyperplastic hepatic nodules and hepatomas was determined by simultaneous assays of activities and isozyme composition of glucose-adenosine triphosphate phosphotransferase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase with consideration of histological classification of nodules and tumors. Poorly differentiated hepatomas were predominantly induced by 3'-Me-DAB followed by FAA or DENA except for hepatomas induced by 3'-Me-DAB followed by phenobarbital, which were mainly well and moderately differentiated; well and moderately differentiated hepatomas were predominantly induced by FAA followed by 3'-Me-DAB or phenobarbital. The degree of enzyme deviation of the hepatomas induced by DENA as the first carcinogen was intermediate between those of hepatomas induced by FAA or 3'-Me-DAB, although the degree tended to increase with increased dose or term of DENA. These results indicate that deviations of some enzymes, such as pyruvate kinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, as well as histological differentiation of the primary hepatomas are more strongly influenced by the first carcinogen than by the second under our administration schedules and that the degree of enzyme deviation shown by hepatomas produced by a particular carcinogen treatment regimen principally related to the potential of that regimen to induce the more anaplastic tumors.
