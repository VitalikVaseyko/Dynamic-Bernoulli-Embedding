1. Glycerol has been used for the treatment of intracranial hypertension, cerebral oedema and glaucoma. Experimentally, intramuscular administration of hypertonic glycerol solution is used to produce acute renal failure. In this model, glycerol causes rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, resulting in the development of renal injury. The pathogenesis is thought to involve vascular congestion, the formation of casts and oxidative stress. However, the effect of glycerol itself independent of rhabdomyolysis has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of i.p. glycerol on some biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in the kidney of young rats. 2. Rats received 10 mL/kg, i.p., hypertonic glycerol solution (50% v/v) or saline (NaCl 0.85 g%) followed by 24 h water deprivation. Twenty-four hours after the administration of glycerol, rats were killed. Creatinine levels and the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined in the plasma. In addition, CK, pyruvate kinase and LDH activity and oxidative stress parameters (free radical formation, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation) were measured in renal tissue. 3. Glycerol did not alter plasma CK activity and increased plasma creatinine levels, suggesting renal insufficiency and the absence of rhabdomyolysis. Renal CK and pyruvate kinase activity was decreased, suggesting diminution of energy homeostasis in the kidney. Plasma and renal LDH activity was decreased, whereas the formation of free radicals, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation were increased, suggesting oxidative stress. 4. These results are similar to those described after the intramuscular administration of glycerol. Therefore, it is possible that glycerol may provoke renal lesions by mechanisms other than those induced by rhabdomyolysis.
