Metabolic changes during the first 24 hours of starvation were studied in rats previously adapted for 3 weeks during the postweaning growth period to a low-protein diet using lactalbumin as a dietary protein source. Previous adaptation to a high-quality, low-protein diet reduced the effects of early starvation on the loss of body and liver weight. In rats fed a low-protein diet (6% lactalbumin, LP rats), free triiodothyronine (T3) concentration remained higher than in control rats (13% lactalbumin, C rats) throughout the experiment (+38%, 24 hours), and the plasma insulin concentration, which was lower than in C rats during the first 6 hours (-56%), was not different thereafter. Plasma insulin to glucagon molar ratio was lower (-54%) and liver cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration was higher (+28%) in LP than in C rats in the fed state, but these were not different at 24 hours of starvation. Plasma glucose concentration was slightly lower in LP than in C rats (-15%) in the fed state, but it was not different in both groups during starvation. Whereas they were unchanged in the fed state, plasma lactate concentration was lower (-57%) and free fatty acid and total ketone body concentrations were higher (+38% and +183%, respectively) in LP than in C rats at 24 hours of starvation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
