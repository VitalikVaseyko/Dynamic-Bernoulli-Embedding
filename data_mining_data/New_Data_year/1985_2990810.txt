The specific activities of glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were all higher in the synaptoplasmic fraction from rat brain than in 100,000 g supernatant fraction of rat brain homogenates when the supernatants were prepared in high ionic strength solutions. Four enzymes in synaptosomes and two enzymes in homogenates were associated with particulate fractions as indicated by the large increase in specific activity of the enzymes when samples were treated with 0.3 M KCl before centrifugation. Glucosephosphate isomerase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were the enzymes that showed a large increase in specific activity following salt treatment of isolated, synaptosomal membrane while aldolase and pyruvate kinase were the two enzymes which showed a large increase in specific activity in the high speed supernatant fractions. Because the specific activities of many enzymes are found to be elevated not only in synaptosomes but in synaptosomal membrane fractions it is suggested that these enzymes may provide the potential for significantly enhanced glycolysis at these locations.
