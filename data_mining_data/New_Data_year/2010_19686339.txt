Yeasts have evolved numerous responsive pathways to survive in fluctuating and stressful environments. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is sensitive to adverse conditions, which are detected by response pathways to ensure correct protein folding. Calnexin is an ER transmembrane chaperone acting in both quality control of folding and response to persistent stress. Calnexin is a key protein required for viability in certain organisms such as mammals and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nevertheless, S. pombe calnexin-independent (Cin) cells were obtained after transient expression of a particular calnexin mutant. The Cin state is dominant, is stably propagated by an epigenetic mechanism and segregates in a non-Mendelian fashion to the meiotic progeny. The nucleolar protein Cif1p was identified as an inducer of the Cin state in a previous genetic screen. Here, we report the identification of novel inducers isolated in an overexpression genetic screen: pyruvate kinase (Pyk1p) and phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p). Addition of pyruvate, the end product of pyruvate kinase and glycolysis, also induced calnexin independence in a dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, growth in respiration media or cold temperatures induced the appearance of Cin cells at high frequencies. Taken together, our results indicate that the Cin state can be triggered by extracellular changes, suggesting that this state represents an epigenetic adaptative response to environmental modifications.
