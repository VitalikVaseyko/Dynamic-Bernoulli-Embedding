Intracellular localization of D-glycerate dehydrogenase (D-glycerate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.29), one of the enzymes of the pathway for gluconeogenesis from serine via hydroxypyruvate, was studied by differential centrifugation. Almost all enzyme activity was found in cytosol. Since the major activities of two other enzymes, serine: pyruvate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.51) and glycerate kinase (ATP: D-glycerate 2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.31), of the pathway via hydroxypyruvate are localized in mitochondrial inner membrane and/or matrix, the possible localization of D-glycerate dehydrogenase in mitochondria was examined. Detailed analysis of mitochondrial fraction prepared by differential centrifugation indicated that rat liver mitochondria do not contain any D-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. Based on these results, a cooperative connection between mitochondria and cytosol in gluconeogenesis from serine via hydroxypyruvate is proposed. Possible mechanisms for transport of intermediates of the pathway via hydroxypyruvate across the mitochondrial membranes are also discussed.
