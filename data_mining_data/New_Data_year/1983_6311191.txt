The rates of loss of adenylate kinase and creatine kinase from the circulation after intravenous injection of homogenous chicken skeletal muscle enzymes were examined to determine the role of plasma clearance rates in determining the plasma levels of these enzymes in normal and dystrophic chickens. The rapid clearance of adenylate kinase activity (average half-life of 5 min) and the slower biphasic clearance of creatine kinase activity (average half-lives of 0.95 and 11 hr) are consistent with the elevation of creatine kinase but not adenylate kinase in the blood plasma of dystrophic chickens compared to normal chickens. The rates of clearance of these enzymes were similar in normal chickens compared to dystrophic chickens. Radioiodinated enzymes were cleared at similar, but slightly more rapid rates than the loss of enzyme activity. The loss of adenylate kinase activity from the circulation may be due in part to inactivation since adenylate kinase activity is rapidly inactivated in serum in vitro, and because no increase in adenylate kinase activity is observed in the most specific sites of clearance of the radioiodinated enzyme, the liver and spleen. The comparison of enzyme activities in press juices to the activities in high-ionic-strength homogenates of muscle tissue from normal and dystrophic muscle, indicates that adenylate kinase activity is not associated with intracellular structures to the extent that would prohibit release from dystrophic muscle tissue. These results, and those presented previously with regard to plasma levels and clearance rates of AMP aminohydrolase and pyruvate kinase in normal and dystrophic chickens (11) support our hypothesis that the rates of loss of muscle enzyme activities from the circulation are important in determining the circulating levels of muscle enzymes in dystrophic chickens. Furthermore, from the measurement of plasma levels and clearance rates of creatine kinase, it was estimated that the efflux rate of creatine kinase from dystrophic muscle tissue is 2.0% of the total breast muscle creatine kinase per day.
