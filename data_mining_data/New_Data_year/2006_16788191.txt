The filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 can fix N(2) when combined nitrogen is not available in the growth medium. It has a family of 13 genes encoding proteins with both a Ser/Thr kinase domain and a His kinase domain. The function of these enzymes is unknown. Two of them are encoded by pkn41 (alr0709) and pkn42 (alr0710). These two genes are separated by only 72 bp on the chromosome, and our results indicate that they are cotranscribed. The expression of pkn41 and pkn42 is induced by iron deprivation irrespective of the nature of the nitrogen source. Mutants inactivating either pkn41, pkn42, or both grow similarly to the wild type under normal conditions, but their growth is impaired either in the presence of an iron chelator or under conditions of nitrogen fixation and iron limitation, two situations where the demand for iron is particularly strong. Consistent with these results, these mutants display lower iron content than the wild type and a higher level of expression for nifJ1 and nifJ2, which encode pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductases. Both nifJ1 and nifJ2 are known to be induced by iron limitation. NtcA, a global regulatory factor for different metabolic pathways, binds to the putative promoter region of pkn41, and the induction of pkn41 in response to iron limitation no longer occurs in an ntcA mutant. Our results suggest that ntcA not only regulates the expression of genes involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism but also coordinates iron acquisition and nitrogen metabolism by activating the expression of pkn41 and pkn42.
