Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome. Although NAFLD is a major cause of cirrhosis and cancer of the liver of unknown cause, no established pharmacological treatment for NAFLD has been established yet. It has been reported that leptin treatment improved fatty liver dramatically as well as insulin resistance and hyperphagia in patients with lipodystrophy. However, it is unclear whether leptin improves fatty liver independently of these metabolic improvements. We investigated the liver effect of leptin independently of insulin sensitization and appetite suppression using hepatocyte-specific Pten-deficient (AlbCrePtenff) mouse, a model of severe fatty liver with insulin hypersensitivity. Male AlbCrePtenff mice were infused subcutaneously with leptin (20 ng/g/h) for 2 weeks using osmotic minipumps. Leptin infusion effectively reduced liver weight, liver triglyceride content, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) concentrations as well as food intake and body weight without the change of plasma insulin concentration in AlbCrePtenff mice. Pair-feeding also reduced body weight but not liver triglyceride content. Pair feeding reduced alpha1 and alpha2 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities and PGC1alpha gene expression in the liver, while leptin infusion unchanged them. The present study clearly demonstrated that leptin improve fatty liver independently of insulin sensitization and suppression of food intake. It was suggested that leptin improves fatty liver by stimulation of beta-oxidation in the liver. The present study might provide a further understanding on the mechanism of metabolic effect of leptin.
