OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of haemoglobin (Hb) variants and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in Rwanda. METHODS: During a two-month period in 2005, 987 cord blood samples were obtained in two hospitals in Kigali and Butare, Rwanda. Screening for sickle cell disorders, other Hb disorders, G6PD deficiency and other rare erythroenzymopathy deficiencies was done using isoelectric focusing techniques and quantitative kinetic assays, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of Hb S trait was 2.7% and that of G6PD deficiency was 3.8%. No neonate suffered from a sickle cell disease (homozygous for Hb S or compound heterozygous for Hb S), from another clinically significant haemoglobinopathy, or from pyruvate kinase or glucose phosphate isomerase deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Sickle cell disorders should be considered a public health problem in Kigali and Butare. A systematic neonatal screening programme for those disorders, and to diagnose G6PD deficiency, seems reasonable, but local health priorities must be considered. Adapted management of hereditary sickle cell and G6PD disorders should be available.
