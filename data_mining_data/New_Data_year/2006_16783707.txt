Deficiencies of enzymes involved in erythrocyte metabolism can have significant effects on erythrocyte function and survival. Animals with pyruvate kinase (PK) or phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiencies have shortened erythrocyte life spans and regenerative anemia. PK-deficient dogs (but not PK-deficient cats) develop progressive myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis of bone marrow and hemochromatosis and cirrhosis of the liver. PFK-deficient dogs have sporadic episodes of hyperventilation-induced intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Cytochrome b5 reductase (Cb5R) deficiency in dogs and cats results in persistent methemoglobinemia and cyanotic mucous membranes. Severe deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-controlling enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, resulted in anemia with eccentrocytosis in an American saddlebred colt. Horses with erythrocyte flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) deficiency have both eccentrocytosis (attributable to severe deficiency in glutathione reductase activity) and methemoglobinemia (attributable to Cb5R deficiency); the dual enzyme deficiency occurs because FAD is a required cofactor for both enzymes. Erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies do not usually shorten life expectancy, except for PK-deficient dogs and potentially PFK-deficient dogs during a hemolytic crisis. Although enzyme deficiencies are rare causes of anemia and methemoglobinemia, the ability to diagnose deficient animals allows for the possibility of eliminating these undesirable traits in future breeding. DNA-based assays are available for PK and PFK deficiencies; whereas, biochemical tests of enzyme activity are required for other deficiencies. Continued research is needed to document additional enzyme deficiencies that likely occur and to develop additional DNA-based assays to detect heterozygous animals.
