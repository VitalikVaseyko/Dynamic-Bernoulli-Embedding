The amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 formed during proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in the development or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other pathologies associated with formation of protein aggregates in the central nervous system. Recent proteomic profiling of mouse and rat brain preparations by means of beta-amyloid peptide immobilized on Affigel-10 revealed a large group of amyloid-binding proteins (n>80). Many (about 25%) of these proteins were previously identified as isatin-binding proteins. The aim of this study was to validate direct interaction between beta-amyloid peptide and highly purified intact and oxidized peroxiredoxin, M-type pyruvate kinase, alpha-enolase, and the effect of isatin on this interaction. The study performed using SPR-based Biacore 3000 and Biacore X100 biosensors has shown that all the proteins form molecular complexes with immobilized beta-amyloid peptide. The Kd values for these complexes varied from 8.36small ha, Cyrillic10-8 M (peroxiredoxin) to 1.97small ha, Cyrillic10-6 M (alpha-enolase). Oxidative modification of investigated proteins caused opposite effects on complexes of these peptides with beta-amyloid. The endogenous neuroprotector isatin increased dissociation of complexes formed by beta-amyloid peptide with both intact proteins (peroxiredoxin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and/or oxidized proteins (peroxiredoxin, pyruvate kinase) used in this study.
