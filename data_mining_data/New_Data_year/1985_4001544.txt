The specific activity of pyruvate kinase in mussel foot is markedly higher than that from mantle and digestive gland. The foot enzyme shows maximum pH activity in the range between 7.0 and 7.5 and is stable (15 min, 37 degrees C) at pH values between 7.0 and 9.0. The activation energy value is 23 kJ/mol with a Q10 coefficient of 1.4. All of these experiments were carried out using partially purified extracts with (NH4)2SO4 treatment (30-60%) and posterior dialysis with EDTA 1.2 mM. No isoenzymatic forms could be detected using the column chromatography techniques with Sephadex G-150, DEAE Sephadex A-50 and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
