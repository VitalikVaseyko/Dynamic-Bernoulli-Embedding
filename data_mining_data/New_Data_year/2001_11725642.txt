The gene for pyruvate kinase, which is involved in glycolysis and catalyze the biochemical reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, was screened, cloned and sequenced from non-photosynthetic Oomycetes, Achlya bisexualis cDNA library. The size of the gene is about 1.6 kb. The amino acid sequence of the gene was deduced using the GCG program. On basis of analysis by the on-line PSORT II program the deduced amino acid sequence showed that the pyruvate kinase expressed by the gene was located in the cytosol. This result indicated that it is possible that the process of glycolysis for the lower form of eukaryotic cell such as Achlya bisexuali may occur in cytosol, which is different from Liaud's report.
