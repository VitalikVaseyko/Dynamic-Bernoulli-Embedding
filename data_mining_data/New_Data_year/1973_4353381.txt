1. The effects of Ca(2+) on the activities and regulatory properties of trehalase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose diphosphatase and pyruvate kinase from vertebrate red and white muscle and insect fibrillar and non-fibrillar muscle have been investigated. These muscles were selected because of the possible difference in the role of glycolysis in energy production in the vertebrate muscles, and the possible difference in the role of Ca(2+) in the control of contraction in the two types of insect muscle. An increase in Ca(2+) concentration from 0.001mum to 10mum did not modify the activities nor did it modify the regulatory properties of these enzymes from these various muscles. 2. Concentrations of Ca(2+) above 0.1mm inhibited the activities of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase from the different muscles. It has been suggested that this inhibition may provide the basis for a theory of regulation of glycolysis (Margreth et al., 1967). If phosphofructokinase is located within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, its activity will be inhibited when the muscle is at rest, but the release of Ca(2+) from the reticulum during contraction will lead to a stimulation of its activity and hence an increase in glycolytic flux. The distribution of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase in the various cell fractions of these muscles was very variable. In particular, both enzymes were present almost exclusively in the 100000g supernatant fraction in the extracts of insect flight muscles. Thus there is no correlation between the properties of the enzymes and their distribution in muscle. 3. It is concluded that Ca(2+) does not control the activities of the important regulatory enzymes of glycolysis in muscle. It is suggested that in some muscles the sensitivity of the control mechanism at the level of phosphofructokinase to changes in the concentration of AMP may be increased by a process known as ;substrate-cycling'.
