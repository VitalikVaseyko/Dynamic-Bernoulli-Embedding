Interactions of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9), aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate lyase, EC 4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12), triose-phosphate isomerase (D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1), phosphoglycerate mutase (D-phosphoglycerate 2,3-phosphomutase, EC 5.4.2.1), phosphoglycerate kinase (ATP:3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3), enolase (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydro-lyase, EC 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (ATP:Pyruvate O2-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) and lactate dehydrogenase [S)-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.27) with F-actin, among the glycolytic enzymes listed above, and with phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) were studied in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol). Both purified rabbit muscle enzymes and rabbit muscle myogen, a high-speed supernatant fraction containing the glycolytic enzymes, were used to study enzyme-F-actin interactions. Following ultracentrifugation, F-actin and poly(ethylene glycol) tended to increase and KCl to decrease the pelleting of enzymes. In general, the greater part of the pelleting occurred in the presence of both F-actin and poly(ethylene glycol) and the absence of KCl. Enzymes that pelleted more in myogen preparations than as individual purified enzymes in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) and the absence of F-actin were tested for specific enzyme-enzyme associations, several of which were observed. Such interactions support the view that the internal cell structure is composed of proteins that interact with one another to form the microtrabecular lattice.
