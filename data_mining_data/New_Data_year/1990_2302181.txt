1. Maximal activities of some key enzymes of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutaminolysis were measured in homogenates from a variety of normal, neoplastic and suppressed cells. 2. The relative activities of hexokinase and 6-phosphofructokinase suggest that, particularly in neoplastic cells, in which the capacity for glucose transport is high, hexokinase could approach saturation in respect to intracellular glucose; consequently, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase could play an important role in the regulation of glycolytic flux in these cells. 3. The activity of pyruvate kinase is considerably higher in tumorigenic cells than in non-tumorigenic cells and higher in metastatic cells than in tumorigenic cells: for non-tumorigenic cells the activities range from 28.4 to 574, for tumorigenic cells from 899 to 1280, and for metastatic cells from 1590 to 1627 nmol/min per mg of protein. 4. The ratio of pyruvate kinase activity to 2 x phosphofructokinase activity is very high in neoplastic cells. The mean is 22.4 for neoplastic cells, whereas for muscle from 60 different animals it is only 3.8. 5. Both citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities are present in non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells, suggesting that the full complement of tricarboxylic-acid-cycle enzymes are present in these latter cells. 6. In neoplastic cells, the activity of glutaminase is similar to or greater than that of hexokinase, which suggests that glutamine may be as important as glucose for energy generation in these cells.
