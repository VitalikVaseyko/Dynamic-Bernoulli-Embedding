The alpha-subunit of the E1 component of branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase is phosphorylated at 3 sites by an endogenous kinase. Inactivation of the complex correlates with rapid phosphorylation of one of these sites. The similarities with the covalent regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are discussed.
