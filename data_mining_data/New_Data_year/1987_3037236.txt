Glipizide raised, in a dose-dependent manner, the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in hepatocytes isolated from 24-hour fasted rats and incubated in the presence of 10 mmol/L glucose. Simultaneously, the rate of L-lactate production, as well as the rate of 3H2O formation from (3-3H)glucose, increased markedly. The concentration of glipizide calculated as corresponding to the half-maximal effect in these metabolic parameters was 12 to 15 mumol/L. In hepatocytes isolated from fed rats, either normal or made diabetic by treatment with alloxan, glipizide inhibited the conversion of both (U-14C)pyruvate and (U-14C)lactate to (14C)glucose; an inverse correlation was established between hepatocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels and the rate of gluconeogenesis. The increase of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration elicited by glipizide, which occurs without a significant modification of either 6-phospho-fructo 2-kinase activity or hepatocyte cyclic AMP levels, seems to be related to a significant accumulation of hexose 6-phosphates (glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate) in the hepatic cells.
