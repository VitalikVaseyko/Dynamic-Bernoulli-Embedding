An insulin mediator which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been purified approximately 1000-2000-fold from skeletal muscle. Following heat treatment, charcoal adsorption and Sephadex G-25 sieving, Sephadex G-15 sieving and HPLC over an anion exchange column were performed. The mediator has characteristics of a relatively low molecular weight peptide or derivatized peptide which acts on cAMP-dependent protein kinase but not on mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase.
