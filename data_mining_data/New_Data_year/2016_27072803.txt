Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a member of the HSP90 family, controls a variety of physiological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Most studies have been devoted to understanding the anti-apoptotic roles of TRAP1 in cancer and targeting it for tumor control in clinical settings. Additionally, we have identified a new role for TRAP1 in regulation of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in TRAP1 transgenic mice and cellular proliferation in TRAP1-overexpressing cells, via mitochondrial alterations. Moreover, recent works have indicated a role for TRAP1 in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) as well as a metabolic switch between mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysis called as "Warburg effect." This review discusses the implications of TRAP1 action for both metabolism and the regulation of CSCs.
