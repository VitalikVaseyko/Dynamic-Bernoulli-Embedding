In liver, through the reaction catalysed by alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alanine becomes an effective precursor for gluconeogenesis. In the present study amino-oxyacetate (AOA) was used to evaluate its effect on liver ALT activity of the carnivorous fish Sparus aurata. Moreover, the derived metabolic effects on metabolites and other key enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway were also studied. A dose-effect-dependent inhibition of AOA on hepatic cytosolic and mitochondrial ALT activity was observed in vitro. In vivo, AOA behaved as an inhibitor of hepatic cytosolic ALT activity. A long-term exposure to AOA increased pyruvate kinase activity in the liver irrespective of the composition of the diet supplied to fish. 1H NMR studies showed that inclusion of AOA to the diet decreased the hepatic levels of alanine, glutamate and glycogen. Moreover, 2H NMR analysis indicated a higher renewal rate for alanine in the liver of fish fed with a high-carbohydrate/low-protein diet, while AOA decreased alanine 2H-enrichment irrespective of the diet. The present study indicates that AOA-dependent inhibition of the cytosolic ALT activity could help to increase the use of dietary carbohydrate nutrients.
