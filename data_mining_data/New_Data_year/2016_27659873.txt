Cytokines induce cell proliferation or growth suppression depending on the context. It is increasingly becoming clear that success of standard radiotherapy and/or chemotherapeutics to eradicate solid tumors is dependent on IFN signaling. In this review we discuss the molecular mechanisms of tumor growth suppression by a gene product isolated in our laboratory using a genome-wide expression knock-down strategy. Gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality -19 (GRIM-19) functions as non-canonical tumor suppressor by antagonizing oncoproteins. As a component of mitochondrial respiratory chain, GRIM-19 influences the degree of "Warburg effect" in cancer cells as many advanced and/or aggressive tumors show severely down-regulated GRIM-19 levels. In addition, GRIM-19 appears to regulate innate and acquired immune responses in mouse models. Thus, GRIM-19 is positioned at nodes that favor cell protection and/or prevent aberrant cell growth.
