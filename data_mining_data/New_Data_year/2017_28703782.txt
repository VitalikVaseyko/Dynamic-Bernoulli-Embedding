The mortality and morbidity that characterize bladder cancer compel this malignancy into the category of hot topics in terms of biomolecular research. Therefore, a better knowledge of the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie the development and progression of bladder cancer is demanded. Tumor heterogeneity among patients with similar diagnosis, as well as intratumor heterogeneity, generates difficulties in terms of targeted therapy. Furthermore, late diagnosis represents an ongoing issue, significantly reducing the response to therapy and, inevitably, the overall survival. The role of non-coding RNAs in bladder cancer emerged in the last decade, revealing that microRNAs (miRNAs) may act as tumor suppressor genes, respectively oncogenes, but also as biomarkers for early diagnosis. Regarding other types of non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are extensively reviewed in this article, their exact roles in tumorigenesis are-for the time being-not as evident as in the case of miRNAs, but, still, clearly suggested. Therefore, this review covers the non-coding RNA expression profile of bladder cancer patients and their validated target genes in bladder cancer cell lines, with repercussions on processes such as proliferation, invasiveness, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and other molecular pathways which are specific for the malignant transformation of cells.
