Pyruvate kinase of Streptococcus mutans JC 2 had an absolute and specific requirement for glucose-6-phosphate. Inorganic phosphate was a strong inhibitor. The enzyme required K+ or NH4+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+. S. mutans FIL and E 49, Streptococcus bovis ATCC 9809, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 had also glucose-6-phosphate-dependent pyruvate kinases, whereas Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904 had an enzyme activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
