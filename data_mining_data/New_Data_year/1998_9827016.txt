Activities of hexokinase (HK), glucokinase (GK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), were measured. The expression of GK mRNA was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in leukocytes (WBC) of dogs and cats. No significant differences between dogs and cats were found in concentrations of blood glucose and plasma insulin. Dog WBC showed GK activities and the specific fragment with predicted size of 574 bp containing conserved region including glucose- and ATP-binding domains of GK as determined with RT-PCR. However, in cat WBC, the activities and specific fragment of GK were absent. After fasting, the activities and gene expression of GK decreased greatly in the dog WBC. The cat WBC had significantly higher activities of HK and PK than dog WBC.
