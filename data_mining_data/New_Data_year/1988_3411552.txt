Individual blastocysts from cows were cultured for 3 h under 5% CO2 in air, in 4 microliters droplets of Ham's F-10 medium containing D-[5-3H]glucose, D-[1-14C]-glucose, D-[6-14C]glucose, [2-14C]pyruvate, or L-[U-14C]glutamine, and with or without 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or phenazine ethosulphate (PES). The 14CO2 or 3H2O produced were collected by exchange with an outer bath of 400 microliter 25 mM-NaHCO3. All combinations of substrate and treatment (control, DNP or PES) produced measurable quantities of labelled product except for D-[6-14C]glucose in the presence of PES. Untreated and DNP-treated embryos developed normally during a subsequent 48-h culture period in fresh medium, but PES-treated embryos degenerated. Pyruvate and glutamine metabolism both increased markedly in the presence of DNP, indicating that the Krebs' cycle is active, and that glutamine can be used as an energy substrate. Conversely, DNP has no significant effect on glucose metabolism, indicating that glycolysis is blocked in the bovine blastocyst due to a lack or inhibition of pyruvate kinase. The production of 14CO2 from D-[1-14C]glucose increased significantly in the presence of PES, indicating that the activity of the pentose shunt is less than maximal.
