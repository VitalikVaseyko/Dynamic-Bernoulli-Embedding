According to the World Health Organization, around 20% of all cancers would be due to environmental factors. Among these factors, several chemicals are indeed well recognized carcinogens. The widespread contaminant benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), an often used model carcinogen of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons' family, has been suggested to target most, if not all, cancer hallmarks described by Hanahan and Weinberg. It is classified as a group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer; however, the precise intracellular mechanisms underlying its carcinogenic properties remain yet to be thoroughly defined. Recently, the pH homeostasis, a well known regulator of carcinogenic processes, was suggested to be a key actor in both cell death and Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming induced upon B[a]P exposure. The present review will highlight those data with the aim of favoring research on the role of H(+) dynamics in environmental carcinogenesis.
