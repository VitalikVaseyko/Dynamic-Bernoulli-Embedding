pH profiles have been determined for the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate kinase between pyruvate and MgATP and between phosphoenolpyruvate and MgADP. V, V/KMgATP, and V/Kpyruvate all decrease below a pK of 8.3 and above one of 9.2. The group with pK = 8.3 is probably a lysine that removes the proton from pyruvate during enolization, while the pK of 9.2 is that of water coordinated to enzyme-bound Mg2+. The fact that this pK shows in all three pH profiles shows that pyruvate forms a predominantly second sphere complex and cannot replace hydroxide to form the inner sphere complex that results in enolization and subsequent phosphorylation. On the basis of the displacement of the pK of the acid-base catalytic group in its V/K profile, phosphoenolpyruvate is a sticky substrate, reacting to give pyruvate approximately 5 times faster than it dissociates. The V/K profile for the slow substrate phosphoenol-alpha-ketobutyrate shows the pK of 8.3 for the acid-base catalytic group in its correct position, but this group must be protonated so that it can donate a proton to the intermediate enolate following phosphoryl transfer. The secondary phosphate pK of the substrate is seen in this V/K profile as well as in the pKi profile for phosphoglycolate (but not in those for glycolate O-sulfate or oxalate), showing a preference for the trianion for binding. The chemical mechanism with the natural substrates thus appears to involve phosphoryl transfer between MgADP and a Mg2+-bound enolate with metal coordination of the enolate serving to make it a good leaving group.
