8-bromo-ATP is a substrate of nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Its reactivity is similar to that of ATP, and the reaction appears to be unaffected by the different conformations of these two substrates. The nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction with 8-bromo-ATP cannot be monitored photometrically (optical test) using an NADH/NAD+-dependent enzyme system, because the product 8-bromo-ADP is not a substrate for pyruvate kinase. Measurements of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase reaction with 8-bromo-ATP therefore, were carried out by chromatographic analysis of the nucleoside-triphosphate/diphosphate ratio.
