The effects of synthetic preparations exhibiting cytokinin-like activity (6-benzylaminopurine, Thidiazuron, and kartolin-2) on the specific leaf area (SLA) were studied in plants of the family Gramineae (wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; meadow fescue, Festuca pratensis Huds.; and reed fescue, F. arindinacea Schreb.). At the early stages of ontogeny (until the leaf area reached 50-60% of the maximum value), treatment of plants of the three species with cytokinin-like preparations caused an increase in SLA. The SLA value in these plants was correlated with the rate of photosynthetic assimilation of carbon dioxide and activities of carbon metabolism enzymes: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39), NAD-malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), and NADP-glyceraldehydrophosphate dehydrogenase complex, which includes phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3) and glyceraldehydrophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13). However, there was no correlation of SLA with the activity of phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31), an anaplerotic carboxylation enzyme of grasses. SLA is suggested to reflect the state and activity of the photosynthetic apparatus and can be recommended as a characteristic of photosynthesis variability (e.g., caused by cytokinin-like preparations).
