Rainbow trout have a limited ability to use dietary carbohydrates efficiently and are considered to be glucose intolerant. Administration of carbohydrates results in persistent hyperglycemia and impairs post-prandial down regulation of gluconeogenesis despite normal insulin secretion. Since gluconeogenic genes are mainly under insulin control, we put forward the hypothesis that the transcriptional function of insulin as a whole may be impaired in the trout liver. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed intraperitoneal administration of bovine insulin to fasted rainbow trout and also subjected rainbow trout primary hepatocytes to insulin and/or glucose stimulation. We demonstrate that insulin was able to activate Akt, a key element in the insulin signaling pathway, and to regulate hepatic metabolism-related target genes both in vivo and in vitro. In the same way as in mammals, insulin decreased mRNA expression of gluconeogenic genes, including glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Insulin also limited the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), a limiting enzyme of fatty acid beta-oxidation. In vitro studies revealed that, as in mammals, glucose is an important regulator of some insulin target genes such as the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS). Interestingly, glucose also stimulates expression of glucokinase (GK), which has no equivalent in mammals. This study demonstrates that insulin possesses the intrinsic ability to regulate hepatic gene expression in rainbow trout, suggesting that other hormonal or metabolic factors may counteract some of the post-prandial actions of insulin.
