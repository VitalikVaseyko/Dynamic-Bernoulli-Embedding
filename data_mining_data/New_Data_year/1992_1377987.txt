We have previously demonstrated that the low number of interleukin-4 receptors (IL-4Rc) on HL-60 leukemia cells render this population susceptible to differentiation by IL-4. As it occurs with normal human monocytes, IL-4 induces the expression of HLA-DR surface antigens on HL-60 cells as well. The second messenger pathway(s) involved after the IL-4 stimulation leading to class II up-regulation has not been fully examined. Here we show that IL-4-induced class II antigen expression on the HL-60 cell line or normal human monocytes is calcium/calmodulin-independent since theophylline (TPH, a calmodulin inhibitor) does not block the IL-4 effect. In addition, the pyruvate kinase C (PKC) pathway does not seem to participate in the process either because in our system activation of PKC by 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) is insufficient by itself to induce HLA-DR. We found, however, that a second messenger pathway can be mediated by a G protein system since IL-4 concomitantly induces class II and p21ras expression which can be successfully blocked by a highly specific anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody. In addition, using another p21ras inducer, the 5-azacytidine C (5-AzaC), we showed that this agent can also induce the expression of p21ras and class II, both of which can be inhibited by the same antibody. Thus, it appears that IL-4 selects the G protein system as a signaling pathway in order to exert its action for the induction of HLA-DR on human normal monocytes or M2 leukemia target cells. Since monocytes and macrophages participate in virtually all immune reactions, the regulation of class II induction is of obvious importance.
