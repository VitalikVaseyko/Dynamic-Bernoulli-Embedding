The bifunctional imidoester dimethyl suberimidate hydrochloride can stabilize rat red blood cells (RBCs) by membrane protein crosslinking, and in that way they can be used as carrier systems for exogenous substances. Counter-current distribution fractionation in charge-sensitive dextran-polyethyleneglycol two-phase systems has been used to detect slight changes in surface charge in stabilized cells. A decrease in the surface charge of crosslinked RBCs and an apparent masking of the age-related cell surface properties have been found to result from the protein crosslinking. Digitonin treatment used to permeabilize crosslinked RBCs produces a significant decrease of the cell surface charge while the age-related surface properties do not seem to be modified by the treatment.
