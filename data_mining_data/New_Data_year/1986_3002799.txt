cDNA clones, containing the entire coding region of rat L-type pyruvate kinase, were isolated and their nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy-chain-termination method. The predicted coding region, which spans 543 amino acids, established the complete amino acid sequence of the L-type isozyme of pyruvate kinase for the first time. The deduced amino acid sequence of the L type has one phosphorylation site in its amino terminus and shows about 68% and 48% homologies with M1-type pyruvate kinase of chicken and yeast pyruvate kinase respectively. Domain A exhibits higher homology than domains B and C. The residues in the active site of the L-type enzyme of rats, lying between domains B and A2, are rather different from those of the M1-type enzyme of chickens, but other residues constituting the active site are identical with those of the chicken M1 type except for one amino acid substitution.
