Livers of genetically obese (fa/fa) rats, starved for 24 h, contained more fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and glycogen, and more pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase 2 activities, than livers of control lean rats. These changes may be explained in terms of cyclic AMP concentration, which was decreased in livers of obese starved rats.
