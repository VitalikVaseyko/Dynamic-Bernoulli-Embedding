The effect of diet on the desaturation of linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid by liver microsomal preparations, on blood glucose and insulin levels, and on activities of glucokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase have been studied. The female rats used in these experiments were maintained on one of the following dietary regimes: (a) fasted, (b) fasted for 96 hr and refed glucose, (c) balanced diet, (d) carbohydrate-free diet, (e) lipid-free diet, or (f) protein-free diet. Fasting for 96 hr caused a decrease of both linoleic acid desaturation and glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activity together with a slight decrease of the blood insulin level. Alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was not modified. Refeeding of glucose for 50 hr increased the conversion of linoleic acid to linolenic acid as well as the activities of all the enzymes studied except alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The increase in desaturation, however, was transient. The feeding of a lipid-free diet did not modify the tested parameters. Feeding a carbohydrate-free diet for 96 hr resulted in increased linoleic acid desaturation but decreased glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, thus apparently eliminating a putative correlation between the fatty acid desaturating activity and glycolytic activity or blood insulin levels under these experimental conditions. The findings suggest that dietary proteins may play an important role in determining the level of fatty acid desaturation.
