Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor required for cellular adaptation to hypoxia, although its physiological roles and activation mechanisms during normoxia have not been studied sufficiently. The Warburg effect, which is a hallmark of malignant tumors that is characterized by increased activity of aerobic glycolysis, accompanies activation of HIF-1 during normoxia. Besides tumor cells that have multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, normal macrophages also use glycolysis for ATP production by depending upon elevated HIF-1 activity even during normoxia. We recently found that activity of factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) is specifically suppressed in macrophages by a nonproteolytic activity of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP-14). Thus, MT1-MMP expressed in macrophages plays a significant role in regulating HIF-1 activity during normoxia. In the light of this finding, we examined here whether MT1-MMP contributes to the Warburg effect of tumor cells. All the tumor cell lines that express MT1-MMP exhibit increased glycolytic activity, and forced expression of MT1-MMP in MT1-MMP-negative tumor cells is sufficient to induce the Warburg effect. The cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP mediates the stimulation of aerobic glycolysis by increasing the expression of HIF-1 target genes. Specific intervention of the MT1-MMP-mediated activation of HIF-1 in tumor cells retarded tumor growth in mice. Systemic administration of a membrane-penetrating form of the cytoplasmic tail peptide in mice to inhibit HIF-1 activation competitively also exhibited a therapeutic effect on tumors.
