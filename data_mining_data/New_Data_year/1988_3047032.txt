Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase in isolated rat pancreatic islets were shown to be regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. Broad-specificity phosphoprotein phosphatase treatment stimulated and ATP addition inhibited their activities. The kinases responsible for inactivating these complexes were shown to be sensitive to inhibition by known inhibitors, alpha-chloroisocaproate and dichloroacetate. Total activity (nmol/min/islet / 37 degrees C) of branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase was 0.86 and 5.09, with a % active form (activity before phosphatase treatment divided by activity after phosphatase treatment X 100) of 36% and 94%, respectively. Incubation of intact isolated islets with alpha-chloroisocaproate affected neither insulin release nor flux through branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase.
