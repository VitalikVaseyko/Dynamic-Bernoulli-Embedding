Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate-oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), aldolase (ALD), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD) activities were determined before, throughout the incubation period, and during the course of a viral-induced diarrhea in the neonatal calf. Hypoglycemia with a glucose concentration less than 40 mg/dl of plasma was observed in 3 of 10 calves. Plasma lactate concentration increased to 1.84 plus or minus 0.1 times normal in 7 and 6 to 7 times normal in 2 of the animals. The major change in both glucose and lactate concentrations during diarrhea occurred during the 24 hours preceding death. Changes in SGPT, SGOT, or AP activities were not observed, indicating the absence of marked hepatic damage. The ALD, CPK, and HBD activities were increased in 2 calves and the CPK alone was increased in 2 others, indicating cardiac and possibly skeletal muscle damage.
