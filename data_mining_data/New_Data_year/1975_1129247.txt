Two isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase--PK-1 and PK-2 were obtained from the cortical layer of rabbit kidney by the method of chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Starvation of rabbits for 10--16 days and alloxan diabetes produced no significant changes in the specific activity of PK in the soluble fraction obtained from the cortical layer of rabbit kidney. However, there were significant shifts in the isoenzymatic spectrum of the PK of the kidneys in rabbits with alloxan diabetes: the activity of the PK-1 increased considerably and significantly, and the isoenzyme PK-2 disappeared almost completely.
