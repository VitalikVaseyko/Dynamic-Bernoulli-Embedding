As part of the development of structured models for the metabolism of myeloma cells in suspension culture, a study was made of the subcellular localization of key enzymes of glucose and glutamine metabolism. Steady state chemostat cultures of the mouse myeloma SP2/0-Ag14 were used as a reproducible source of biomass. Homogenates of the cells, obtained via mechanical disruption, were separated into a mitochondrial and a cytosolic fraction via differential centrifugation. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) approximately one fifth of the hexokinase activity of cell-free homogenates is associated with the mitochondria; (2) a malate-aspartate shuttle may operate for oxidation of cytosolic NADH, as indicated by high levels of malate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase in both particulate and soluble fractions; (3) the pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase may contribute to the provision of cytosolic NADPH; (4) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate kinase, which are present in high activities, are exclusively cytosolic and probably play a key role in glutamine metabolism; (5) oxidation of glutamine via these enzymes leads to the formation of pyruvate that enters the same pool as pyruvate generated by glycolysis. As a result, lactate and alanine formation can occur from both glucose and glutamine.
