The activities of four glycolytic enzymes were measured in the lung homogenate of CFLP mice treated with a variety of carcinogens and non-carcinogens for mouse lung. The carcinogenic urethane, dimethylnitrosamine (DMNA), 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), benzo[a]pyrene (BP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and aflatoxin B1 enhanced the activity of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 28 days after a single intraperitoneal administration. These carcinogens also altered the ratio of LDH H and M subunits. In contrast, under the same conditions the non-carcinogenic phenylurethane, ethylformate, chrysene, perylene and pyrene, as well as the pulmonarily toxic Paraquat, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and cadmium chloride (CdCl2), did not influence either the activities of the enzymes tested or the isozyme pattern of LDH.
