Substantially high rate of glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is a well-known feature of cancers, and emerging evidence suggests that it supports cancerous proliferation/tumor growth. Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), a glycolytic enzyme, is commonly up-regulated in several cancers, and recent reports show its involvement in the Warburg effect. Here, a comprehensive analysis shows that PGAM is acetylated at lysines 100/106/113/138 in its central region, and a member of the Sirtuin family (class III deacetylase), SIRT2, is responsible for its deacetylation. Over-expression of SIRT2 or mutations at the acetylatable lysines of PGAM attenuates cancer cell proliferation with a concomitant decrease in PGAM activity. We also report that the acetyltransferase PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) interacts with PGAM and acetylates its C-terminus, but not the central region. As prior evidence suggests that SIRT2 functions as a tumor suppressor, our results would provide support for the mechanistic basis of this activity.
