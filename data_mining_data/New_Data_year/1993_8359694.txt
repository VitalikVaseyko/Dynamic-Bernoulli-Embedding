The pyruvate kinase-encoding gene (pki1) from Trichoderma reesei was isolated by hybridization to the corresponding Aspergillus nidulans pkiA gene. The 1614-bp nucleotide (nt) sequence of the cloned gene codes for a 538-amino-acid protein. The coding sequence contains a single intron of 246 nt at a position identical to that of intron E in the A. nidulans gene. The PKI protein shows extensive homology to the PKIs of A. nidulans and A. niger (67%) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (59%). The 5' non-coding sequence contains a number of motifs typical for yeast glycolytic genes, but so far only rarely found in filamentous fungi.
