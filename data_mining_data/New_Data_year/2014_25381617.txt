Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging using 9-aminoacridine as the matrix leads to the detection of low mass metabolites and lipids directly from cancer tissues. These included lactate and pyruvate for studying the Warburg effect, as well as succinate and fumarate, metabolites whose accumulation is associated with specific syndromes. By using the pathway information present in the human metabolome database, it was possible to identify regions within tumor tissue samples with distinct metabolic signatures that were consistent with known tumor biology. We present a data analysis workflow for assessing metabolic pathways in their histopathological context.
