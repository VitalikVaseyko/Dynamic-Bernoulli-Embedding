After 5 h of treatment with glucagon, liver L-type pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.40) showed a significant decrease of K0.5 and the Hill coefficient (nH) in the absence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. However, in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, liver enzymes from treated rats showed a slight decrease of K0.5 but nH remained unchanged. In both circumstances, no changes of Vmax were observed after treatment. These changes in the kinetic properties of liver L-type pyruvate kinase are consistent with the dephosphorylation of the enzyme caused by insulin release in response to treatment with glucagon.
