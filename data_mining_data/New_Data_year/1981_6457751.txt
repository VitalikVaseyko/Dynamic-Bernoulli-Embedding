Chinese hamster kidney epithelial-like cells derived from highly inbred nondiabetic (AV) and diabetic (XA) genetic sublines were passaged in medium containing 100 or 400 mg/dl glucose. The effect of high medium glucose on the activities of 5 enzymes involved in glucose metabolism was followed and significant glucose-dependent difference was observed. The effects, however, were opposite in cells derived from AV and XA sublines.
