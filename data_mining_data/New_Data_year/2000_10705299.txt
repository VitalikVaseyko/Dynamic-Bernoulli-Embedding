Using random arbitrarily primed-reverse transcribed-PCR and sequence analysis, we investigated changes in lymphocytic molecules after cell-cell contact with fibroblasts. An mRNA species which was upregulated in Jurkat T cells by cell-cell contact with MRHF cells (a human foreskin fibroblast line) was identified as coding for the human interleukin-17 receptor. This finding was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR for the HUT78 and Jurkat T cell lines, for peripheral blood lymphocytes, and for tonsillar T cells. Furthermore, the interleukin-17 mRNA, coding for a proinflammatory cytokine, was also upregulated in peripheral blood lymphocytes and tonsillar T cells after cell-cell contact with fibroblasts. Supernatants obtained from cell-cell contact-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes enhance the production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 by fibroblast-like synoviocytes and this effect could be blocked by interleukin-17 antibodies. Changes in the mRNA levels of Jurkat T cells induced by cell-cell contact with adherent cells were also found for M-type pyruvate kinase, for tropomyosin TM30 and for the p54nrb gene product.
