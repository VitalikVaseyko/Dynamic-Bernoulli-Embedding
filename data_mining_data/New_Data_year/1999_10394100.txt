The downstream signaling components of high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) were studied using yeast two-hybrid screening of the cDNA library constructed from RBL-2H3 cells. The cytoplasmic part of the gamma-chain but not that of the beta-chain was found to interact with pyruvate kinase in the yeast. The in-vitro-translated pyruvate kinase also specifically interacted with the bacterially expressed glutathione-S transferase fusion protein of the cytoplasmic part of the gamma-chain. When RBL-2H3 cells were challenged with antigen, the activity of pyruvate kinase gradually decreased, reaching the minimum activity around 5 min after the activation, and then slowly returned to the normal level. The dose-response curve (antigen vs. pyruvate kinase activity) plotted at 5 min after stimulation showed that the pyruvate kinase was dose-dependently inhibited and the maximum inhibition was reached at the concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml of antigen. Direct interaction between FcepsilonRI and pyruvate kinase was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation in RBL-2H3 cells. These data suggest that pyruvate kinase is functionally linked with FcepsilonRI and might exert an important role in controlling cellular functions following the activation of FcepsilonRI.
