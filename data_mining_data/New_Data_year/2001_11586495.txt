Rates of glucose uptake by epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue in vivo, as well as rates of hexose uptake and glycolytic flux in isolated adipocytes, were determined in rats adapted to a high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet and in control rats fed a balanced (N) diet. Adaptation to the HP diet induced a significant reduction in rates of glucose uptake, estimated with 2-deoxy-[1-(3)H]-glucose, both by adipose tissue (epididymal and retroperitoneal) in vivo and by isolated adipocytes. Twelve hours after replacement of the HP diet with the balanced diet, rates of adipose tissue uptake in vivo in HP-adapted rats returned to levels that did not differ significantly from those in N-fed rats. The rate of flux in the glycolytic pathway, estimated with (3)H[5]-glucose, was also significantly reduced in adipocytes from HP-fed rats. In agreement with the above findings, the activities of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), and pyruvate kinase (PK) were markedly reduced in adipose tissue from HP-adapted rats. The activity of pyruvate kinase was partially reverted by diet replacement for 12 hours. The low-plasma insulin and high-glucagon levels in HP-fed rats may have played an important role in the reduction of adipose tissue glucose utilization in these animals.
