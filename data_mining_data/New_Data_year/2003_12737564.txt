Alternative substrates for DNA and RNA polymerases offer an important set of biochemical tools. Many of the standard methods for nucleoside triphosphate synthesis fail in the cases of nonpurine and nonpyrimidine nucleosides. An efficient preparation of the 5'-O-tosylates for both the deoxy- and ribonucleosides enabled preparation of the diphosphate esters by displacement with tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate. Enzymatic synthesis of the azole carboxamide deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate was based on ATP as the phosphate donor, nucleoside diphosphate kinase as the catalyst, coupled with phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate kinase as an ATP regeneration system. Ribonucleoside triphosphate synthesis required PEP as the phosphate donor and pyruvate kinase as the catalyst. An optimized purification procedure based upon boronate affinity gel was developed to yield highly purified nucleoside triphosphates. The strategy outlined here provides a new and efficient method for preparation of nucleoside 5'-triphosphate and is likely applicable to a broad variety of base and sugar modified nucleoside analogues.
