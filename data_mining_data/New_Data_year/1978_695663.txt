The effect of 6-methylprednisolone (GCC) was studied on erythropoietin (ESF) levels and on the metabolic functions of erythrocytes (RBC). GCC (U mg/kg/day for 15 days) was administered to 6 patients with the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (group B) and to 6 patients with non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia due to hereditary pyruvate kinase enzyme deficiency (group C). 6 healthy persons served as control (group A). The metabolic functions of RBC were investigated by assaying HMPS activity, GSH/GSSG and lactate/pyruvate ratios, relevant glycolytic intermediates, 2,3-DPG, ATP, and key enzymes. A significant increase in ESF was observed in group B patients after GCC therapy, correlating with an improvement in the haemolytic state, and consequent rectification of the secondary disturbances of RBC metabolism. Group C patients already had raised ESF levels before GCC therapy; no further increase occured in response to treatment and no other clinical or haematological change was recorded. Hence, no harmonal influence of GCC on the disturbed RBC metabolic process was detectable in the cases.
