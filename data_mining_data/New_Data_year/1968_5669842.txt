1. The covalent attachment of pyruvate kinase to filter-paper disks and some kinetic properties of the resultant enzymically active porous sheets are described. 2. A two-enzyme reactor was constructed by using water-insoluble sheets of lactate dehydrogenease in conjunction with the above-mentioned sheets possessing pyruvate kinase activity.
