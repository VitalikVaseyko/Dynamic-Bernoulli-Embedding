The synteny of human mannose phosphate isomerase and pyruvate kinase and the assignment of the genes for these two enzymes to chromosome 15 were confirmed by analysis of 43 independently derived human-mouse hybrid clones. Hybrids between mouse cells deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and human fibroblasts carrying an X/15 chromosome translocation were also included in this study.
