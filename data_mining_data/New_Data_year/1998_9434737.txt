The crystal structure of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase complexed with Mn2+, K+, and pyruvate revealed a binding site of K+ [T. M. Larsen, L. T. Laughlin, H. M. Holden, I. Rayment, and G. H. Reed (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6301-6309]. Sequence comparisons of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and pyruvate kinases from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli, which do not exhibit a requirement for activation by monovalent cations, indicate that the only substitutions in the K+ binding site are conservative. Glu 117 in the rabbit muscle enzyme, which is close to the K+ site, is, however, replaced by Lys in these two bacterial pyruvate kinases. The proximity of Glu 117 to K+ in the structure of the rabbit enzyme and conservation of the binding site in the bacterial enzymes which lack a dependence on monovalent cations suggested that a protonated epsilon-amino group of Lys 117 in these bacterial enzymes may provide an "internal monovalent cation." Site-specific mutant forms of the rabbit enzyme corresponding to E117K, E117A, E117D, and E117K/K114Q pyruvate kinase were examined to test this hypothesis. The E117K pyruvate kinase exhibits 12% of the activity of the fully activated wild-type enzyme but is > 200-fold more active than the wild-type enzyme in the absence of activating monovalent cations. Moreover, the activity of E117K pyruvate kinase exhibits no stimulation by monovalent cations in the assay mixtures. Both E117A and E117D pyruvate kinases retain activation by monovalent cations but have reduced activities relative to wild type. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that pyruvate kinases that do not require activation by monovalent cations supply an internal monovalent cation in the form of a protonated epsilon-amino group of Lys. The results also support the assignment of the monovalent cation in the active site of pyruvate kinase.
