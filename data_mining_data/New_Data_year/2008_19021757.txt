Tyr235 of GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase is a fully invariant residue. The aromatic ring of this residue establishes an energetically favorable weak anion-quadrupole interaction with PEP carboxylate. The role of Tyr235 in catalysis was investigated via kinetic analysis of site-directed mutagenesis-derived variants. The Y235F change lowered the apparent K(m) for PEP by about six-fold, raised the apparent K(m) for Mn(2+) by about 70-fold, and decreased oxaloacetate (OAA)-forming activity by about 10-fold. These effects were due to an enhanced anion-quadrupole interaction between the aromatic side chain at position 235, which now lacked a hydroxyl group, and PEP carboxylate, which probably increased the distance between PEP and Mn(2+) and consequently affected the phosphoryl transfer step and overall catalysis. For the Y235A and Y235S changes, an elimination of the favorable edge-on interaction increased the apparent K(m) for PEP by four- and six-fold, respectively, and the apparent K(m) for Mn(2+) by eight- and six-fold, respectively. The pyruvate kinase-like activity, representing the PEP dephosphorylation step of the OAA-forming reaction, was affected by the substitutions in a similar way to the complete reaction. These observations indicate that the aromatic ring of Tyr235 helps to position PEP in the active site and the hydroxyl group allows an optimal PEP-Mn(2+) distance for efficient phosphoryl transfer and overall catalysis. The Y235A and Y235S changes drastically reduced the PEP-forming and OAA decarboxylase activities, probably due to the elimination of the stabilizing interaction between Tyr235 and the respective products, PEP and pyruvate.
