The synthesis of 8-thiocyano-ATP (CNS8-ATP) is described. At 37 degrees C the ATP analogue inactivates Na,K-ATPase, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase. In all three cases, inactivation can be prevented by the addition of ATP, thus indicating that CNS8-ATP is recognized within the ATP binding site of the above enzymes. Incubation of the inactivated enzymes with dithiothreitol restores the catalytic activities. Therefore, it is likely that in these enzymes a mixed disulfide (E-S-S8-ATP) is formed between a sulfhydryl in the ATP binding site (E-SH) and the ATP analogue: [formula: see text] From the pseudo-first-order inactivation kinetics, a KD = 2.7 microM with k2 = 0.142 min-1 is calculated for the hexokinase and a KD = 40 microM with k2 = 0.347 min-1 is calculated for the pyruvate kinase interactions with the ATP analogue. At 4 degrees C, Na,K-ATPase recognizes CNS8-ATP with a KD = 8.3 microM. At 37 degrees C, the enzyme becomes inactivated by the ATP analogue in a biphasic manner. Inactivation results in the incorporation of [alpha-32P]8-CNS8-ATP into the catalytic alpha-subunit of the enzyme. Limited tryptic digestion in the presence of 150 mM KCl results in the formation of a radioactive peptide of Mr = 56,000, known to bear the purine binding domain of Na,K-ATPase. The results described in this article verify CNS8-ATP as a sulfhydryl-reactive ATP analogue and characterize this new ATP analogue as a useful tool for structure/function studies on ATP-recognizing enzymes.
