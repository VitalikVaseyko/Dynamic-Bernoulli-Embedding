Pyruvate kinase activity is found in normozoospermic, oligozoospermic, azoospermic and vasectomised human seminal plasma. The split ejaculate technique was used to determine the origin of this enzyme. Sperm number, acid phosphatase activity and fructose concentrations were the control parameters to ensure proper collection. Evidence is presented that the prostate is the major source of pyruvate kinase in human seminal plasma.
