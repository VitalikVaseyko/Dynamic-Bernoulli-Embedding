SCOPE: SlimTrym((R)) is a formulated product composed of citrus polymethoxyflavones (PMFs), green tea extract, and lychee extract. We investigated the effect of dietary SlimTrym((R)) on diet-induced obesity and associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet (ND), high fat diet (HFD) or HFD containing 0.1% or 0.5% SlimTrym((R)) for 16 weeks. Dietary SlimTrym((R)) significantly reduced weight gain and relative perigonadal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric fat weight as well as the size of adipocyte in HFD-fed mice. SlimTrym((R)) supplementation also effectively diminished hepatic steatosis and the serum levels of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), triacylglycerol (TG), and total cholesterol (TCHO). Down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, and the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling by SlimTrym((R)) in both adipose tissue and liver may be responsible for the observed anti-obesity effects. CONCLUSION: SlimTrym((R)) supplementation potentially diminished diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis via regulating AMPK signaling and molecules involved in lipid metabolism.
