1. Changes in the concentrations of ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alanine, aspartate, malate, lactate, pyruvate, NAD(+), NADH and adenine nucleotides were measured in freeze-clamped rat liver during ischaemia. 2. Although the concentrations of most of the metabolites changed rapidly during ischaemia the ratios [glutamate]/[2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)] and [3-hydroxybutyrate]/[acetoacetate] changed equally and the value of the expression [3-hydroxybutyrate][2-oxoglutarate][NH(4) (+)]/[acetoacetate][glutamate] remained approximately constant, indicating that the 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase systems were at near-equilibrium with the mitochondrial NAD(+) couple. 3. The value of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] was about 0.7 in vivo and remained fairly constant during the ischaemic period of 5min, although the concentrations of alanine and oxoglutarate changed substantially. No explanation can be offered why the value of the ratio differed from that of the equilibrium constant of the alanine aminotransferase reaction, which is 1.48. 4. Injection of l-cycloserine 60min before the rats were killed increased the concentration of alanine in the liver fourfold and decreased the concentration of the other metabolites measured, except that of pyruvate. During ischaemia the concentration of alanine did not change but that of aspartate almost doubled. 5. After treatment with l-cycloserine the value in vivo of the expression [alanine][oxoglutarate]/[pyruvate][glutamate] rose from 0.7 to 2.4. During ischaemia the value returned to 0.8. 6. The effects of l-cycloserine are consistent with the assumption that it specifically inhibits alanine aminotransferase. 7. Most of the alanine formed during ischaemia is probably derived from pyruvate and from ammonia released by the deamination of adenine nucleotides and glutamine. The alanine is presumably formed by the combined action of glutamate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase. 8. The rate of anaerobic glycolysis, calculated from the increase in the lactate concentration, was 1.3mumol/min per g fresh wt. 9. Although the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides changed rapidly during ischaemia, the ratio [ATP][AMP]/[ADP](2) remained constant at 0.54, indicating that adenylate kinase established near-equilibrium under these conditions.
