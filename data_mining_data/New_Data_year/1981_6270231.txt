Activities of ten main metabolic pathway enzymes and seven lysosomal enzymes were determined in specimens from human normal palmar fascia and Dupuytren's contracture. The activities of the enzymes tested are 2-3 times higher in fresh specimens of Dupuytren's contracture. There are no differences in the activity distribution patterns of both these specimens, or in the absolute activities calculated in relation of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. With the exception of adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, the activities of main metabolic pathway enzymes based on the DNA content showed significantly lower activities in Dupuytren's contracture tissue than in palmar fascia. Lysosomal enzymes exhibit no significant differences of activity in the respective specimens. However, the lysosomal enzyme activities of cultured fibroblasts are lower than the corresponding activities from tissue specimens. The enzyme activities per DNA content in cultured fibroblasts are 10-50 times higher than in tissue specimens. The enzyme activities in cultured fibroblasts decrease with age or density of the cells in culture. The increased metabolic activity of the diseased tissues in Dupuytren's contracture is due to the higher cell content of the afflicted portions of the tissue, but individual enzymes show no qualitative changes in activity and there are no increases of enzyme activity per cell (DNA).
