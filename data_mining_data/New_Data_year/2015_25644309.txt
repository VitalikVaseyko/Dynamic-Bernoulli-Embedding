Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequently occurring cancers with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Amphiregulin (AREG), a member of the epidermal growth factor family and a rational target for CRC therapy, is essential for the three-dimensional structure of tumor formation. To clone the genes associated with increased AREG expression, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis in two CRC cell lines undergoing two-dimensional (2DC) and three-dimensional culture (3DC). Upregulated (>2.0-fold) and downregulated (<0.5-fold) genes in 3DC compared with 2DC were selected. Pathway analysis using DAVID based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases revealed a number of genes involved in glycolysis. In CRC cells, glucose elevated the expression of GLUT1 and AREG as well as the activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) luciferase reporter promoter. The suppression of AREG expression reduced the uptake of glucose and production of lactate. Luciferase assay identified a critical regulatory region for AREG expression between -130 and -180 bp upstream of the start site, which contained a carbohydrate response element (ChoRE). Max-like protein X (MLX) bound to ChoRE and enhanced the expression of AREG. Together these data suggest that AREG plays a pivotal role in the development of CRC through activation of the Warburg effect.
