1. The ;initial activity' of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex in whole tissue or mitochondrial extracts of lactating rat mammary glands was greatly decreased by 24 or 48h starvation of the rats. Injection of insulin and glucose into starved rats 60min before removal of the glands abolished this difference in ;initial activities'. 2. The ;total activity' of the enzyme complex in such extracts was revealed by incubation in the presence of free Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions (more than 10 and 0.1mm respectively) and a crude preparation of pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Starvation did not alter this ;total activity'. It is assumed that the decline in ;initial activity' of the enzyme complex derived from the glands of starved animals was due to increased phosphorylation of its alpha-subunit by intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. 3. Starvation led to an increase in intrinsic pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity in both whole tissue and mitochondrial extracts. Injection of insulin into starved animals 30min before removal of the lactating mammary glands abolished the increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity in whole-tissue extracts. 4. Pyruvate (1mm) prevented ATP-induced inactivation of the enzyme complex in mitochondrial extracts from glands of fed animals. In similar extracts from starved animals pyruvate was ineffective. 5. Starvation led to a decline in activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase in mitochondrial extracts, but not in whole-tissue extracts. 6. These changes in activity of the intrinsic kinase and phosphatase of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of lactating rat mammary gland are not explicable by current theories of regulation of the complex.
