Environmental (b2) and genetic heritability (h2) of serum isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) were estimated in 96 pairs of healthy twins according to a path analysis model. The results showed significant heritability (0.42) and a very low environmental component (based on obesity and level of habitual physical activity), suggesting that these factors do not influence ICDH serum activity.
