Astrocytes maintained in a chemically defined media undergo differentiation and a parallel increase in pyruvate kinase specific activity. These changes are accompanied by a shift in the isoelectrofocusing pattern, but not by expression of pyruvate kinase M4, the characteristic adult rat brain isozyme. Thus, this chemically defined media lacks a substance required to induce pyruvate kinase M synthesis and this function can be uncoupled from other aspects of cellular differentiation. The uncoupling of pyruvate kinase maturation from cellular differentiation and the observation of only a single, 2.3 kilobase, pyruvate kinase mRNA molecule at different stages of the postnatal development of rat brain support the concept that the K- to M-isoform transformation is a post-transcriptional event. The effect of the individual components of this chemically defined medium on pyruvate kinase specific activity was studied by eliminating one component at a time. The increase in activity was found to be completely dependent upon fibroblastic growth factor and prostaglandin F2 alpha and was partially dependent on the simultaneous presence of insulin.
