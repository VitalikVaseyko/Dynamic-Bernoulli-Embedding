The effects were studied of hydrocortisone and 1-triiodothyronine on the activity of the key enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the glucose phosphate pathway in the liver, during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis induced in male Wistar rats and C3HA mice by N-nitrosodiethylamine. It was found that the effects of hydrocortisone and of thyroid hormone depend on the time of administration of the carcinogen and on the stage of the carcinogenic process in the liver. The effect of hormones on the enzymes studied decreased with the development of tumours in the liver.
