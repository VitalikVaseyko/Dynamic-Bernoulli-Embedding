Targeted proteomics approaches are of value for deep and accurate quantification of protein abundance. Extending such methods to quantify large numbers of proteins requires the construction of predefined targeted assays. We developed a targeted proteomics platform-in vitro proteome-assisted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for protein absolute quantification (iMPAQT)-by using >18,000 human recombinant proteins, thus enabling protein absolute quantification on a genome-wide scale. Our platform comprises experimentally confirmed MRM assays of mass tag (mTRAQ)-labeled peptides to allow for rapid and straightforward measurement of the absolute abundance of predefined sets of proteins by mass spectrometry. We applied iMPAQT to delineate the quantitative metabolic landscape of normal and transformed human fibroblasts. Oncogenic transformation gave rise to relatively small but global changes in metabolic pathways resulting in aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and increased rates of macromolecule synthesis. iMPAQT should facilitate quantitative biology studies based on protein abundance measurements.
