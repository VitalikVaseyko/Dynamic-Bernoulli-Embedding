The activity of several enzymes of regulatory importance for the pathways of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis was investigated in the placenta and liver of pregnant rats and in the liver of non-pregnant female rats. The rats received daily hormonal treatments on Days 15 to 17 of pregnancy and enzyme activities were measured on Day 18. Chorionic gonadotropin induced minor changes in enzyme activity, apart from a decrease in the activity of hepatic enzymes of lipogenesis in non-pregnant rats. Triamcinolone induced a marked increase in enzymes of gluconeogenesis and a decrease in the activity of pyruvate kinase in the liver of pregnant and non-pregnant rats; in contrast, inverse changes in activity, these enzymes were observed in the placenta. This response in the placenta was considered to arise not from direct hormone effect, but from the accompanying hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Triamcinolone also increased the activity of hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase in pregnant and non-pregnant rats, whereas it reduced the activity of this enzyme in the placenta. Estrogen produced changes similar to those of triamcinolone in the liver and placenta, except that it depressed the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in both tissues. Progesterone had little effect on placental and hepatic enzymes. In general, the changes induced by these hormones in the placenta affected fewer enzymes than in the liver, were less extensive in magnitude and not necessarily in the same direction as in the liver. This indicates that the regulatory placental enzymes are subject to specific control mechanisms not necessarily influenced by direct hormone action.
