Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies, we have investigated the impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on the expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis. Meal-training rats to a high glucose diet containing 10% triolein led to a significant induction of hepatic mRNAs encoding glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), malic enzyme (ME), and the S14 protein (S14), but had no effect on thyroid hormone receptor-beta 1 (TR beta 1) and c/EBP alpha gene expression. Replacing triolein with menhaden oil attenuated (by 50-90%) the induction of mRNA encoding GK, ME, PK, FAS, and S14. This effect was rapid (within hours) and for FAS and S14, directed at the transcriptional level. The mRNAs encoding TR beta 1, c/EBP alpha and beta-actin were unaffected by menhaden oil. Studies with cultured primary hepatocytes showed that C18:3,omega 3 (n-3), C18:3,omega 6 (n-6), C20:4, omega 6 (n-6), and C20:5,omega 3 (n-3) were all equally effective at suppressing the level of mRNAs encoding FAS, S14, and PK. This effect was specific for glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes, as expression of beta-actin was not affected by these fatty acids. Moreover, the fatty acids had only marginal effects on cell viability as judged by lactate dehydrogenase release. These data indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids coordinately regulate the expression of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The mechanism of control does not require extrahepatic factors or fatty acid metabolism.
