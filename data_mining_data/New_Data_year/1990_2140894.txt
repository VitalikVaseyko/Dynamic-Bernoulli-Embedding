A method was developed for preparation of dansylated derivatives of adenine nucleotides characterized by fluorescence when being irradiated with UV-light. The involvement of dansylated ATP, ADP and AMP as substrate analogues in energy metabolism is demonstrated in the ATPase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and adenylate kinase reactions. The kinetics of the reactions is discussed.
