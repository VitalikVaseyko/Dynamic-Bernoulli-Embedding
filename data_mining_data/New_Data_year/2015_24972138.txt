Cancer metabolism reprogramming or alterations in epigenetics are linked to an incidence of cancer. It is apparent that epigenetic changes have been found in tumors, therefore, the complete epigenome and entire pathways relevant to cell metabolism are subject to epigenetic dysregulation. Here, we review the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform, a glycolytic enzyme involved in ATP generation and pyruvate production, which plays an essential role in tumor metabolism and growth, and also functions as a protein kinase that phosphorylates histones during genes transcription and chromatin remodeling. We also discuss the potential role of PKM2 in the dynamic integration between metabolic reprogramming and alterations in epigenetics during carcinogenesis and cancer progression.
