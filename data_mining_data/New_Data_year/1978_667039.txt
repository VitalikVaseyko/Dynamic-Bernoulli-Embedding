Binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate to monophosphoglycerate mutase, of which it is an obligatory cofactor, causes changes in the resonance positions of the 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of both phosphate groups. It has previously been shown that these resonances shift when other glycolytic enzymes, such as phosphoglycerate kinase, are added to form the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate . monophosphoglycerate mutase . phosphoglycerate kinase complex. In view of this association, we have examined the set of glycolytic enzymes from aldolase to pyruvate kinase and found evidence of direct communication between all of these enzymes. A multi-enzyme complex of 1--2 . 10(6) daltons has been separated from broken cell ghosts by Biogel column filtration and evidence has been presented to show that this complex exhibits aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase activity. The glycolytic multi-enzyme complex interacts with the outer face of inside-out vesicles prepared from human red cells and the interaction is suppressed by application of 10(-6) M ouabain to the inner face of these vesicles. These studies show that the conformation of the enzymes comprising the megadalton complex are responsive to the application of ouabain to the outer red cell membrane surface.
