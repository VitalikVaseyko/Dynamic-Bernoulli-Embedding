The mechanism responsible for the insulin resistance described in vivo in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of lactating rats was investigated. The effect of insulin on glucose metabolism was studied on isolated brown adipocytes of non-lactating and lactating rats. Insulin stimulation of total glucose metabolism is 50% less in brown adipocytes from lactating than from non-lactating rats. This reflects a decreased effect of insulin on glucose oxidation and lipogenesis. However, the effect of noradrenaline (8 microM) on glucose metabolism was preserved in brown adipocytes from lactating rats as compared with non-lactating rats. The number of insulin receptors is similar in BAT of lactating and non-lactating rats. The insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity is not altered during lactation, for receptor autophosphorylation as well as tyrosine kinase activity towards the synthetic peptide poly(Glu4-Tyr1). The defect in the action of insulin is thus localized at a post-receptor level. The insulin stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity during euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamps is 2-fold lower in BAT from lactating than from non-lactating rats. However, the percentage of active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase is similar in non-lactating and lactating rats (8.6% versus 8.9% in the basal state, and 37.0% versus 32.3% during the clamp). A decrease in the amount of pyruvate dehydrogenase is likely to be involved in the insulin resistance described in BAT during lactation.
