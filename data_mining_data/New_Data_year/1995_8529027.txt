The ability of glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), aldolase, pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase muscle-type (LDH(M)), to generate interactive microtubule networks was investigated. Bundles have previously been defined as the parallel alignment of several microtubules and are one form of microtubule networks. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy, interactive networks of microtubules as well as bundles were readily observed in the presence of GAPDH, aldolase, or PK. These networks appear morphologically as cross-linked microtubules, oriented in many different ways. Light scattering indicated that the muscle forms of GAPDH, aldolase, PK and LDH(m) caused formation of the microtubule networks. Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) and lactate dehydrogenase heart-type (LDH(H)), glycolytic enzymes which do not interact with tubulin or microtubules, did not produce bundles, or interactive networks. Sedimentation experiments confirmed that the enzymes that cross-link also co-pellet with the microtubules. Such cross-linking of microtubules indicate that the enzymes are multivalent with the capability of simultaneous binding to more than one microtubule.
