Sterile inflammation after tissue damage is a ubiquitous response, yet it has the highest amplitude in the liver. This has major clinical consequences, for alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH and NASH) account for the majority of liver disease in industrialized countries and both lack therapy. Requirements for sustained sterile inflammation include increased oxidative stress and activation of the HIF-1alpha signaling pathway. We demonstrate the ability of digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, to protect from liver inflammation and damage in ASH and NASH. Digoxin was effective in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and suppressing HIF-1alpha pathway activation. A proteomic screen revealed that digoxin binds pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and independently of PKM2 kinase activity results in chromatin remodeling and downregulation of HIF-1alpha transactivation. These data identify PKM2 as a mediator and therapeutic target for regulating liver sterile inflammation, and demonstrate a novel role for digoxin that can effectively protect the liver from ASH and NASH.
