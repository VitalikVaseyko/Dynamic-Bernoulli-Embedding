The isozyme pattern of pyruvate kinase in canine erythrocytes changes following birth. These changes have been followed by electrophoretic, immunologic, and kinetic measurements of the isozymes. At birth, a mixture of isozymes is present consisting of the M2 isozyme and hybrid molecules containing M2 and R subunits. With increasing animal age, the content of M2 subunits decreases and the content of R subunits increases. At 6 months of age, the isozyme pattern is indistinguishable from that of adult erythrocytes which contain only the R tetramer. We conclude that there is a switch in erythrocyte pyruvate kinase gene expression during the first 6 months of postnatural life. The existence of hybrid molecules during the switch indicates that both M2 and R genes are expressed within each erythroid precursor cell. The developmental changes in erythrocyte pyruvate kinase are consistent with the role of this enzyme in the regulation of the oxygen-transport function of canine hemoglobin by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the postnatal period.
