Hepatocytes isolated from rats fed on a chow diet or a low-protein (8%) diet were used to study the effects of various factors on flux through the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex. The activity of this complex was also determined in cell-free extracts of the hepatocytes. Hepatocytes isolated from chow-fed rats had greater flux rates (decarboxylation rates of 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate) than did hepatocytes isolated from rats fed on the low-protein diet. Oxidizable substrates tended to inhibit flux through the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase, but inhibition was greater with hepatocytes isolated from rats fed on the low-protein diet. 2-Chloro-4-methylpentanoate (inhibitor of branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase), dichloroacetate (inhibitor of both pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase kinase) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (inhibitor of glycolysis) were effective stimulators of branched-chain oxo acid decarboxylation with hepatocytes from rats fed on a low-protein diet, but had little effect with hepatocytes from rats fed on chow diet. Activity measurements indicated that the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex was mainly (96%) in the active (dephosphorylated) state in hepatocytes from chow-fed rats, but only partially (50%) in the active state in hepatocytes from rats fed on a low-protein diet. Oxidizable substrates markedly decreased the activity state of the enzyme in hepatocytes from rats fed on a low-protein diet, but had much less effect in hepatocytes from chow-fed rats. 2-Chloro-4-methylpentanoate and dichloroacetate increased the activity state of the enzyme in hepatocytes from rats fed on a low-protein diet, but had no effect on the activity state of the enzyme in hepatocytes from chow-fed rats. The results indicate that protein starvation greatly increases the sensitivity of the hepatic branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex to regulation by covalent modification.
