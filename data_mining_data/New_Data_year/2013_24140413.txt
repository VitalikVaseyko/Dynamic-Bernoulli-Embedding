Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and genetic factors play an important role in its genesis. Although mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes encoded by the nuclear genome are known to play a critical role in breast tumorigenesis, the contribution of the mitochondrial genome to this process is unclear. Like the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome also encodes proteins critical for mitochondrion functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is known to be defective in cancer including breast cancer. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more susceptible to mutations due to limited repair mechanisms compared to nuclear DNA (nDNA). Thus changes in mitochondrial genes could also contribute to the development of breast cancer. In this review we discuss mtDNA mutations that affect OXPHOS. Continuous acquisition of mtDNA mutations and selection of advantageous mutations ultimately leads to generation of cells that propagate uncontrollably to form tumors. Since irreversible damage to OXPHOS leads to a shift in energy metabolism towards enhanced aerobic glycolysis in most cancers, mutations in mtDNA represent an early event during breast tumorigenesis, and thus may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. Because mtDNA mutations lead to defective OXPHOS, development of agents that target OXPHOS will provide specificity for preventative and therapeutic agents against breast cancer with minimal toxicity.
