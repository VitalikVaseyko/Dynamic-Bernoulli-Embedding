Plasma glucose levels are maintained by a precise balance between glucose production and its use. Liver pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), 2 key enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively, play a crucial role in this glucose homeostasis along with skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT4). In the diabetic state, this balance is disturbed owing to the absence of insulin, the principal factor controlling this regulation. In the present study, alloxan-diabetic animals having high glucose levels of more than 300 mmol/L have been taken and the administration of Trigonella seed powder (TSP) to the diabetic animals was assessed for its effect on the expression of PK and PEPCK in liver and GLUT4 distribution in skeletal muscle of alloxan-diabetic rats. TSP treatment to the diabetic animals resulted in a marked decrease in the plasma glucose levels. Trigonella treatment partially restored the altered expression of PK and PEPCK. TSP treatment also corrected the alterations in the distribution of GLUT4 in the skeletal muscle.
