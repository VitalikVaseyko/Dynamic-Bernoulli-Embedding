The activity of granulocyte pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phospho dehydrogenase in 12 patients with severe atopic dermatitis in active stage of disease and in remission was investigated. It was found that in active stage the activity of both enzymes was not significantly different than in healthy individuals. In remission pyruvate kinase activity was significantly decreased and glucose-6-phospho dehydrogenase activity was found to be non significantly decreased.
