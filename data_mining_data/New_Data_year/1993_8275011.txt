Effects of prolactin(Prl), bromocriptine(Br), testosterone propionate (TP), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and combinations of these androgens with Prl/Br on the maximum catalytic capacities of seminal vesicular enzymes involved in the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways in castrated mature monkeys were studied. Castration decreased the activities of all of the enzymes studied such as hexokinase(HK), 6-phosphofructokinase(PFK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(G3PD), pyruvate kinase(PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase(6PGD) in the seminal vesicles. Prl restored the activities of all of the enzymes to their normal values except G3PD. TP/DHT maintained all the enzyme activities at the normal tissue intact level. Prl given along with androgens further enhanced the androgen action with regard to all the enzymes activities except G3PD. Br decreased all of the enzymes but Br with androgens maintained all the enzyme activities at the normal level. Castration decreased significantly serum T/DHT titres but Prl did not alter Prl levels. Prl+TP/DHT elevated Prl levels. Br alone decreased serum Prl, T and DHT titres, but Br+TP/DHT decreased only Prl, elevated T and maintained DHT levels. These results suggest that Prl has a direct as well as a synergistic action with androgens on the activities of the enzymes of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways in the seminal vesicles of castrated monkeys.
