Weaning rats were divided into two groups, one group being fed a vitamin E-deficient diet, and the other an alpha-tocopherol-containing (50 mg/kg) control diet. Rats were killed at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months of feeding. The following results were obtained. 1. Both plasma and liver alpha-tocopherol levels decreased greatly by feeding vitamin E-deficient diet for 1 month, and thereafter decreased gradually by continued feeding. 2. Somehow different results were obtained concerning liver peroxidation value by the method of analysis. In the case of chemiluminescence, the value increased by vitamin E deficiency during the first 2 months, but thereafter, the value was almost unchanged. On the contrary, in the case of TBA-RS, the value increased gradually throughout the entire 4 months of feeding period. 3. Both plasma alpha-CPI level and pyruvate kinase activity increased by vitamin E deficiency, showing similar pattern of change with feeding period. Especially, marked increase of these values was observed in vitamin E-deficient rats fed for longer than 2 months, and differences from control groups were highly significant (in both cases, at 2 months, p < 0.005, and at 3 and 4 months, p < 0.001). And, in vitamin E-deficient group, including all the rats fed on test diet for 1 to 4 months, correlation between both values was very high, and was highly significant (r = 0.9060, p < 0.001).
