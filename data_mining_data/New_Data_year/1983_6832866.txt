The effect of two sesquiterpene lactones of the germacranolide group, eupatoriopicrin and hydroxyisonobilin, on the glycolytic metabolism of human lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin was tested. Glucose and lactic acid levels as well as the activities of phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were measured. Both lactones caused a decrease in glucose consumption and lactic acid formation as well as the inhibition of the tested enzymes. A stronger inhibitory effect was observed in the case of hydroxyisonobilin, particularly with regard to phosphofructokinase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
