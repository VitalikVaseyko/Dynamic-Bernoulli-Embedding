Carp (Cyprinus carpio) liver maintained normal glycogen content and enzyme complement for several days in organ culture. Epinephrine-stimulated glycogenolysis, phosphorylase activation, and cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50s of 100, 100, and 500 nM, respectively. These actions were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine. Glycogenolysis and tissue cAMP were uninfluenced by 10(-6) M arginine vasotocin, arginine vasopressin, lysine vasotocin, lysine vasopressin, mesotocin, or oxytocin, but were slightly increased by 10(-5) M isotocin and slightly decreased by 10(-6) M angiotensin II. [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICP), a beta-adrenergic ligand, bound to isolated carp liver membranes with a KD of 83 pM. Maximum binding of 45 fmol/mg protein was at 600 pM. Propranolol, isoprenaline, epinephrine, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and phenoxybenzamine displaced ICP with KDs of 100 nM, 2, 20, 20, 60, and 200 microM, respectively. The alpha-adrenergic antagonists, yohimbine and prazosin, showed no specific binding. These data provide evidence that catecholamines act via beta-adrenergic receptors in carp liver and that alpha-adrenergic receptors are not present. Vasoactive peptides play no significant role in regulation of carp liver glycogenolysis.
