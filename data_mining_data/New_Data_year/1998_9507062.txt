The parasite Entamoeba histolytica is an organism whose main energetic source comes from glycolysis. It has the singularity that several of its glycolytic enzymes use pyrophosphate as an alternative phosphate donor. Thus, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), an inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent enzyme, substitutes pyruvate kinase present in humans. We previously cloned and sequenced the gene that codifies for PPDK in E. histolytica. We now report its expression in a bacterial system and its purification to 98% homogeneity. We determined its K(m) for phosphoenolpyruvate, AMP and PPi (21, < 5 and 100 microM, respectively). Unlike PPDK from maize and bacteria and pyruvate kinase from other cells, EhPPDk is dependent on divalent cations but does not require monovalent cations for activity. The enzyme has an optimum pH of 6.0, it is labile to low temperatures and has a tetrameric structure. Since EhPPDK is a PPi-dependent enzyme, we also tested the effect of some pyrophosphate analogs as inhibitors of activity. Studies on the function and structure of this enzyme may be important for therapeutic research in several parasitic diseases, since it has no counterpart in humans.
