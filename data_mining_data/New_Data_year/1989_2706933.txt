1. Red cell pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) in high and low potassium (K) dogs were shown to exist as multiple forms which were separable by electrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography. The R2-type pyruvate kinase, which was determined to be a young type enzyme in canine red cells, was shown to be the predominant form of pyruvate kinase in high K cells. 2. The M2-type pyruvate kinase, a prototype isozyme in erythroid cells, existed in high K dog erythrocytes as well as in high K and low K dog reticulocytes. 3. Isozyme analysis of high K red cell hexokinase also showed a profile similar to that obtained for low K reticulocytes. 4. These results seem to reflect the immaturity of high K erythrocytes, which suggest that an abnormal cell differentiation or maturation may occur at an early stage of erythroid cell proliferation in high K dogs.
