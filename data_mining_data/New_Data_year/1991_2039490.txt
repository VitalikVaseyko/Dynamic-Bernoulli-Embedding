The relation of expression of the LF-B1 gene with the L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) mRNA level in rat liver and hepatoma cells was investigated. The L-PK mRNA level in rat liver changed after partial hepatectomy, during development and on intake of a high carbohydrate diet, while the level of LF-B1 mRNA remained unchanged or altered reciprocally. Dedifferentiated AH-130 cells, which did not express L-PK mRNA, expressed LF-B1 mRNA. These results suggest that transcription of the pyruvate kinase L gene is not simply regulated by the level of LF-B1 mRNA.
