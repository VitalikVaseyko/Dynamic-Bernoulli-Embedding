Basilar vascular smooth muscle cells (BASMCs) hyperplasia is a prominent feature of cerebrovascular remodeling and stroke during the development of hypertension. Tanshinone IIA (Tan) has been reported to exhibit a protective effect against the pathological features of hypertension. Previous studies have shown that phosphoinostitide-3 kinase (PI3K)/3'-phosphoinostitide dependent kinase (PDK1)/AKT pathway is involved in the regulation of proliferation of various cell types. Therefore, there may be a crosstalk between Tan antihypertension processes and PI3K/PDK1/AKT proliferative effect in BASMCs. To test this hypothesis, we used a 2-kidney, 2-clip hypertension model to examine the effect of Tan on PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway by cellular, molecular, and biochemical approaches. Our results revealed that the abundance of PDK1 in plasma was paralleled with an increase in blood pressure and the cross-sectional area of basilar artery in hypertensive rats. Tan decreased blood pressure and hypertension-induced PDK1 phosphorylation but produced no effect on the phosphorylation of PI3K. Moreover, Tan attenuated endothelin 1 induced the activation of PDK1/AKT pathway in rat BASMCs. Tan could inhibit cell cycle transition by regulating the expression of cyclin D1 and p27, in turn, prevent proliferation of BASMCs. Our study provides a novel mechanism by which Tan prevents cerebrovascular cell proliferation during hypertension, and thus Tan may be a potential therapeutic agent for cerebrovascular remodeling and stroke.
