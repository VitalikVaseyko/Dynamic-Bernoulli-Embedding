Streptozotocin-induced maternal diabetes has been shown to alter developmental patterns of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzyme activities, glycogen deposition and surfactant levels in late fetal rat lung in a tissue-specific manner, as follows: (a) marked reduction in glycogen synthase a activity, due to aberrant interconversion between active and inactive forms of the enzyme; less glycogen was thus accumulated; (b) lowered activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase at term; (c) reduced disaturated phosphatidylcholine (surfactant) concentrations. The diminished synthesis and accumulation of glycogen and glycolytic capacity in the lungs of fetuses of diabetic mothers has been related to reduction in surfactant level, which underlies respiratory distress syndrome frequently encountered in neonates of diabetic pregnancies.
