Phosphoenolthiopyruvate, the analogue of phosphoenolpyruvate in which the bridging oxygen of the phosphate ester is replaced by sulfur, has been synthesized from methyl acrylate and dimethyl (chlorothio)phosphonate. The compound is a substrate for alkaline phosphatase, pyruvate kinase, enolase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Both pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase convert the compound to thiopyruvate, which is a substrate for lactate dehydrogenase. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is slowly inactivated by phosphoenolthiopyruvate.
