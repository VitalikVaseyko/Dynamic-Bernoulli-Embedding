A method based on isothermal calorimetry is described for the direct kinetic assay of pyruvate kinase. In agreement with earlier findings based on the standard coupled assay system for this enzyme in the presence of a fixed ADP concentration, the essentially rectangular hyperbolic dependence of initial velocity upon phosphoenolpyruvate concentration is rendered sigmoidal by the allosteric inhibitor phenylalanine. This effect of phenylalanine can be countered by including a high concentration of a space-filling osmolyte such as proline in the reaction mixtures. This investigation thus affords a dramatic example that illustrates the need to consider potential consequences of thermodynamic nonideality on the kinetics of enzyme reactions in crowded molecular environments such as the cell cytoplasm.
