We have investigated the topography of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol implicated in insulin action by a combination of two complementary methods: (a) chemical labelling with a non-permeable (isethionyl acetimidate) and a permeable (ethyl acetimidate) probe; and (b) enzymatic modifications with beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3). Using the first approach the majority of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol is found in the outer surface of intact hepatocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts and lymphocytes, but not in erythrocytes which presented only a 20% of the total labelled glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol to the exterior. Upon insulin addition (10 nM), about 60% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol was hydrolysed in both hepatocytes and adipocytes but not in erythrocytes. In agreement with the extracellular localization in hepatocytes and with the proposed role of this glycolipid in insulin action, treatment of rat hepatocytes with beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli, an enzyme that hydrolyses the oligosaccharide moiety of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, cleaved 65% of the total glycophospholipid and blocked the effect of insulin (but not of glucagon) on pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). Similar treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus hydrolysed 62% of the total glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. From the various approaches used it is concluded that the majority of this glycophospholipid is at the outer surface in a variety of insulin-sensitive cells.
