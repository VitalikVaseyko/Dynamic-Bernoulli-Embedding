The metabolism of a 13C-labelled substrate, [3-13C]citrate, was monitored in rabbit renal proximal-tubule cells by 13C n.m.r. The relative enrichments of label in glutamate, glutamine and alpha beta-glucose allowed a calculation of the rate of the glutamate dehydrogenase flux relative to the flux via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. A ratio of 1.2 +/- 0.05 was found. Under steady-state conditions of active gluconeogenesis, the ratio of flux through pyruvate kinase to the gluconeogenic rate was 0.97 +/- 0.03.
