Theileria is an obligatory intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite that causes economic losses to the cattle, sheep and goats industry. However, very little information is available on the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of the ovine parasites, Theileria luwenshuni and Theileria uilenbergi. Differences in protein expression between these species were investigated to better understand their biology. Parasites were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides labeled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification, followed by LC-MS/MS. More than 670 proteins, classified into categories primarily related to cellular process (29.78%), metabolic process (28.80%), localization (5.22%) and biological regulation (5.00%), were identified. Seventy-one proteins were differentially expressed; T. luwenshuni had 39 proteins more highly expressed than in T. uilenbergi, whereas T. uilenbergi had 32 that were more highly expressed. Several proteins related to parasite virulence and invasion (cysteine proteinase, histone deacetylase, pyruvate kinase, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) were differentially expressed. Real-time quantitative PCR validated protein expression changes at the transcript level. This is the first report on protein expression for the two most economically important Theileria species in China, and our findings may provide novel opportunities for ovine and caprine theileriosis control.
