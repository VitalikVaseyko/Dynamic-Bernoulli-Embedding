After administration of carcinogens to laboratory animals reduced induction of some enzymes has been found which is believed to be associated with the carcinogenic process. It is suggested that this effect may be used for the testing of chemical substances for carcinogenicity. For this purpose the dietary induction of pyruvate kinase in rat liver was investigated after feeding 2-acetylaminofluorene. The induced activity in the animals fed the carcinogen was found to be significantly lower than in the control, however, the extent of this reduction was too low to be used for testing chemical substances for carcinogenicity.
