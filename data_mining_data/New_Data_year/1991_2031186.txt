Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of omega-functionalized long-chain alkanethiolates on gold films are excellent model systems with which to study the interactions of proteins with organic surfaces. Monolayers containing mixtures of hydrophobic (methyl-terminated) and hydrophilic [hydroxyl-, maltose-, and hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated] alkanethiols can be tailored to select specific degrees of adsorption: the amount of protein adsorbed varies monotonically with the composition of the monolayer. The hexa(ethylene glycol)-terminated SAMs are the most effective in resisting protein adsorption. The ability to create interfaces with similar structures and well-defined compositions should make it possible to test hypotheses concerning protein adsorption.
