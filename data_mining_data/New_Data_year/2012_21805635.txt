Meat quality development is highly influenced by the pH decline caused by the postmortem (PM) glycolysis. Protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism in regulating the activity of glycometabolic enzymes. Here, a gel-based phosphoproteomic study was performed to analyze the protein phosphorylation in sarcoplasmic proteins from three groups of pigs with different pH decline rates from PM 1 to 24 h. Globally, the fast pH decline group had the highest phosphorylation level at PM 1 h, but lowest at 24 h, whereas the slow pH decline group showed the reverse case. The same pattern was also observed in most individual bands in 1-DE. The protein phosphorylation levels of 12 bands were significantly affected by the synergy effects of pH and time (p<0.05). Protein identification revealed that most of the phosphoproteins were glycometabolism-related enzymes, and the others were involved in stress response, phosphocreatine metabolism, and other functions. The phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase and triosephosphate isomerase-1 showed to be related to PM muscle pH decline rate. Our work sheds light on the potential role of protein phosphorylation on regulating meat quality development.
