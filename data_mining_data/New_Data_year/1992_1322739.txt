The effect of total body irradiation (5 Gy) on functional mouse erythroid lineage has been studied. The transferrin binding capacity by bone marrow cells and the activity of glycolytic regulatory enzymes and intracellular levels of 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate in peripheral blood erythrocytes have been determined. Results obtained along one year post-irradiation period suggest a complete recovery in the erythroid cell lineage with respect to the biological endpoints investigated.
