We have previously shown that the transcription of the human sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene was negatively regulated by glucose. Using two clonal metabolic variants of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 we demonstrate here that: 1) although similar growth-related variations of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), frutose 1,6-diphosphatase (F1, 6-dPase), pyruvate kinase (PK) and SI mRNA levels are observed, only F1,6-dPase, PK and SI mRNA levels vary in the same way in response to modifications of glucose utilization; and 2) regulatory elements responsible for the glucose-dependent transcription of the SI gene are located within the -370/+30 region of the promoter.
