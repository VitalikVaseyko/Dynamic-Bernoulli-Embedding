1. Pyruvate kinase from the rumen ciliates genus Entodinium was partially purified and the enzymatic properties were investigated. 2. Three types of pyruvate kinase (type I, II and III) on DEAE-cellulose column were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl. The enzymatic properties differed among the types of enzyme, especially type I and type III displayed different kinetic properties to each other. The enzymatic property of type II enzyme was an intermediate between type I and III. 3. The principal enzyme, type I, required a divalent cation, Mg2+ and was activated with AMP and FDP. ATP was a potent inhibitor. The saturation curves for the substrates, PEP and ADP, were hyperbolic and Km values were 0.15 and 0.27 mM, respectively.
