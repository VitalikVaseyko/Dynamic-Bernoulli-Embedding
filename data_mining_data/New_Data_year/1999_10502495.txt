Activities of enzymes related to glucose metabolism were measured in canine and feline liver. There were no significant differences in plasma glucose and immunoreactive insulin concentrations between dogs and cats. Glucokinase activities were absent in feline liver, however, activities of other glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were significantly higher than those in canine livers. Activities of rate limiting enzymes of gluconeogenesis such as pyruvate carboxylase, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase in feline livers were significantly higher than those in canine livers.
