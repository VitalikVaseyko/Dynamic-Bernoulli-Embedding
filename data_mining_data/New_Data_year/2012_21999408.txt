Least-squares fitting of the Hill equation to quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assays results in frequent unsatisfactory fits. We learn and exploit prior knowledge to improve the Hill fitting in a nonlinear regression method called domain knowledge fitter (DK-fitter). This paper formulates and solves DK-fitter for 44 public qHTS data sets. This new Hill parameter estimation technique is validated using three unbiased approaches, including a novel method that involves generating simulated samples. This paper fosters the extraction of higher quality information from screens for improved potency evaluation.
