Triethylcholine (triethyl-2-hydroxyethyl ammonium) has been compared, in its actions on neuromuscular transmission, with the motor end-plate blocking drugs tubocurarine and decamethonium, with the anticholinesterase neostigmine, and with the closely related drug tetraethylammonium. The experiments were carried out on conscious rabbits and mice, on the tibialis anterior muscle of cats under chloralose anaesthesia and on the isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation of the rat. Anticholinesterase activity was determined manometrically using the Warburg apparatus. Triethylcholine possessed a slight curare-like action, but this effect was shown to be too weak and transient to contribute to the slowly developing and long-lasting transmission failure which occurs selectively in frequently excited nervemuscle preparations and in exercised conscious animals. It was confirmed that the site of the blocking action of triethylcholine was pre-junctional. Triethylcholine often produced a slight potentiation of the contractions before blocking them. This effect was not due to a depolarizing or an anticholinesterase action, and it was concluded that the slight initial facilitating action of triethylcholine on neuromuscular transmission was due to an increase in the quantity of acetylcholine released by the nerve impulse. Tetraethylammonium was much more powerful than triethylcholine in this respect. The pre-junctional transmission failure produced by triethylcholine could not be explained simply on the basis that an initial excessive release led to exhaustion of transmitter.
