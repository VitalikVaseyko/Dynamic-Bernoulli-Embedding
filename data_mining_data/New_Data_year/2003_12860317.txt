The present study reports the antioxidant activity of Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), family Elaegnaceae, on chromium induced oxidative stress in male albino rats. Oxidative stress was induced in the rats by force-feeding of potassium dichromate equivalent to a dose of 30mg/kg body weight (BW) of chromium(VI) for 30 days. Administration of chromium decreased the body weight and increased organ to body weight ratio significantly. Chromium treatment significantly decreased reduced glutathione (GSH), and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels; further it also enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transferase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transferase (GPT) levels in the serum. Different doses of the alcoholic leaf extract of Seabuckthorn were evaluated for the protection against the chromium induced oxidative stress. The results show that the leaf extract at a concentration of 100 and 250mg/kg BW protected the animals from the chromium induced oxidative injury significantly.
