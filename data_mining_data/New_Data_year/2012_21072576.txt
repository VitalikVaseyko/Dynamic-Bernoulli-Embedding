In the present study we investigated the effect of ovariectomy on some parameters of energy metabolism, namely Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and pyruvate kinase activities, as well as the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes activities succinate dehydrogenase, complex II and cytochrome c oxidase in rat striatum. The influence of soy diet rich in isoflavones on the effects elicited by ovariectomy on enzyme activities was also evaluated. Female adult Wistar rats were assigned to one of the following groups: sham (submitted to surgery without removal of the ovaries) and ovariectomized. Seven days after surgery animals were fed for 30 days on a special diet with soy protein or a standard diet with casein (control). Rats were sacrificed after treatment and the striatum was dissected. Results showed that rats subjected to ovariectomy presented a significant increase in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, succinate dehydrogenase and complex II activities. Treatment with isoflavones-rich soy diet was able to reverse the increase of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, but was not effective in reversing the changes caused by ovariectomy on succinate dehydrogenase and complex II activities. Since ovariectomy mimics postmenopausal changes, our findings suggest that dysfunction of brain energy metabolism may be related to neurological symptoms observed in some postmenopausal women.
