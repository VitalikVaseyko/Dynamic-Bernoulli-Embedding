Schizophrenia (SCZ) is the result of DNA alterations and environmental factors, which together lead to differential protein expression and ultimately to the development of the illness. The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, and the molecular background of SCZ is not completely understood. The thalamus, whose dysfunction has been associated with SCZ based in diverse lines of evidences, plays for instance a pivotal role in the central nervous system as a relay center by re-distributing auditory and visual stimuli from diverse brain regions to the cerebral cortex. We analyzed the proteome of postmortem mediodorsal thalamus (MDT) samples from 11 SCZ patients and 8 non-SCZ individuals by using quantitative shotgun-mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Our analyses identified 551 proteins, 50 of which showed significant differential expression. The main pathways affected by the differentially expressed proteins include energy metabolism, oligodendrocyte metabolism, and cytoskeleton assembly. The potential protein biomarkers candidates myelin basic protein and myelin oligodendrocyte protein were validated by Western blot in the MDT samples and also in cerebrospinal fluid from a separate set of samples of 17 first-episode SCZ patients and 10 healthy controls. The differential expression of mu-crystallin, protein kinase C-gamma, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were confirmed in MDT. Because we found several glycolysis enzymes to be differentially expressed, we measured the levels of pyruvate and NADPH and found them to be altered in MDT. The protein changes described here corroborate the importance of myelin/oligodendrocyte and energy metabolism in SCZ and highlight new potential biomarkers candidates that may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex disease.
