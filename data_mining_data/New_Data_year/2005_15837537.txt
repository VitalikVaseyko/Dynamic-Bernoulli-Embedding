Rats (FLF1) were pretreated with 2 and 20 mg/kg/day fluvastatin (Flu), and after 6 weeks, hepatocellular tumor cells were inoculated under the left renal capsule. At different times, growth and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity of the primary tumors and lymph node metastases were determined. Flu had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on primary and metastatic tumors, and the inhibitory effect on growth and PK activity in metastases were higher than in primary tumors. Finally, Flu had an earlier inhibitory effect on the early appeared PK activity in metastases than in primary tumors.
