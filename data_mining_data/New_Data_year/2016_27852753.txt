Cellular and mitochondrial metabolic capacity of the heart has been suggested to limit performance of fish at warm temperatures. We investigated this hypothesis by studying the effects of acute temperature increases (16, 23, 30, 32.5 and 36 degrees C) on the thermal sensitivity of 10 key enzymes governing cardiac oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in two populations of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) field-acclimated to 15.5 and 22.5 degrees C, as well as the effects of acclimation on cardiac lipid composition. In both populations of perch, the activity of glycolytic (pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase) enzymes increased with acute warming. However, at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, a drastic thermally induced decline in citrate synthase activity was observed in the cold- and warm-acclimated populations, respectively, indicating a bottleneck for producing the reducing equivalents required for oxidative phosphorylation. Yet, the increase in aspartate aminotransferase and malate dehydrogenase activities occurring in both populations at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C suggests that the malate-aspartate shuttle may help to maintain cardiac oxidative capacities at high temperatures. Warm acclimation resulted in a reorganization of the lipid profile, a general depression of enzymatic activity and an increased fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity. Although these compensatory mechanisms may help to maintain cardiac energy production at high temperatures, the activity of the electron transport system enzymes, such as complexes I and IV, declined at 36 degrees C in both populations, indicating a thermal limit of oxidative phosphorylation capacity in the heart of European perch.
