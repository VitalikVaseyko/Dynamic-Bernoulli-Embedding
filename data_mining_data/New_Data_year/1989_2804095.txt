Fatigue of isolated gastrocnemius muscles from R. pipiens leads to a marked increase in the proportion of phosphofructokinase bound to the particulate fraction and a decrease in the binding of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine phosphokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Only the proportion of aldolase bound to the particulate fraction was unaffected by fatigue. This pattern was unchanged when fatigued muscles were extracted at pH 6.5 rather than 7.5. Thus, muscle fatigue leads to opposite changes in the binding of the glycolytic enzymes.
