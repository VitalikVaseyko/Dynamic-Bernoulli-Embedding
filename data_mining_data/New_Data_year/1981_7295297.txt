An electrophoretically detectable variant of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) has been found in the house mouse Mus musculus. The variant was seen in all tissues examined except liver and red cells. The gene (Pk-3) determining this electrophoretic variation is inherited as an autosomal codominant located on chromosome 9. Our data confirm that the genetic determination of pyruvate kinase in liver and red cells is separate from that in other tissues. In addition, our results indicate that the muscle (M1) and kidney (M2) pyruvate kinase isozymes share at least one genetic determinant and may in fact be determined by the same structural gene.
