Endurance exercise has been shown to reduce pancreatic islets glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Anaplerotic/cataplerotic pathways are directly related to GSIS signaling. However, the effect of endurance training upon pancreatic islets anaplerotic enzymes is still unknown. In this sense, we tested the hypothesis that endurance exercise decreases GSIS by reducing anaplerotic/cataplerotic enzymes content. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups as follows: control sedentary group (CTL), trained 1 day per week (TRE1x), trained 3 days per week (TRE3x) and trained 5 days per week (TRE5x) and submitted to an 8 weeks endurance-training protocol. After the training protocol, pancreatic islets were isolated and incubated with basal (2.8 mM) and stimulating (16.7 mM) glucose concentrations for GSIS measurement by radioimmunoassay. In addition, pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) content were quantified by western blotting. Our data showed that 8 weeks of chronic endurance exercise reduced GSIS by 50% in a dose-response manner according to weekly exercise frequency. PYC showed significant twofold increase in TRE3x. PYC enhancement was even higher in TRE5x (p < 0.0001). PDH and PDK4 reached significant 25 and 50% enhancement, respectively compared with CTL. ACL and GDH also reported significant 50 and 75% increase, respectively. The absence of exercise-induced correlations among GSIS and anaplerotic/cataplerotic enzymes suggests that exercise may control insulin release by activating other signaling pathways. The observed anaplerotic and cataplerotic enzymes enhancement might be related to beta-cell surviving rather than insulin secretion.
