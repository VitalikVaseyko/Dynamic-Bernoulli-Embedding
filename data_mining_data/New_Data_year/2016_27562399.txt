Glioblastoma multiforme is a common primary brain tumor, which exhibits an imbalance between glioma cell growth and glucose metabolism. Recent discoveries have found that the multiple pathways and downstream genes involved in the dysregulated metabolic pathway allow tumor to manifest and progress, which is critical to patients with glioblastoma associated with significant systemic and immunosuppression. Moreover, immune microenvironment is considered a major obstacle to generating an effective antitumor immune response. Therefore, identification of patient-specific tumor antigens through highly personalized approach, and effective combination with other therapeutic modalities such as molecular agents targeting tumor metabolic oncogene addiction and potent host immune modulators, may provide targets for more effective therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma. In this review, we aim to highlight the most recent findings regarding glucose uptake and proliferation, cell mobility and to expand our investigations and more comprehensively examine different aspects of glucose metabolism in glioblastoma, such as pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its enzymes, metabolic modulation of genetics and epigenetics and key metabolic regulators, importantly, tumor cell-induced glucose deprivation inhibits T-cell glycolysis and immunogenic functions. Furthermore, this review will concentrate on how to discover effective drug targets to regulate glucose metabolism in tumor and T cell growth for future glioblastoma therapies, and the challenges faced by the field of metabolism in tumor immune microenviroment.
