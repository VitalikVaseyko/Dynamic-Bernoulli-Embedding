The activity of glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase), content of metabolites (lactate, pyruvate, ATP, 2,3-DPG) and haemolytic stability of rat erythrocytes at the action of chronic X-irradiation at a daily dose 0.258 mC/kg, 2.58 mC/kg, 5.16 mC/kg during 90, 60 and 30 days, accordingly, have been investigated. It was shown, that the glycolytic enzymes activity of female rats in different seasons may vary in wide limits. A general tendency to the decrease of lactate dehydrogenase activity is revealed, but the beginning effects under the irradiation at a daily dose of 2.58 mC/kg and 5.16 mC/kg may be differently directed. The analogous tendencies are found in the change of hexokinase activity. The changes in pyruvate kinase activity correlated with erythrocytes haemolytic stability. The data obtained prove that changes in the direction of glycolytic enzymes activity under the irradiation depend on the initial level, which is caused by seasonal peculiarities of physiological state.
