Isolated hepatocytes from 24 h starved chicks were depleted of phosphate and incubated in the presence of 32P-orthophosphate. Pyruvate kinase type M2 from crude cell extracts was partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxylapatite. SDS slab gel electrophoresis of the fractions containing the enzyme and immunoprecipitation with antisera showed the phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase type M2. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified serine as phosphate acceptor.
