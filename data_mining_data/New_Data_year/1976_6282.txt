Yeast hexokinase A(ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase) is inactivated when incubated in the presence of xylose and ATPMg, or in the presence of D-lyxose in a reaction medium in which ATPMg is being continuously regenerated (phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase). The inactivation is due to the phorphorylation of the protein. A linear relationship was observed between the inactivation and the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P] ATP. All hexokinase and ATPase activity of the enzyme is lost when one phosphoryl group is incorporated per enzyme subunit (molecular weight 51,000). The phosphoryl group is covalently bound by a ester linkage with a serine residue of the protein.
