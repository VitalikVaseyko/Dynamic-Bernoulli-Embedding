Poly U dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis from 14C phenylalanyl-tRNA, under known optimal conditions, in ribosomes obtained from NaF-treated Rabbit reticulocytes, is only slightly stimulated by the addition of ATP, GTP and UTP in the absence of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. However, in the presence of the energy generating system, the stimulation by ATP far surpasses that by other nucleotides. A scheme of reactions which help explain this observation is presented.
