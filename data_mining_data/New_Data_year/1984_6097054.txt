The present investigation describes the urinary output of four different enzymes localized within nephron cells in two models of experimental acute renal failure. The activities of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were determined in the urine of rats after maleate or HgCl2 intoxication. 2 hours after maleate intoxication the urinary output of FDP, GST and NAG was significantly increased above control values. 6 hours after HgCl2 poisoning FDP, GST and NAG showed increased urinary enzyme activities. The urinary activity of each enzyme was significantly increased 24 hours after intoxication. These results are in good accordance with the damage observed on light and electron microscopic investigations carried out with both experimental models. Furthermore, general problems of urinary enzyme measurements are discussed in this paper.
