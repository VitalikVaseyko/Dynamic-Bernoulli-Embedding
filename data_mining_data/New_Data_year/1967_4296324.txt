1. Changes in the activities of ATP citrate lyase, ;malic' enzyme, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, and in the ability to incorporate [1-(14)C]acetate into lipid have been measured in the livers of developing rats between late foetal life and maturity. 2. In male rats the activities of those systems directly or indirectly concerned in lipogenesis (acetate incorporation into lipid, ATP citrate lyase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) fall after birth and are maintained at a low value until weaning. After weaning these activities rise to a maximum between 30 and 40 days and then decline, reaching adult values at about 60 days. ;Malic' enzyme activity follows a similar course, except that none could be detected in the foetal liver. Pyruvate kinase activity is lower in foetal than in adult livers and rises to slightly higher than the adult value in the post-weaning period. Fructose 1,6-diphosphatase activity rises from a very low foetal value to reach a maximum at about 10 days but falls rapidly after weaning to reach adult values at about 30 days. 3. Weaning rats on to a high-fat diet caused the low activities of acetate incorporation, ATP citrate lyase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, characteristic of the suckling period, to persist. ;Malic' enzyme and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase activities were not altered appreciably. 4. No differences could be detected in hepatic enzyme activities between males and females up to 35 days, but after this time female rats gave higher values for acetate incorporation, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and ;malic' enzyme activity. 5. The results are discussed in relation to changes in alimentation and hormonal influences.
