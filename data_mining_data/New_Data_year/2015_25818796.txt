OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of tripartite-motif protein 25 (TRIM25) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and explore their role in the occurrence and progression of NSCLC. METHODS: The expressions of TRIM25 and PKM2 protein were detected in 60 NSCLC specimens and 20 adjacent normal lung tissue (>5 cm from the lesions) with immunofluorescence histochemical method and in 10 fresh specimens of NSCLC with Western blotting. The results were analyzed in relation with the clinicopathological features of the patients. RESULTS: The positivity rates of TRIM25 expression was 45% in the 60 lung carcinoma specimens, significantly higher than that in the 20 normal lung tissues (10%, P=0.005). TRIM25 protein was expressed in 28.6% of lung adenocarcinoma tissues and in 59.4% of squamous carcinoma tissues (P=0.017). TRIM25 protein expression was positively correlated with the TNM stages and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC (P<0.05). The expressions of PKM2 protein in 60 cases of lung carcinoma was 73.3%,while in 20 cases of normal lung tissues the expressions was 30%(P=0.001). The positivity rates of PKM2 expression differed significantly between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma (57.1% vs 87.5%, P=0.008). An inverse correlation was noted between TRIM25 and PKM2 expressions (P=0.026). CONCLUSION: TRIM25 and PKM2 protein may participate in the occurrence and progression of NSCLC, and their expressions are inversely correlated.
