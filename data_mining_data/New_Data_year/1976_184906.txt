Glucose metabolism in Mycobacterium smegmatis was investigated by the radiorespirometric method and by assaying for key enzymes of the major energy-yielding pathways. Glucose is oxidized in this organism mainly through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, irrespective of the carbon source used for growth. The pentose phosphate pathway plays only a minor role and its extent depends on the carbon source used for growth. Enzymes of glycolytic and oxidative pathways were detected in cells grown on glucose, glycerol, or pyruvate but enzymes of the Entner-Duodroff pathway could be detected only in glucose-grown cells. Labeled acetate is utilized by cells cultured on glucose, glycerol, and pyruvate. In all cases more of C1 of acetate was converted to CO2 while incorporation into cellular constituents was maximum from C2 of acetate.
