Two cDNA codings for glycolytic enzymes were cloned from a cDNA library constructed from the schizont stage of the avian parasite Eimeria tenella. Enolase and pyruvate kinase cDNA were fully sequenced and compared with sequences of enzymes from other organisms. Although these enzymes were already detected in the sporozoite stage, their expression was enhanced during the first schizogony in accordance with the anaerobic conditions of this part of the life cycle of the parasite. Under activating conditions, microscopic observations suggest that these glycolytic enzymes were relocalised inside sporozoites and moreover were in part secreted. The enzymes were also localised at the apex of the first generation of merozoites. Enolase was partly observed inside the nucleus of sporozoites and schizonts. Taken together, these results suggest that glycolytic enzymes not only have a function in glycolysis during anaerobic intracellular stages but may also participate in the invasion process and, for enolase, in the control of gene regulation.
