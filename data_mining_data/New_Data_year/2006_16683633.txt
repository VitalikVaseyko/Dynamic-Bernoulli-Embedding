Important biological activities could be affected in metal exposed species, and amongthe main physiological functions, immunity may provide one (or more) effector(s) which expression can be directly affected by a metal exposure in various macroinvertebrates. As many proteinic effectors showed a high degree of homology between species, we have developed a PCR approach to characterize partial mRNA sequences of selected effectors in the laboratory model, Eisenia fetida. After cloning, levels of expression of each gene were analyzed following exposures (80 and 800 mg/kg) to cadmium spiked soils using real-time PCR. An implemented approach was allowed to test quickly potential biomarkers in Eisenia fetida. Selected effectors were calmodulin, heat shock proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, metallothionein, beta-adrenergic receptor kinase, pyruvate carboxylase, trancriptionally controlled tumor protein, protein kinase C, and ubiquitin. Most of the selected effectors did not show variations of expression level after exposure. Others expressed weak changes of expression as heat shock proteins. At lastfor catalase and metallothionein, early suitable variations of expression were observed.
