Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK, EC 2.7.2.3), which is expressed specifically in sperm and spermatids, is an enzyme in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate. We developed an electrophoresis method to determine relative PGK-2 quantity and applied it to evaluate spermatogenesis activity. In the ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME)-induced testicular toxicity, relative PGK-2 quantity had not decreased until 4 weeks of exposure. Mean relative PGK-2 quantities, defined as PGK-2 quantity over PGK-1 quantity in a pooled spleen sample (+/- SD) were: 1.43 +/- 0.32 for control animals (N = 10); 1.67 +/- 0.24 for the group exposed at 500 mg/kg for 5 days (N = 6); 1.85 +/- 0.58 for the group exposed at 500 mg/kg for 2 weeks (N = 6); 0.09 +/- 0.06 for the group exposed at 500 mg/kg for 4 weeks (N = 6); not detectable in animals exposed at 500 mg/kg for 5 weeks (N = 7); 0.208 +/- 0.103 for the group exposed at 250 mg/kg for 5 weeks (N = 6); and 1.35 +/- 0.38 for the group exposed at 125 mg/kg for 5 weeks (N = 6). These relative quantities showed a good correlation with sperm/spermatid counts (r = 0.823, p less than 0.01) and histological findings. These findings suggest that EGME has toxicity on primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia. In the case of sterility associated with a chromosomal abnormality (chromosomal translocation between chromosome X and 16), relative PGK-2 quantity was not detected in any of the seven adult (12 weeks of age) mice, although many primary spermatocytes were detected by histological examination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
