The electrophoretic mobility and the immunologic specificity of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) of the homozygous Basenji dog with PK deficiency were identical to those of normal M2-type PK isozyme seen in the white cell but not to those of the erythrocyte PK isozyme. Kinetic properties and stability were also consistent with the M2-type PK isozyme. Defective PK in the homozygous red cell was due to the absence of the erythrocyte PK isozyme and the compensatory presence of M2-type PK isozyme, as seen in the severe classical type PK deficiency in man.
