Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a common metabolic disease often complicated by a number of pathological conditions among which are haematological changes and alterations in blood cell function. Human and feline diabetes mellitus patients have been reported to be associated with oxidative stress that can lead to membrane alterations and to reduced erythrocyte life-span. Erythrocyte function in dogs affected by IDDM has been investigated during insulin therapy, paying attention to antioxidant status, membrane resistance, enzyme activities and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) concentration. Thirteen diabetic and 36 healthy dogs were bled and haematology and blood chemistry assays were performed to evaluate the degree of compensation. Osmotic fragility, the activities of the enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate-kinase (PK) and the concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and 2,3DPG were evaluated in the erythrocytes. Diabetic dogs did not differ from controls in terms of haematological parameters, except for higher numbers of platelets. Higher values of fructosamine, glucose, protein, plasma potassium and calculated osmolality were detected in the plasma from diabetic dogs. No differences were detected in osmotic fragility, GSH concentration and PK activity between the two groups but 2,3DPG concentration and G6PD activity were statistically significantly higher in the diabetic group. The results indicate minimal alterations in erythrocyte functions occur in insulin-treated diabetic dogs. This contrasts with what has been reported for IDDM humans and cats.
