In previous papers we reported that the earlier peak time (PT) in radiorespiratory during feeding with 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene(3'-Me-DAB) is due to activation of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway together with hepatic cell proliferation reflecting the toxic effects of this carcinogen. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the results of radiorespiratory and the levels of enzyme activities of HMP pathway in regenerating rat liver in connection with hepatic cell proliferation. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into rat liver DNA and the activities of hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase(G-6-PD) reached a maximum at the 3rd day after partial hepatectomy. On radiorespirometry using [U-14C] glucose, the peak time (PT) was much earlier at the 2nd to 3rd day after partial hepatectomy. The peak height (PH) decreased to less than 1/2 of the initial level at the 2nd, but began to recover from the 3rd day. The yield value (YV) remained below the initial level for 4 days after the operation.
