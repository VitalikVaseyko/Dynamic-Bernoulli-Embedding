Clinical, familial and biochemical studies from six unrelated Spanish patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia and erythrocyte pyruvate-kinase (PK) deficiency are described. A remarkable molecular heterogeneity of mutant PK variants involving kinetic properties, molecular stability or electrophoretic mobility is demonstrated. In two patients whose PK variants showed abnormal electrophoretic pattern and strongly aberrant kinetic properties, a chronic hemolytic anemia associated with several other clinical manifestations of chronic hemolysis occurred. In patients whose PK variants showed less abnormal kinetic and electrophoretic characteristics, there was only moderate or mild hemolytic anemia. One patient's PK variant with no obvious kinetic or electrophoretic alterations, showed a markedly decreased heat stability with severe diminution of antigenic concentration of the enzyme. This patient presented a spectacular clinical and hematological improvement after splenectomy. The purpose of the present study is to describe six new PK variants of Spanish origin. In addition, an attempt is made to find relationships between molecular abnormalities of mutant PK variants and the severity of hemolytic anemia, in these patients. The possible role of some kinetic alteration, such as fructose disphosphate (FDP) activation or ATP inhibition of PK variants, in the clinical manifestations of chronic hemolysis is also suggested.
