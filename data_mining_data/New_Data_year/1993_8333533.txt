The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of changes in dietary protein level on overall availability of amino acids for tissues. For this purpose, rats were adapted to diets containing various concentrations of casein (7.5, 15, 30, and 60%) and were sampled either during the postprandial or postabsorptive period. In rats fed the protein-deficient diet, glucogenic amino acids (except threonine) tended to accumulate in plasma, liver, and muscles. In rats fed high-protein diets, the hepatic balance of glucogenic amino acids was markedly enhanced and their liver concentrations were consistently depressed. This response was the result of a marked induction of amino acid catabolism (a 45-fold increase of liver threonine-serine dehydratase activity was observed with the 60% casein diet). The muscle concentrations of threonine, serine, and glycine underwent changes parallel to plasma and liver concentrations, and a significant reduction of glutamine was observed. During the postabsorptive period, adaptation to high-protein diets resulted in a sustained catabolism of most glucogenic amino acids, which accentuated the drop in their concentrations (especially threonine) in all the compartments studied. The time course of metabolic adaptation from a 60 to a 15% casein diet has also been investigated. Adaptation of alanine and glutamine metabolism was rapid, whereas that of threonine, serine, and glycine was delayed and required 7-11 days. This was paralleled by a relatively slow decay of liver threonine-serine dehydratase (T-SDH) activity in contrast to the rapid adaptation of pyruvate kinase activity after refeeding a high-carbohydrate diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
