Hexokinase (ATP:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.2) and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.40) were co-immobilized within semipermeable collodion microcapsules. The resulting microcapsules displayed excellent hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities, with the measured pyruvate kinase activity considerably greater than that measured for hexokinase. The co-immobilized enzymes, when used sequentially were capable of recycling both ATP and ADP when exposed to the appropriate conditions. Furthermore, when exposed to limiting amounts of coenzyme, the cycles were capable of reusing the total amount of coenzyme supplied at least three times in 90 min. The use of microencapsulation to produce partially "self sufficient" enzyme systems is discussed.
