In isolated hepatocytes, dichloroacetate directly activates pyruvate dehydrogenase whereas its biotransformation product, oxalate, inhibits pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase. Dichloroacetate, which decreases blood lactate very efficiently, has been sucessfully tested in the acute treatment of congenital lactic acidosis, but its transformation into oxalate and potential chronic toxicity prompt to replace it by 2-chloropropionate as a therapeutic agent.
