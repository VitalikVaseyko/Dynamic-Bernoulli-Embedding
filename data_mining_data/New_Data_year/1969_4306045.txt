This paper reports the discovery that the activity of the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from beef kidney mitochondria is regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction sequence. The site of this regulation is the pyruvate dehydrogenase component of the complex. Phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase are catalyzed by an ATP-specific kinase (i.e., a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), and dephosphorylation and concomitant reactivation are catalyzed by a phosphatase (i.e., a pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase). The kinase and the phosphatase appear to be regulatory subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
