The activity of pyruvate kinase, subtype M2 (PKM2), is known to be increased by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), one of the metabolites in the glycolytic pathway. Recently, we have shown that in vitro, Fru-1,6-P2 activated the association of monomer to form the tetrameric PKM2. To ascertain whether this mode of regulation also occurs in vivo, we prepared monomer-specific monoclonal antibody and quantified the monomer formation in situ in cultured cells by immunocytochemistry. The intracellular Fru-1,6-P2 was manipulated by the glucose concentration in the media. At the physiological concentration of glucose (4-6 mM), 30-35% of PK existed as a monomer. However, PKM2 was dissociated into monomer within minutes after cells were deprived of glucose. The maximal level of monomer was detected after 1 h at 37 degrees C. Monomer was rapidly (within minutes) converted to tetramer after addition of glucose. Furthermore, when cells cultured in 10 mM of glucose were treated with cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of the glucose transporter, a maximal level of monomer was detected within 20-30 min. Determination of Fru-1,6-P2 indicated that its intracellular concentration decreased concomitantly with the reduction in glucose concentration in the medium. These results indicate that monomer-tetramer inter-conversion is a major in vivo cellular regulatory mechanism in response to changes in the extracellular glucose concentration via Fru-1,6-P2.
