It is known that in fish tissues, in particular in brain, a part of pyruvate kinase is bound to structural elements. In this work the comparative analysis of properties of free and bound pyruvate kinase from the brain of sea teleost scorpion fish has been done. The sensitivity to change of pH medium and to heating was different in these two forms. The affinity of free enzyme for the both substrates was higher, than of the bound one although this difference was not reliable because of big individual variation. The difference of Hill coefficient in free and bound forms can indicate to different character of interaction between the active sites in oligomers of the both forms.
