An inverse relationship between 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels and the ratio calculated from pyruvate kinase and bisphosphoglycerate mutase activities has been observed in red populations of rats during animal development. Counter-current distribution in aqueous two-phase systems of these cells populations shows a displacement of distribution profiles towards the high-numbered cavities of the rotor as animal ages. Heterogeneity of cells after distribution is only observed during the switching process from fetal to adult red cells taking place along the postnatal stage of development. Values for the pyruvate kinase/bisphosphoglycerate mutase ratio in these fractions suggest the separation of fetal (liver) from adult (bone marrow) red cells.
