Several mutants aspergillus nidulans defective in carbohydrate metabolism were tested for growth on different carbon sources. D-Galacturonate was found to be a substrate, useful to discriminate between mutants in pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or pyruvate carboxylase. The results of these tests indicate how particular classes of mutants can be obtained and which substrates can be used preferentially for a rapid phenotypical screening of unknown mutants.
