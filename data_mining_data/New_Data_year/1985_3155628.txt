The enzymes hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) were studied in rat lung during development starting at day 16 of gestation (day-6) until 5 days after birth. During gestation, the activities of hexokinase type II, enolase and pyruvate kinase decreased and reached adult values at birth or shortly thereafter. Hexokinase type I remained relatively constant and the decrease of soluble type II hexokinase was compensated for by an increment of particle-bound hexokinase starting at day 20 of gestation until birth. In contrast, phosphofructokinase activity increased until day 20 of gestation followed by a rapid fall in activity until 2 days after birth. Except for hexokinase no isoenzyme shifts were observed in the period of observation. The results are discussed with respect to the proposed relationship between glycogen breakdown and surfactant synthesis during the perinatal period and suggest a regulatory role for phosphofructokinase in this process.
