The changes of isocitrate lyase levels with respect to the catabolism of triglycerides have been studied during the germination of Pinus pinea seeds. We studied the effects of octanoate, oleate, and inhibitors of protein synthesis on isocitrate lyase during germination. Pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase were also assayed. Octanoate and oleate inhibited the isocitrate lyase activity, similarly to cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, and actinomycin, inhibitors of protein biosynthesis. This inhibitory effect is not specific but is strikingly evident with isocitrate lyase. This inhibition was not proportional to the concentration but was proportional to the chain length of oleate and octanoate.
