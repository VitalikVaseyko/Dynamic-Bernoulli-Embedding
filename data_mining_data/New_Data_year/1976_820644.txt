Cell-free extracts of Rickettsia typhi were tested for activities of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, of glutamate catabolism, and of glycolysis. The organisms were grown in the yolk sacs of chicken embryos, harvested shortly before the time of embryo death, purified by Renografin density gradient centrifugation, and ruptured in a French pressure cell. The following enzymatic activities were demonstrated: high levels of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), moderate levels of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate, succinate, and isocitrate dehydrogenases, and citrate synthase, and low levels of glutamate-pyruvate transaminase. The specific activities of some of these enzymes were higher when the rickettsiae were harvested at a time of active proliferation, 3 to 4 days prior to embryo death. Rickettsial MDH was differentiated from host MDH by its migration pattern on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activities of MDH and two other dehydrogenases, demonstrable after the cells had been disrupted, were absent from purified, intact rickettsial preparations. No activity was detected for glucose-6-phosphate, 6-phosphogluconate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, lactate dehydrogenases, phosphoglucose isomerase, fructoaldolase, or pyruvate kinase. Our results suggest that extracts of R. typhi that contain demonstrable enzymes involved in the catabolism of glutamate and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, unlike Coxiella burnetti, lack detectable glycolytic activity.
