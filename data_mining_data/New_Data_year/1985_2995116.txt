The livers of streptozotocin-induced diabetic and fasted rats showed a decreased cholesterol synthesis measured by in vitro incorporation of [2-14C]acetate. A significant decrease of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), and pyruvate kinase (PK) was also observed 7 days after administration of streptozotocin. These enzymatic activities were also low in livers of 72 hr fasted animals. An increase of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) was observed consistently in diabetic as well as in fasted rats. Suitable amounts of insulin and refeeding normalized the alterated enzymatic activities in diabetic and in fasted animals, respectively.
