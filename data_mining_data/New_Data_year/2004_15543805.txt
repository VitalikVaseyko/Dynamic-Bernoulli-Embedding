Energy metabolism is affected in hypoxia-ischemia. Changes in the tissue concentrations of the high-energy phosphate reserves occur early during the course of the metabolic insult and with concurrent increases in cellular ADP and AMP leading glycolysis. It has been shown that enzymes of glycolysis tend to be regulated in hypoxia and ischemia. In this study we determined pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, one of the main enzymes in glycolysis, in brain tissues of healthy (n = 15) and hypoxic-ischemic (n = 18) 7-day-old newborn rats. Left common carotid artery was ligated in the hypoxic-ischemic group and after 2 hours rats were exposed to hypoxia in a chamber at 34-36 degrees C with 8% oxygen in nitrogen. The rats were decapitated after 2 hours of hypoxia and right and left cerebral hemispheres (CH) and cerebellum-brain stem (C-BS) were removed. Pyruvate kinase activity was significantly higher in C-BSs than CHs in both groups (p < 0.00005). There was no significant difference in enzyme activities of either CHs or C-BS of hypoxic-ischemic group compared to control healthy group (p > 0.05). In conclusion, brain pyruvate kinase activity did not change in hypoxia-ischemia and suggests that PK of brain differs from other tissues where it usually increases in hypoxiaischemia.
