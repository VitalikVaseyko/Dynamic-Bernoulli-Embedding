Serum iron, hemoglobin, and reticulocytes were determined in 134 patients with hemolytic anemia (hereditary spherocytosis, pyruvate kinase- or glucose-phosphate isomerase deficiency, hemolytic anemia due to warm auto antibodies, cold agglutinin disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglubinuria, hemolytic uremic syndrome). No correlation was found between iron concentration and degree of hemolysis. Only a few patients show a marked increase of serum iron.
