The effect of deficiencies of zinc or copper in the rat on the activity of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase in erythrocytes, liver and muscle was investigated. The data showed no effect of either zinc or copper deficiencies on the activity of these enzymes in the tissues tested. It is concluded that these enzymes are not useful markers for either zinc or copper deficiency.
