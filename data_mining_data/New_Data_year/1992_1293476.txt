This paper presents the effects of combined exposure (noise, dust, nitrogen oxides) on the health condition of industrial workers, with special regard to red blood cell metabolism. 208 male industrial plant workers of the average age of 38.5 +/- 8.27 years and the average work period of 14.7 +/- 8.22 years were examined. The statistically significant increase of methemoglobin level was detected as well as some changes in erythrocyte metabolism in terms of increased activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and in vitro production of lactic acid in erythrocytes. The observed changes indicate the influence of exposure to nitrogen oxides and the resulting cellular adaptation to unfavourable working conditions (activation of the pentose cycle and of the final stage of anaerobic glycolysis cycle).
