The effect of fatigue (running to exhaustion) on the Vmax activity of the key glycolytic enzymes measured at saturating substrate concentrations in muscles, liver and brain of sedentary and trained (running on a treadmill one h/day at 20 m/min, five days/week for six months) female Zucker fatty rats and their lean littermates was investigated. In the sedentary rats, fatigue increased the activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK) in the red vastus muscle by 82% in lean, and 120% in obese rats. In the trained rats, fatigue increased PFK activity by 28% in the white vastus muscle of lean rats. In the lean animals, hexokinase (HK) activity was decreased by 26% in the red vastus of sedentary rats, and by 29% in the white vastus of trained rats upon fatiguing. Pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was also decreased by 29% in the white vastus of fatigued lean animals. Training by itself had no effect on the activity of glycolytic enzymes, except PK activity which was increased by 27% in the cortex of the lean animals. It is concluded that in the Zucker rat, these glycolytic enzymes may play a differential role in regulating glycolysis during exercise and fatigue; the extent of their involvement differs depending upon the type of tissue studied and exercise. In view of the reported short half-life (7-17 h) of PFK and its covalent modification, it is suggested that the total content and/or phosphorylation status of the enzyme may be affected in animals subjected to long-term fatigue.
