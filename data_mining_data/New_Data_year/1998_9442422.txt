At 9 mM glucose, experimental results show that mitochondrial phosphate depletion (induced by glucose phosphorylation, catalyzed by mitochondrial hexokinase) reduces the activities of the respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation, and glutaminase. Consequently, the 14C-lactate oxidation to 14CO2 is lowered in the presence of glucose. The fall of ATP level triggers a high aerobic glycolysis by deinhibiting fructose-6-P kinase. NADH, generated by enhanced glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase activity, increases the reducing power. Moreover, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) system is shifted toward lactate formation, while NAD+ is regenerated and the oligomycin-inhibited ATP production is replaced by the iodoacetate-inhibited ATP production. From 14CO2 production and lactate accumulation it is calculated that about 60% of 14C-glucose which disappears is channelled into extraglycolytic reactions. On the contrary, 82% of glucose below l mM is metabolized through non-glycolytic reactions. The pyruvate kinase-M2 (PK-M2) inhibition does not limit the glycolytic flow from 9 mM glucose, but it may cause sustained gluconeogenesis.
