Biotin-dependent carboxylases are widely distributed in nature and have central roles in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and other compounds. The last decade has seen the accumulation of structural information on most of these large holoenzymes, including the 500-kDa dimeric yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the 750-kDa alpha6beta6 dodecameric bacterial propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and geranyl-CoA carboxylase, the 720-kDa hexameric bacterial long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase, the 500-kDa tetrameric bacterial single-chain pyruvate carboxylase, the 370-kDa alpha2beta4 bacterial two-subunit pyruvate carboxylase, and the 130-kDa monomeric eukaryotic urea carboxylase. A common theme that has emerged from these studies is the dramatic structural flexibility of these holoenzymes despite their strong overall sequence conservation, evidenced both by the extensive diversity in the architectures of the holoenzymes and by the extensive conformational variability of their domains and subunits. This structural flexibility is crucial for the function and regulation of these enzymes and identifying compounds that can interfere with it represents an attractive approach for developing novel modulators and drugs. The extensive diversity observed in the structures so far and its biochemical and functional implications will be the focus of this review.
