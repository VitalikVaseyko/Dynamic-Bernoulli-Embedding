In response to a program of daily swimming for 16 weeks, the activities of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase increased significantly in the hearts of young male rats. The isozyme composition in M of cardial lactate dehydrogenase increased from 28.5 to 32.7% in the trained animals. Phosphofructokinase activity and glycogen content were unchanged. The hearts of the exercising animals were 28% heavier than those of sedentary paired weight controls.
