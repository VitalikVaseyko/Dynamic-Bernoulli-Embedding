This paper follows the development in the activity of the key enzymes of glycolysis and dehydrogenases of the pentose phosphate shunt throughout the in vitro growth and metacyclogenesis of two human strains of Leishmania infantum - one visceral (VL) and the other cutaneous (CL) - together with changes in the glucose, ammonium, and proton concentrations in the culture medium. In the first stage, ammonium was generated and no glucose was consumed. Later on, all the glucose was consumed and, finally, ammonium was generated again. The ammonium concentration increased 16- and 21-fold in cultures of VL and CL strains, respectively. The activities of the glycosomal enzymes hexokinase and phosphofructokinase differed in each strain, always being higher in CL than in VL and increasing throughout the culture period in CL while decreasing in VL. This probably indicates a different capability to adapt to the culture medium conditions. The activities of the pentose phosphate shunt enzymes examined indicate that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is possibly a rate-limiting enzyme for this pathway. Pyruvate kinase is a cytosolic control enzyme of glycolysis in trypanosomatids, and its activity decreased throughout the growth and differentiation of both strains of L. infantum, as occurs in other trypanosomatids. It was also observed that glucose catabolism was more active in the cutaneous strain than in the visceral one.
