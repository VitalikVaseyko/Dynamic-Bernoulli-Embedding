Exposure of L929 murine fibroblasts to ozone resulted in K+ leakage and inhibition of several enzymes. Most sensitive to ozone exposure were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. The activities of another cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, the mitochondrial enzymes glutamate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and the activity of the lysosomal enzymes acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were, initially, not or only slightly affected. The localization of the lysosomal enzymes did not change during ozone exposure. After prolonged exposure complete deterioration of the cells was observed and all enzyme activities declined. The activity of the enzymes was also monitored during ozone exposure of a sonicated cell suspension and it was shown that all these enzymes are in fact susceptible to ozone. These observations clearly demonstrate that, besides the structure and amino acid composition of an enzyme, the localization in the cell plays an important role in its susceptibility to ozone. The intracellular levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were affected as well. The ATP content, however, proved to be insensitive to ozone exposure.
