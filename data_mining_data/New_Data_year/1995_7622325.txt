Infective (L3) larvae of Strongyloides ratti (homogonic strain) were freeze-clamped (-196 degrees C) and the steady-state content of the glycolytic, Krebs tricarboxylic acid (KTA)-cycle intermediates and adenine nucleotides analysed. Comparison of the mass-action ratios (MARs) of the glycolytic enzymes with their apparent equilibrium constants (K9eq) indicate that phosphoglucomutase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglyceromutase and phosphopyruvate hydratase reactions were all at or near equilibrium, whilst hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were displaced from equilibrium. The S. ratti aldolase and myokinase appear to be somewhat displaced from equilibrium and thus may have pseudoregulatory roles. The adenylate energy charge (AEC), ATP/ADP ratio and the available adenylate energy (AAE) indices were 0.9 +/- 0.04, 8.76 +/- 1.5 and 397 +/- 43, respectively. The free [NAD+]/[NADH+H+] ratio of the cytoplasmic compartment of S. ratti L3 larvae calculated employing the steady-state content of the oxidised and reduced substrates of lactate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.27) and the combined glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.2.1.12)/3-phosphoglycerate kinase (E.C. 2.7.2.3) system were ca. 523 and 1200, respectively. The free[NAD+]/[NADH+H+] ratio in the mitochondrial compartment of S. ratti L3 larvae calculated using the malate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.37) equilibrium was found to be 1962:1. The data is discussed with respect to the predominantly aerobic nature of the energy metabolism of the L3 larvae.
