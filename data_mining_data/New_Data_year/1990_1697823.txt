174 serum ferritin assays in 121 patients with various haemolytic disorders have been performed. The mean serum ferritin levels were significantly increased in all these disorders in contrast to healthy controls. The highest serum ferritin levels were found in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, moderate increase was observed in hereditary sphaerocytosis (HS) and in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) with massive haemolysis and in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Mild elevation of serum ferritin levels was depicted in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), in beta thalassaemia minor and in other types of haemoglobinopathies. The range of values was associated with a degree of haemolysis and its relation to duration of the disease was not apparent in most cases. Highly significant differences between serum ferritin levels in splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients with HS and between serum ferritin levels in patients with AIHA with massive haemolysis or in remission were found. As compared to normal controls, significant increase of serum ferritin levels was observed even in patients with AIHA in remission or in splenectomized patients with HS. In two patients with PK deficiency the levels exceeding 2,000 micrograms/l indicated manifest iron overload. A reliability of serum ferritin assay as an index of iron stores in haemolytic disorders has been discussed.
