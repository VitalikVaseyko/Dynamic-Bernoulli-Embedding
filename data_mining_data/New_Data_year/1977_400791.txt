Yeast strains carrying recessive mutations representing four different loci that cause defects in pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and 3-phosphoglycerate mutase were isolated and partially characterized. Cells carrying these mutations were unable to use glucose as a carbon source as measured in turbidimetric growth experiments. Tetrad analysis indicated that these mutations were not linked to each other; one of the mutations, that affecting phosphoglycerate kinase, was located on chromosome III.
