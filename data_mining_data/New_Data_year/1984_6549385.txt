Livers were obtained from two lines of domestic broiler which had been selected for low (lean) and high (fat) plasma very-low-density lipoprotein concentration over three generations. The fat line possessed significantly higher hepatic specific activities of malate dehydrogenase (NADP), ATP citrate lyase and fatty acid synthase, and lower glucose bisphosphatase than the lean line. The glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase, were similar and so was the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. This recently discovered metabolic regulator was present at somewhat higher concentrations than previously reported in rats or mice. It exhibited a positive correlation with phosphofructokinase activity (only data for the fat line are shown), and stimulated enzyme activity when added to crude preparations.
