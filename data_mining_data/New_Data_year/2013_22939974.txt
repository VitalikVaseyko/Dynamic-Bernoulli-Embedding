Metabolic derangements and bioenergetic failure are major contributors to sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunctions. Due to the well known role of magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions that involve energy creation and utilization, the present investigation was directed to estimate the cardioprotective effect of Mg supplementation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced metabolic energy changes in mice. Oral doses of Mg aspartate (20 or 40 mg/kg) were administered once daily for 7 day. Mice were then subjected to a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (2 mg/kg). Plasma was separated 3 h after LPS injection for determination of creatine kinase-MB activity. Animals were then sacrificed and the hearts were separated for estimation of tissue thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione, lactate, pyruvate, adenine nucleotides, creatine phosphate and cardiac Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Finally, electron microscopic examination was performed to visualize the protective effects of Mg pretreatment on mitochondrial ultrastructure. In general, the higher dose of Mg was more effective than the lower dose in ameliorating creatine kinase-MB elevation and the state of oxidative stress, lactate accumulation, pyruvate reduction as well as preserving creatine phosphate, adenine nucleotides and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. Moreover, the higher dose of Mg provided a significant cardioprotection against the mitochondrial ultrastructural changes. Mg therapy can afford a significant protection against metabolic energy derangements and mitochondrial ultrastructural changes induced by LPS cardiotoxicity in mice.
