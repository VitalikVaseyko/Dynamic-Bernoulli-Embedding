Red cell enzymes of three children with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood were measured and compared with those of age-matched normal children and children with hemolytic anemia. While the activity of "age-dependent" enzyme such as hexokinase, aldolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, and pyruvate kinase were greatly increased in the red cells of children with hemolytic anemia, they were not decreased in the red cells of children with erythroblastopenia of childhood. Only the activity of pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase was consistently low red cells of these children. These findings are inconsistent with the usual concept that red cell enzyme activities decline throughout red cell life span. Rather, they suggest that there may be very rapid loss in the activity of some red cell enzymes during the first few days of red cell life with little further decline in enzyme activity.
