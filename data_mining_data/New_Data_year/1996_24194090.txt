The composition of seminal plasma and metabolism of sperm of the cyprinid fishAlburnus alburnus were investigated. Statistically significant correlations were found between motility parameters and seminal fluid osmolality, pH, Na(+), K(+) and protein levels (negative correlations: % immotile spermatozoa-Na(+), K(+); positive correlations: % motile spermatozoa-osmolality, pH, Na(+), K(+), protein; % linear motile spermatozoa-pH protein; swimming velocity of spermatozoa-pH, Na(+), protein). Spermatozoan motility and ATP metabolism and glycolysis were correlated as indicated by measurement of ATPase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. The physiological meanings of these correlations and their possible significance for quality control of semen are discussed.
