(Z)-3-Chlorophosphoenolpyruvate has been synthesized by the reaction of 3,3-dichloropyruvic acid with trimethylphosphite, followed by deesterification. This compound is a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate kinase is not inactivated upon prolonged incubation with the compound, but phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is slowly inactivated (t1/2 = 5 h). The compound is a substrate for both enzymes, being acted upon by pyruvate kinase approximately 0.1% as rapidly as phosphoenolpyruvate itself. In the case of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, the compound is converted into a 3:1 mixture of chloropyruvate and chlorooxalacetate, at an overall rate that is about 25% the carboxylation rate for phosphoenolpyruvate.
