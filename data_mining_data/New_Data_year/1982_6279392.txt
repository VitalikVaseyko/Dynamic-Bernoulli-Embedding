Activities of glycolytic enzymes in the aorta were investigated in female Wistar rats. There were two groups of rats; one served as the control (sedentary rats), while the other group was forced to run on a treadmill for 10 weeks. In the control animals, the activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and aldolase were relatively lower than those of the other glycolytic enzymes (phosphoglucose isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase). After exercise, the activity of phosphofructokinase increased by 15%, whereas the other enzymatic activities were much the same as in the controls. Within the limits of the experiments, the increased percentage of phosphofructokinase was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Since phosphofructokinase is a putative rate limiting enzyme, this enzymatic activation may indicate that glycolytic activity in the rat aorta is enhanced during and after running exercise.
