The effect of glucose concentration and insulin on glucose incorporation was studied in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. The rate of glucose incorporation into hepatocytes was proportional to the medium glucose concentration from 100 to 800 mg/dl. At 800 mg/dl glucose the rate reached a plateau. Of the glucose taken up by hepatocytes, 16 and 18% was incorporated into glycogen and lipid, respectively, and 58% into the nucleotide fraction after incubation for 4 h. In the medium, lactate was the major product found. Insulin stimulates glucose incorporation by 20-112% into all the above pathways at glucose concentrations between 100 and 800 mg/dl. The insulin effect was noted as early as 2-4 h (early effect) and up to 24 h (delayed effect). This effect of insulin was observed to be dose dependent from 5 to 200 ng/ml insulin. While the delayed insulin effect was abolished by cycloheximide, the early effect of insulin was not affected. With respect to the key enzyme activities of glucose utilization, activation of glycogen synthase (increase of I-activity/total activity) and pyruvate kinase (activation at 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate) was noted 4 h after insulin addition, and these effects were not abolished by cycloheximide. These two enzymes increased in total activity after 24 h. Both glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities increased by 30-35% and 65-93% at 4 and 24 h, respectively. The results indicate that hepatocytes directly utilize glucose in a dose-dependent manner with respect to glucose and insulin. A major early and delayed effect of insulin appeared due to the activation and induction of the key hepatic enzymes of glucose utilization, respectively.
