The kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from Streptococcus lactis have been investigated. Positive homotropic kinetics were observed with phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate, resulting in a sigmoid relationship between reaction velocity and substrate concentrations. This relationship was abolished with an excess of the heterotropic effector fructose-1,6-diphosphate, giving a typical Michaelis-Menten relationship. Increasing the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate increased the apparent V(max) values and decreased the K(m) values for both substrates. Catalysis by pyruvate kinase proceeded optimally at pH 6.9 to 7.5 and was markedly inhibited by inorganic phosphate and sulfate ions. Under certain conditions adenosine 5'-triphosphate also caused inhibition. The K(m) values for phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate in the presence of 2 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate were 0.17 mM and 1 mM, respectively. The concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate giving one-half maximal velocity with 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 5 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate was 0.07 mM. The intracellular concentrations of these metabolites (0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.4 mM adenosine 5'-diphosphate, and 18 mM fructose-1,6-diphosphate) suggest that the pyruvate kinase in S. lactis approaches maximal activity in exponentially growing cells. The role of pyruvate kinase in the regulation of the glycolytic pathway in lactic streptococci is discussed.
