Pyruvate kinase, purified from flounder liver, in two forms, i.e. PK I and PK II, is characterized by sigmoid kinetics with phosphoenolpyruvate as substrate at pH 6.3, 6.7 and 7.7. K0.5 for PEP increases with increasing pH. PK I and PK II show hyperbolic kinetics with ADP, but are inhibited by ADP concentrations above 1-2 mM. K0.5 for ADP decreases with increasing pH. PK I and PK II differ in their K0.5 values for PEP with a factor of at least 2, showing the highest figures for the latter. K0.5 for ADP is about the same for the two enzyme forms. Other nucleotide diphosphates can replace ADP as the substrate. When the nucleoside diphosphates are arranged in a rank order showing decreasing effectiveness as substrate, different rank orders are obtained for PK I and PK II.
