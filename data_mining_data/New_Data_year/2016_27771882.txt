The present study analyzes a battery of biomarkers in the water bug Belostoma elegans from a stream polluted with organic matter (OMS), and another one considered as reference site (RS) during spring-summer season (December to March). Biochemical parameters of glucidic, lipidic and oxidative metabolic pathways were analyzed in males and females of this insect. In general, no significant differences were observed in all biomarkers assayed between both sexes, except lactate concentration which was higher in males than in females (p < 0.0006) in the first three months. About carbohydrate metabolism parameters, only pyruvate-kinase showed significant differences between insects collected in both streams (p < 0.05) during December. However, the total lipid content, saturated fatty acid, and mainly triacylglycerol were higher in insects from RS compared to those from OMS (p < 0.002) in all sampled months. Levels of lipoperoxidation, protein oxidation, reduced glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase activity showed no differences between insects collected from both streams. Nevertheless, the significant increase observed in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities (p < 0.004) could be due to the elevated oxidative metabolism in insects from RS compared to those from OMS with lower dissolved oxygen. Regarding those responding parameters, males accounted for the differences between the two sites during the study period. In conclusion, our results support that lipidic energetic reserves and antioxidant enzyme activities in B. elegans could be used as biomarkers of environmental pollution by organic matter.
