Automated analyses were used to determine the effect of retinol on the activity of the following proteolytic enzymes: ficin (EC 3.4.4.12), bromelain (EC 3.4.4. 24), trypsin (EC 3.4.4.4.), chymotrypsin A (EC 3.4.4.5), papain (EC 3.4.4.10), clostridiopeptidase A (EC 3.4.4.19), pepsin (EC 3.4.4.1), cathepsin D (EC 3.4.4. 23) from rat-liver and rat-kidney lysosomes and the nonspecific proteolytic enzyme, pronase. Of these proteolytic enzymes only ficin, bromelain, and rat-kidney lysosomal cathepsin D were inhibited significantly by 1x10(-4) M retinol.Some nonproteolytic enzymes not inhibited by retinol were acid phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.2), beta-acetylglucosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.30), arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1), and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). The inhibition of cathepsin D varied with the substrate used, being greater with hemoglobin than with ovalbumin or bovine serum albumin. Carotene and retinol inhibited ficin and cathepsin D to similar extents. Retinol inhibition of ficin was partially reversible. These studies of proteolytic enzyme inhibition by retinol serve as a simple model for studying retinol-protein interactions in vitro.
