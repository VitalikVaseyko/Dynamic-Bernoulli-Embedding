A comparative study on the glycolytic enzymes from chicken erythrocytes and somatic tissues has been carried out, the results being shown as active units per mg protein in supernatants of 1085, 12,100 and 106,000 g fractionated centrifugation. The profiles of the glycolytic enzymes have been analyzed in terms of their activity relative to hexokinase and as the ratios between pairs of enzymes bearing a product-substrate relationship. Chicken erythrocyte displays a very peculiar profile of glycolytic enzymes. It possesses a FruP2-activated pyruvate kinase of the L isoenzyme type, which does not seem to be the predominant isoenzyme together with the M type, the content in glycolytic enzymes being much lower than in the somatic tissues.
