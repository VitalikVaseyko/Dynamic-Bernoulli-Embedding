Hexokinase I was purified from rabbit heart to a specific activity of 70 U/mg protein. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous with an apparent molecular weight of 102,000. Purified immunoglobulins from sheep were used to titrate the percentage of hexokinase I in various tissues of the rabbit. Precipitating antibodies from sheep were also prepared against rabbit muscle MM-creatine kinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Apparent turnover rates of these phosphotransferases and of hexokinase I were determined in rabbit heart and soleus muscle by means of the immunoprecipitation technique after single pulse labelling with [U-14Cl]leucine in vivo. Apparent half-lives of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and hexokinase I were 0.56 d, 0.73 d and 0.93 d in rabbit heart. In slow-twitch soleus muscle half-lives of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase II and creatine kinase were 0.63 d, 0.72 d, 0.85 d and 0.82 d. The similarity of the rate constants of degradation of these enzymes is interpreted as an indication that different tissue concentrations result primarily from different rates of synthesis.
