Thioacetamide (400 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) was administered to rats. After 12 h the activity of plasma glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) was significantly higher than that of the control group, and after 24 h plasma GOT and GPT activities strongly increased. These results indicated that the necrotic process was initiated at about 12 h and developed thereafter. By co-administration of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 18 and 1 h before, and 8 h after administration of thioacetamide: each time, 2.5 ml/kg body weight, p.o.), plasma GOT and GPT were significantly decreased and were even comparable to the control group, showing that DMSO totally prevented the necrotic action of thioacetamide. After 12 and 24 h of thioacetamide administration, the hepatic level of vitamin C, the most sensitive chemical indicator of oxidative stress, decreased significantly, indicating that oxidative stress was significantly enhanced 12 h after thioacetamide intoxication and thereafter. DMSO totally restored the liver vitamin C level, demonstrating that DMSO effectively ameliorated the oxidative stress caused by thioacetamide, resulting in the prevention of necrosis of the liver. Phosphorylated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased transiently 12 h after treatment with thioacetamide. These results indicated that oxidative stress and the activation of JNK took place almost simultaneously. Phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 2 was significantly increased 6-12 h after thioacetamide injection. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) was significantly decreased 24 h after administration of thioacetamide. DMSO treatment inhibited the change of these MAPKs by thioacetamide, corresponding with the prevention of the liver necrosis as well as the attenuation of oxidative stress.
