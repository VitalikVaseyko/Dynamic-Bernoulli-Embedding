Effects of glucose concentration and anoxia upon the metabolite concentrations and rates of glycolysis and respiration have been investigated in the perfused liver of the fetal guinea pig. In most cases the metabolite concentrations in the perfused liver were similar to those observed in vivo. Between 50 days and term there was a fall in the respiratory rate and in the concentration of ATP and fructose 1,6-diphosphate and an increase in the concentration of glutamate, glycogen and glucose. Reducing the medium glucose concentration from 10 mM to 1 mM or 0.1 mM depressed lactate production and the concentration of most of the phosphorylated intermediates (except 6-phosphogluconate) in the liver of the 50-day fetus. This indicates a fall in glycolytic rate which is not in accord with the known kinetic properties of hexokinase in the fetal liver. Anoxia increased lactate production by, and the concentrations of, the hexose phosphates ADP and AMP in the 50-day to term fetal liver, while the concentration of ribulose 5-phosphate, ATP and some triose phosphates fell. These results are consistent with an activation of glycolysis, particularly at phosphofructokinase and of a reduction in pentose phosphate pathway activity, particularly at 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The calculated cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio for the perfused liver was similar to that measured in vivo and evidence is presented to suggest that the dihydroxyacetone phosphate/glycerol 3-phosphate ratio gives a better indication of cytosolic redox than the lactate/pyruvate ratio. The present observations indicate that phosphofructokinase hexokinase and possibly pyruvate kinase control the glycolytic rate and that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is at equilibrium in the perfused liver of the fetal guinea pig.
