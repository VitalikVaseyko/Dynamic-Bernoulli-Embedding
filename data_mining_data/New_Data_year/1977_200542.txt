A cAMP-independent protein kinase from chicken liver phosphorylated and inactivated pyruvate kinase type M2 from the same tissue. Complete inactivation was reached when 4 mol of phosphate were incorporated/mol of tetrameric pyruvate kinase. The protein kinase bound with high affinity to pyruvate kinase type M2 (Km value for pyruvate kinase = 6 X 10(-10)M; it phosphorylated phosvitin and casein but not histones, ATP and GTP were substrates. The differences between the properties of this protein kinase in the interconversion of pyruvate kinase and that described previously are discussed.
