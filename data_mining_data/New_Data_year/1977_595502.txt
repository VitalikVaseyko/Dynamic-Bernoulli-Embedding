A time-consuming procedure of isolation of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes from rabbit kidney cortex (more than 5 hrs) at 0-2 degrees led to obtaining of a desensitized form of "L" type, resembling the "M3" type of the enzyme from sceletal muscle. Rapid isolation of pyruvate kinase "L" type (within about 2.5 hrs) at 4-6 degrees provided the isoenzyme in the active (allosteric) form.
