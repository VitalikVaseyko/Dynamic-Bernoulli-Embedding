Nicotinic acid (NA; or niacin) has been used as a hypolipidemic agent for more than 4 decades. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of NA treatment (wanted and unwanted) are still poorly understood. In the present study, we discovered that NA infusion in rats resulted in dephosphorylation (ie, activation) of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal and cardiac muscles, liver, and adipose tissue. These NA effects were opposite to the effects of insulin to increase FOXO1 phosphorylation. To test whether NA alters gene expression in these tissues, rats were infused for 7 hours with NA (30 mumol/h) and/or insulin (5 mU/[kg min]); and gene expression was evaluated using a microarray analysis. Nicotinic acid had widespread effects on gene expression in all of the tissues studied, and the number of genes affected by NA greatly exceeded that of genes affected by insulin. A systematic (or strategic) analysis of the microarray data revealed that there were numerous genes whose expression was regulated inversely by insulin and NA in correlation with FOXO1 phosphorylation, representing potential FOXO1 target genes. We also identified a group of genes whose expression was altered by NA exclusively in adipose tissue, presumably because of stimulation of the NA receptor in this tissue. Finally, there were genes whose expression was altered by both NA and insulin, likely via lowering plasma free fatty acid levels, including lipoprotein lipase and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette A1, which play a major role in the regulation of circulating lipids. Thus, our data suggest that NA alters gene expression in insulin-sensitive tissues by various mechanisms. Some of the NA-induced changes in gene expression are discussed as potential mechanisms underlying wanted and unwanted effects of NA treatment.
