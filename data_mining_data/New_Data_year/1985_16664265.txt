Young bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var Saxa) were fed with 3.5 or 10 millimolar N in either the form of NO(3) (-) or NH(4) (+), after being grown on N-free nutrient solution for 8 days. The pH of the nutrient solutions was either 6 or 4. The cell sap pH and the extractable activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and of pyruvate kinase from roots and primary leaves were measured over several days.The extractable activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (based on soluble protein) from primary leaves increased with NO(3) (-) nutrition, whereas with NH(4) (+) nutrition and on N-free nutrient solution the activity remained at a low level. Phosphoenopyruvate carboxylase activity from the roots of NH(4) (+)-fed plants at pH 4 was finally somewhat higher than from the roots of plants grown on NO(3) (-) at the same pH. There was no difference in activity from the root between the N treatments when pH in the nutrient solutions was 6. The extractable activity of pyruvate kinase from roots and primary leaves seemed not to be influenced by the N nutrition of the plants.The results are discussed in relation to the physiological function of both enzymes with special regard to the postulated functions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase in C3 plants as an anaplerotic enzyme and as part of a cellular pH stat.
