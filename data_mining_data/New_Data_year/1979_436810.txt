Pyruvate kinase isozymes in rat small intestine changed markedly during the postnatal period. The activities of type M2 subunits rapidly increased before weaning, while those of type L subunits decreased slightly. The administration of hydrocortisone induced normal changes prematurely, whereas the administration of thyroxine increased their extent. On simultaneous administration, the two hormones had synergistic effects.
