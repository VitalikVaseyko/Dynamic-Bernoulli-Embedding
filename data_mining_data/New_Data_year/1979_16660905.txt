In the growing chloronema cell suspension cultures of the moss Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., activities of several enzymes have been found to be cell-density-dependent. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cNPDE), nitrate reductase (NR), and protein kinase showed highest activity at a low cell density (1 to 2 milligrams per milliliter) while indoleacetic acid (IAA) oxidase and peroxidase were highest at a high cell density (>10 milligrams per milliliter). 3'-Nucleotidase and the glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, pyruvate kinase, and triose phosphate isomerase) showed no significant dependence on the cell density. Alternatively, if the NR and peroxidase activities were determined as a function of time in batch cultures, their levels were maximal 60 to 70 and 320 hours after subculture, respectively, the corresponding cell densities being 1 to 2 and 23 milligrams per milliliter. The relationship between cell density and NR and peroxidase activities is the same, whether these enzymes are measured in batch cultures during a growth cycle or in the cells cultured at different initial inoculum densities for a constant time. Conventionally enzymic changes have been correlated with growth phases; however, it is felt that the pattern of enzymic activities can also be interpreted as cell-density-dependent.In moss protonema, the dependence of cNPDE, IAA oxidase, and peroxidase on cell density may play an important role in modulating the endogenous levels of IAA and cAMP, both of which regulate the differentiation of specific cell types (Johri and Desai 1973 Nature New Biol 245: 223-224; and Handa and Johri 1976 Nature 259: 480-482).
