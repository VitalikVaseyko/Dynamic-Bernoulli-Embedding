Vitamin E owes its biological effects to its antioxidant activity. Kinetic and mechanistic studies on phenolic antioxidants in vitro have led us to design and synthesize all-rac-2,4,6,7-tetramethyl-2-(4',8',12'-trimethyltridecyl) -5-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrobenzofuran, 3. In the rat curative myopathy bioassay the acetate of this compound has 1.5-1.9 times the bioactivity of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol acetate. This represents the first time that a rationally designed synthetic 'vitamin' has been found to have more activity in vivo than the corresponding natural vitamin.
