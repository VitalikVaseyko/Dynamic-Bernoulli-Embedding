The effect of estradiol-17 beta on the activities of glycolytic enzymes from female rat brain was studied. The following enzymes were examined: hexokinase (HK, EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (PFK, EC 2.7.1.11), aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3), enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) and pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40). The activities of HK (soluble and membrane-bound), PFK and PK were increased after 4 h of hormone treatment, while the others remained constant. The changes in activity were not seen in the presence of actinomycin D. The significant rise of the activities of the key glycolytic enzymes was also observed in the cell culture of mouse neuroblastoma C1300 treated with hormone. Only three of the studied isozymes, namely, HKII, B4 and K4 were found to be estradiol-sensitive for HK, PFK and PK, respectively. The results obtained suggest that rat brain glycolysis regulation by estradiol is carried out in neurons due to definite isozymes induction.
