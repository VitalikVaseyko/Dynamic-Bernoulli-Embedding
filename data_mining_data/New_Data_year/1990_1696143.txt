In the present work methods for the localization of glucose-6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate residues on tissue sections by means of labeled with colloidal gold specific enzymes (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) are described. In order to get sufficient amount of labeled enzyme to the protein salts, used to stabilize colloidal gold salts, albumin was added. Residues of glucose-6-phosphoenolpyruvate were scattered equally through the villi of human placenta. In rat liver centrolobular localized hepatocytes had high content of specific staining. There were a lot of glucose-6-phosphate residues in hepatocytes nuclei.
