1. The kinetic characteristics of pyruvate kinase isozymes from oocytes, embryos, liver and skeletal muscle from the clawed frog Xenopus laevis were measured in cell extracts. 2. The muscle and liver isozymes display Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Kms for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) of 0.02 and 0.05 mM, respectively. 3. Pyruvate kinase from oocytes and embryos displays cooperative kinetics for PEP with a Km of about 0.15 mM; the kinetics become hyperbolic and the Km for PEP is reduced to 0.05 mM in the presence of microM concentrations of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. 4. These data serve to characterize pyruvate kinase activity in oocytes and embryos and the kinetics are compared to mammalian pyruvate kinase isozymes.
