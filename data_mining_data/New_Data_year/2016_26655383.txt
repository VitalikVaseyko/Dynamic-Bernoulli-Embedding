We hypothesized that alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) might interact with the transcriptional control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)beta in skeletal muscle. Molecular mechanisms were investigated using differentiated C2C12 myotubes treated with alpha-LA and/or PPARbeta agonist GW0742. In vivo studies with 3-mo-old C57Bl6 mice were realized: voluntary wheel running (VWR) training (7 wk), and a 6 wk diet containing (or not) alpha-LA (0.25% wt/wt). This last condition was combined with (or not) 1 bout of treadmill exercise (18 m/min for 1 h). Using a reporter assay, we demonstrate that alpha-LA is not an agonist of PPARbeta but regulates PPARbeta target gene expression through an active PPARbeta pathway. GW0742-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA is potentiated by alpha-LA. In C2C12, alpha-LA lowers the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and increases PPARbeta mRNA and protein levels (2-fold) to the same extent as with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Similarly to VWR training effect, PPARbeta expression increases (2-fold) in vastus lateralis of animals fed an alpha-LA-enriched diet. However, alpha-LA treatment does not further stimulate the adaptive up-regulation of PPARbeta observed in response to 1 bout of exercise. We have identified a novel mechanism of regulation of PPARbeta expression/action in skeletal muscle with potential physiologic application through the action of alpha-LA, involving the JNK pathway.
