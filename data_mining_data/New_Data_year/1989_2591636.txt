1. Pyruvate kinase type M1 was purified from bovine brain about 241-fold with 38% yield. 2. Specific activity of the enzyme was above 217 U/mg of protein (25 degrees C), relative mol. wt of the subunit--57,000 (+/- 2000) and pH optimum--6.8-7.2. 3. The enzyme shoved hyperbolic kinetics with Km value for PEP of 0.04 mM and for ADP of 0.3 mM. 4. Inorganic phosphate and ATP at concentrations below 4 mM showed activating effect, 1-phenylalanine and ATP above 6 mM--an inhibiting effect on the enzyme. 5. Inhibition by 1-phenylalanine was prevented by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
