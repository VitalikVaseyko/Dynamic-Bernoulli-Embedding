ADP is known to be easily determined spectrophotometrically after it is utilized to produce the corresponding amount of NAD by combined reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. We studied whether CDP and UDP can be also determined in a similar manner if they were incubated for a longer period with an increased amount of pyruvate kinase. It was shown that CDP and UDP could be utilized to produce the corresponding amount of NADH oxidized after an incubation of at least 25 min and that 0 to 300 nmols of these nucleotides were able to be determined spectrophotometrically.
