Novel agents are still urgently expected for therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The in vitro anti-leukemia activity of Stellettin B (Stel B), a triterpenoid we isolated from marine sponge Jaspis stellifera, on human CML K562 and KU812 cells was recently investigated. Stel B inhibited K562 and KU812 cell proliferation with IC50 as 0.035 muM and 0.95 muM respectively. While no obvious cell cycle arrest was observed, apoptosis was induced in K562 cells after Stel B treatment. The Stel B-induced apoptosis might be in mitochondrial pathway, with increase of Bad and Bax, decrease of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-9. In addition, dose-dependent increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) occurred. Meanwhile, Stel B inhibited phosphorylation of Stat5, expression of 4 PI3K catalytic isoforms, and phosphorylation of the downstream effectors including PDK1 and Akt, suggesting that inhibition against Stat5 and PI3K might be involved in the apoptosis-inducing effect. Combination of Stel B with Imatinib with ratio as IC50 Stel B : 5xIC50 Imatinib led to synergistic effect. Stel B might become a promising candidate for CML therapy alone or together with Imatinib.
