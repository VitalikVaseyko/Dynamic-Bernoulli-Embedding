We studied cultures of human skeletal muscle in vitro and established standards for biochemical markers of cellular differentiation. DNA synthesis ceased at the time of fusion, implying the absence of fibroblasts. Myosin heavy-chain synthesis, creatine and pyruvate kinase activities, and isoenzymes of creatine kinase were measured serially over 36 days. Filamin and fibronectin proteins were identified in these cultures. Compared to chick muscle in culture, human skeletal muscle cells remained relatively immature. These data provide a basis for the study of diseased human muscle cells in culture.
