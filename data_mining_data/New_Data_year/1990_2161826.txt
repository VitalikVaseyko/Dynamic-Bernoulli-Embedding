We have developed an in vitro model of human papillary collecting duct cells isolated from cadaver kidneys using methods similar to those we previously reported for the isolation of human proximal tubule cells. To date we have isolated papillary collecting duct cells from 100 normal human kidneys. Papillae were dissected and digested in Cellgro containing 400 U/ml collagenase. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated culture flasks at a density of 10(4) live cells/ml in Cellgro supplemented with insulin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent monolayers, which were able to withstand 600 mOSM for 8 h, were obtained within 10 to 15 d. Cells of primary isolates and first passages exhibited epithelial cell ultrastructure including cell junctions, microvilli, and cilia. A dark-brown reaction product was observed in these cells when stained by the immunoperoxidase method with peroxidase-labeled peanut lectin (Arachis hypogaea), which binds specifically to human distal tubule and collecting duct cells. These cells were negative for Factor-VIII (a marker for endothelial cells) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (a marker for proximal tubule cells). High activities of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase and arginine vasopressin-stimulated cAMP production in these cells are consistent with a distal nephron origin. The results indicate that human collecting duct cells can be isolated and cultured to provide an in vitro system to probe pathogenetic mechanisms of potential nephrotoxins.
