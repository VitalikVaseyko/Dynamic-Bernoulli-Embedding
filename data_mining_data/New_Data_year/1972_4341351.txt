The rate coefficient for (22)Na release from previously labeled human erythrocytes was determined in the presence of 0.1-10 mM sodium fluoride (F). The oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) level at the end of 2 hr of incubation in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)-Ringer medium was also measured. Both parameters decreased proportionately as F concentration was raised. Both F-induced changes were immediate and were reversed by 10 mM pyruvate. The decrease in NAD(+) concentration following enolase inhibition by F is attributed to a diminished rate of formation in the reaction catalyzed by lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) with undiminished continued utilization in the reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). It is postulated that the NAD(+) lowering limited the GAPDH step, resulting in proportionate decreases in the rates of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and Na,K-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase), a reaction sequence thought to link glycolysis with active Na extrusion. Adding pyruvate with F increased NAD(+) production at the LDH step, thus reactivating GAPDH, PGK, and Na,K-ATPase and leading to the observed restoration of (22)Na release. The results suggest, therefore, that F inhibits active Na transport in intact human erythrocytes indirectly through a lowering of NAD(+), although, direct inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase by F may possibly occur simultaneously.
