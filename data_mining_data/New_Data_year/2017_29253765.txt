This study aims to investigate the utilization of The Warburg Effect, cancer's "sweet tooth" and natural greed for glucose to enhance the effect of monocarboxylate transporter inhibition on cellular acidification. By simulating hyperglycemia with high glucose we may increase the effectiveness of inhibition of lactate and proton export on the dysregulation of cell pH homeostasis causing cell death or disruption of growth in cancer cells. MCT1 and MCT4 expression was determined in MCF7 and K562 cell lines using RT-PCR. Cell viability, growth, intracellular pH and cell cycle analysis was measured in the cell lines grown in 5mM and 25mM glucose containing media in the presence and absence of the MCT1 inhibitor AR-C155858 (1muM) and the NHE1 inhibitor cariporide (10muM). The MCT1 inhibitor, AR-C155858 had minimal effect on the viability, growth and intracellular pH of MCT4 expressing MCF7 cells. AR-C155858 had no effect on the viability of the MCT1 expressing K562 cells, but decreased intracellular pH and cell proliferation, by a glucose-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NHE1 on its own had a no effect on cell growth, but together with AR-C155858 showed an additive effect on inhibition of cell growth. In cancer cells that only express MCT1, increased glucose concentrations in the presence of an MCT1 inhibitor decreased intracellular pH and reduced cell growth by G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Thus we propose a transient hyperglycemic-clamp in combination with proton export inhibitors be evaluated as an adjunct to cancer treatment in clinical studies.
