To determine the variations of growth, some key enzyme activities such as glucose kinase (GK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and isocitrate lyase (ICL) besides metabolite levels of pyruvate and antibiotic production of newly isolated Streptomyces sp. M3004 were grown in culture media which contain 10-20 g/l concentration with either glucose or glycerol as carbon source. Biomass and intracellular glucose and glycerol levels of Streptomyces sp. M3004 showed positive correlation with the concentration of these carbon sources, and these levels were higher in glucose compared with the glycerol-supplemented mediums. GK, G6PDH, and KGDH activities showed marked correlation with the concentration of both glucose and glycerol, and the activity levels were 4.14-, 1.47-, and 1.27-fold higher in glucose than glycerol. A key enzyme of the glyoxalate cycle, ICL activities decreased with increasing glucose concentrations from 10 to 20 g/l, but increased up to 15 g/l of glycerol. The positive correlations were also determined between intracellular glucose and glycerol levels besides pyruvate and protein variations with respect to concentrations of the carbon sources. Antibacterial activities of Streptomyces sp. M3004 reached maximum on the stationary phase, while it did not change significantly with respect to glucose and glycerol.
