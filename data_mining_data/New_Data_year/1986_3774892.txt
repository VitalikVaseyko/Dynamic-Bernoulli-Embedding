A rat liver cytosol was used to study protein synthesis per se and also to study import of proteins into mitochondria since rat liver cytosol represents an environment closer to that of liver mitochondria than the generally used reticulocytes lysates. Two ATP-regenerating systems were compared. The creatine phosphate/creatine kinase yields higher protein synthesis than the phosphoenol pyruvate/pyruvate kinase system. Hemin, necessary to maintain synthesis by reticulocyte lysates, does not affect the rat liver cytosol. The level of protein synthesis obtained with this cell-free system is comparable to other eukaryotic systems described recently and to the expected value for "in vivo" conditions. Isolated mitochondria incorporated, under our standard conditions, newly synthesized proteins linearly up to 30 min, it ceases when a component(s) in the cytosol had been depleted; addition of freshly translated cytosol restores the import. The bulk of imported proteins are retained in mitoplasts or in mitochondria after treatment with trypsin. The cytosol system will be useful to study questions such as regulation of liver mRNA translation and mitochondrial protein turnover.
