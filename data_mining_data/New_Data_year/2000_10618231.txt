Based on the presence and absence of enzyme activities, the biochemical pathways for the fermentation of inulin by Clostridium thermosuccinogenes DSM 5809 are proposed. Activities of nine enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and alcohol dehydrogenase) were measured at four temperatures (37, 47, 58, and 70 degrees C). Each of the enzymes increased 1.5 to 2.0-fold in activity between 37 and 58 degrees C, but only lactate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase increased at a similar rate between 58 and 70 degrees C. No acetate kinase activity was observed at 70 degrees C. Arrhenius energies were calculated for each of these nine enzymes and were in the range of 9.8 to 25.6 kcal/mol. To determine if a relationship existed between product formation and enzyme activity, serum bottle fermentations were completed at the four temperatures. Maximum yields (in moles per mole hexose unit) for succinate (0.23) and acetate (0.79) and for biomass (29.5 g/mol hexose unit) occurred at 58 degrees C, whereas the maximum yields for lactate (0.19) and hydrogen (0.25) and the lowest yields for acetate (0.03) and biomass (19.2 g/mol hexose unit) were observed at 70 degrees C. The ratio of oxidized products to reduced products changed significantly, from 0.52 to 0.65, with an increase in temperature from 58 to 70 degrees C, and there was an unexplained detection of increased reduced products (ethanol, lactate, and hydrogen) with a concomitant decrease in oxidized-product formation at the higher temperature.
