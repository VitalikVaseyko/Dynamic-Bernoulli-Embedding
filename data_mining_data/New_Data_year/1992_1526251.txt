The effects of sodium orthovanadate (0.6 mg/ml in drinking water) on hexokinase isozymes, pyruvate kinase and malic enzyme in liver and kidney of control and alloxan diabetic rats were studied and compared. Vanadate treatment of diabetic rats normalized hyperglycemia and almost completely restored the differentially altered enzyme profile of liver (a tissue that underutilizes glucose in diabetes) and kidney (a tissue that overutilizes glucose during diabetes). Vanadate therapy, however, could not restore the depressed plasma insulin level of diabetic rats. The study clearly indicates that vanadate can effectively normalize many metabolic abnormalities even at a low insulin level in both insulin-dependent and -independent tissues of diabetic rats.
