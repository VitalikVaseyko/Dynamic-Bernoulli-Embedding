Extracts of a wild-type strain of Neurospora crassa, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets, were hybridized to an end-labelled pyruvate kinase (PK) gene fragment containing the 5' noncoding sequence and a large part of the coding region. A 30-kDa protein was found to bind strongly to the PK gene DNA, while binding weakly to plasmid pUC12 DNA and to total N. crassa DNA. Probing of blots with individual restriction fragments derived from the PK gene showed that the protein binding occurred primarily to the 5' noncoding region. Nonspecific DNA from pUC12, PK gene DNA from the recombinant plasmid pNP460 (pUC12 containing a 1.8-kilobase EcoRI insert of the PK gene DNA), along with a 0.7-kilobase EcoRI-AccI restriction fragment containing the 5' flanking region, were used in filter-binding experiments to analyze the kinetics of binding. Formation of protein-DNA complexes was demonstrated by monitoring the electrophoretic mobility of this fragment on nondenaturing gels.
