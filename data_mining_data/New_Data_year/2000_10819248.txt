AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha gene cause the type 1 form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1). The R127W mutation is a missense mutation located in the T-box region of HNF-4alpha that was first identified in a Japanese family with MODY. We have examined the functional properties of this mutation in order to clarify the molecular basis of MODY1. METHODS: The intracellular localisation, DNA binding ability, transactivation activity and functional synergism with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) of R127W-HNF-4alpha were investigated. RESULTS: The nuclear import and functional synergy with CBP of R127W-HNF-4alpha were normal. The DNA binding ability of the mutant was decreased as was its transcriptional activation of the HNF-1alpha and L-type pyruvate kinase (PKL) genes. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The R127W mutation seems to be a loss-of-function mutation.
