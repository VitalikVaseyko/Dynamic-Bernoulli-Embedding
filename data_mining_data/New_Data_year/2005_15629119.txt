It has been proposed that "Glu238" within the N-box of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a base catalyst. The pH dependence of k(cat) of Arabidopsis thaliana PDK indicates that ionizable groups with pK values of 6.2 and 8.4 are necessary for catalysis, and the temperature dependence of these values suggests that the acidic pK is due to a carboxyl- or imidazole-group. The E238 and K241 mutants had elevated K(m,ATP) values. The acidic pK value of the E238A mutant was shifted to 5.5. The H233A, L234H, and L234A mutants had the same pK values as wild-type AtPDK, contrary to the previous proposal of a "Glu-polarizing" His. Instead, we suggest that the conserved Glu, Lys, and Asn residues of the N-box contribute to coordinating Mg2+ in a position critical for formation of the PDK-MgATP-substrate ternary complex.
