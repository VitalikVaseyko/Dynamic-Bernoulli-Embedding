Yellowing of detached mature tobacco leaves standing in water in the dark was accompanied by a strong "climacteric rise" in respiration rate. During this period the ATP level and energy charge of the adenylate system also rose. The levels of glycolytic intermediates between glucose 1-phosphate and triose phosphates rose, those between 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate fell, and pyruvate rose. On the assumption of a drop in NAD/NADH ratio, as found by other workers in wheat leaves, the reverse crossover between triose phosphates and 3-phospholglycerate was attributed to inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The forward crossover between phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate was taken to indicate activation of pyruvate kinase, possibly by fructose diphosphate. Secondary large rises in pyruvate and fructose diphosphate occurred well after the climacteric peak had been passed. No evidence was found for participation of phosphofructokinase in metabolic control in the yellowing leaf. Possible limitations to the use of the crossover theorem in the present situation, such as changes in compartmentation and in flux through branch points, are emphasized.
