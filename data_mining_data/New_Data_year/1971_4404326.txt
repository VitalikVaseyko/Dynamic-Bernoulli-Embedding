The activities of the mouse liver enzymes tryptophan oxygenase, tyrosine aminotransferase, and pyruvate kinase were measured after infection with three dose levels of Salmonella typhimurium strain SR-11. Infection occurred in all groups as evidenced by an increase in bacterial numbers and by death of the animals. The activities of the enzymes increased in all groups during the course of the infection. The results obtained during infection are compared with those obtained after endotoxin injection.
