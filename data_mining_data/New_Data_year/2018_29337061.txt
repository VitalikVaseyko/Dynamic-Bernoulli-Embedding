Keloids, tumor-like fibroproliferative cutaneous lesions, were reported in metabolic disturbance. However, the metabolic character remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine if glycolytic reprogramming is important for the pathogenesis of keloids and to assess the inhibition potential of glycolysis in keloid treatment. An intracellular metabolic profile assay was used to compare metabolic phenotypes between normal skin fibroblasts and keloid fibroblasts (NFs and KFs). Our data indicated that KFs underwent reprogramming of their metabolic phonotype from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) with augmented glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Both gene and protein assays showed that the expression of glycolytic enzymes was upregulated in KFs compared to NFs. Our data showed higher glucose influx and lactate production in KFs compared to NFs. Furthermore, the proliferation of KFs was suppressed in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner after inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG). Taken together, these findings suggested that keloids underwent a reprogrammed metabolic phenotype of aerobic glycolysis. This was essential for keloid hyperplasia, and glycolytic inhibitors might provide a potential treatment for keloids.
