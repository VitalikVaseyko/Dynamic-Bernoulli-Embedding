The measurement of faecal tumour M2 pyruvate kinase (tumour M2 PK) has been proposed as a novel approach for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, as regards the potential of the test to detect precursors to CRC, an issue that is highly relevant to estimate its use in reducing CRC incidence and mortality, the available evidence is scant and controversial. The aim of our study was to determine the performance characteristics of the tumour M2 PK test with respect to colorectal adenomas in the target population of screening. Among 1082 participants of screening colonoscopy in Germany, of whom 30% had any adenoma and 10% had an advanced adenoma, the median (interquartile range) tumour M2 PK level in the whole study population was 1.3 U ml(-1) (0.3-3.3). At a cutoff value of 4 U ml(-1), sensitivity was 22 and 23% for detection of advanced and other adenomas, respectively, whereas specificity was 82%. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (95% confidence interval) was 0.54 (0.51-0.58) and 0.56 (0.52-0.59) for advanced and other adenomas, respectively. In conclusion, the tumour M2 PK test has only very limited potential to distinguish between people bearing precursors to CRC and people with no finding at colonoscopy.
