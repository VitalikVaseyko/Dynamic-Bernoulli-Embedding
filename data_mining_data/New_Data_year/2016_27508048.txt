MiR-338-3p is down-regulated in cancer, which inhibits cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and increases chemosensitivity, but its functions in ovarian cancer remains unknown. The present study aims to identify the miR-338-3p targeted genes and to investigate the associated regulatory mechanisms in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and metabolism. Our results demonstrated miR-338-3p expression was down-regulated in most of ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-338-3p expression in ovarian cancer cells could inhibit cell proliferation, lactate production and lactate production of ovarian cancer cells. PKM2 was verified as a target gene of miR-338-3p by luciferase assay. Further study indicated miR-338-3p controlled ovarian cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting PKM2 expression. It is summarized that the regulatory role of miR-338-3p on PKM2 expression in ovarian cancer may play important roles in cell metabolism.
