The dependence of pyruvate kinase reaction rate on the concentration of one of the ligands--ADP or MgCl2--at constant concentrations of the other ligand was studied. The enzyme activity vs ligand concentration curves have fairly symmetrical peaks which correspond to the range of approximately equal ligand concentrations. The S-shaped dependence is observed only over the range of concentrations close to the dissociation constant for the Mg-ADP- complex (0.7 mM) under the given experimental conditions. The data obtained are consistent with the results of the first model kinetics within the framework of the London-Steck theory. The substrate for pyruvate kinase is the Mg-ADP- complex, while free Mg2+ and ADP3- competitively inhibit the enzyme. The inhibition constants are equal to 44 and 1 mM, respectively. The inhibiting effects of the metal and dinucleotide may be due to the competition with the substrate for the enzyme active site. Taking into consideration the fact that the binding of one of the ligands to the enzyme depends on the presence of the other ligand, a conclusion is drawn that Mg2+ forms a bridge with ADP3- and pyruvate kinase from adrenal cortex.
