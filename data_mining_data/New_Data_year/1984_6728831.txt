The activity of enzymes with a regulatory function in the pathways of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and NADP-generation was investigated in 50 placentae from normal pregnancies and deliveries, 23 placentae from women with gestational diabetes, and 12 placentae from insulin-dependent patients. In placentae from the gestational diabetic group, the activity of pyruvate kinase and of NADPH-generating enzymes was raised and the activity of enzymes connected to glucogenesis was unchanged. These alterations were attributed to the oversupply of glucose and insulin to morphologically normal and well-oxygenated placental tissue. In the placentae from the insulin-dependent group, the activity of pyruvate kinase was reduced, the activity of NADPH-generating enzymes was enhanced and the activity of those related to the gluconeogenesis was unchanged. It is suggested that this pattern of enzyme changes reflects a reduction in the glycolytic capacity in these placentae, which may be due to inhibition by products of enhanced fatty acid oxidation in diabetes, amino acids and/or by long-term anoxia as a result of uteroplacental circulatory disturbances. The possible relation of reduced energy-forming capacity of the placenta in diabetes to its transport function is discussed.
