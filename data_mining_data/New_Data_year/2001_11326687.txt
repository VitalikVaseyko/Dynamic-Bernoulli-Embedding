The pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2-PK is known to be associated with a metabolic shift that is characteristic for tumor cells. Meanwhile, the universal expression of this isoenzyme is the basis for the detection of various tumor diseases in human clinical diagnosis. Other enzymes which are known to be essential for this tumor specific metabolic shift in rat chemical carcinogenesis are the NADP-dependent enzymes malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To evaluate the role of these enzymes in human carcinogenesis, we compared their enzymatic activities in normal colon mucosa and tissues derived from primary colon tumors. Histochemical staining showed that the enzyme activities were restricted to mucosal colon cells and colon cancer cells. The enzymes were strongly but heterogeneously expressed in the tumor tissues, whereas staining of normal mucosa was weak. Tumor M2-PK showed the most prominent differences in normal colon mucosa and colon cancer cells.
