Neurone-specific enolase (NSE) and the brain form of creatine phosphokinase (CPK-BB) were previously found to be present in rat synaptosomal plasma membranes (SPM) using two-dimensional gel (2-D gel) and peptide analysis; enzymatic activities of these and of pyruvate kinase (PK), all involved in ATP generation, were shown to be "cryptic" unless the SPM were treated with Triton X-100. We now show that enzymatic activation also occurs when the SPM are treated with trifluoperazine (TFP). TFP activation occurred even when the enzymes were membrane associated, showing that solubilization was not responsible for "unmasking" the enzyme activities. When TFP treatment was performed at alkaline instead of neutral pH, NSE and CPK-BB were released as well as PK, nonneuronal enolase, and aldolase which were identified by 2-D gel and tryptic peptide analysis. Other proteins released included calmodulin, actin, and the 70-kilodalton heat-shock cognate protein. Tubulin, synapsin I, and a 35-kilodalton basic protein were largely unaffected. The latter was identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the basis of 2-D gel and peptide analyses and subsequent partial sequencing of a rat brain cDNA coding for the same protein. TFP treatment is thus useful for activating latent enzymes as well as for distinguishing enzymes that have a different disposition on the membrane.
