Fluorescent-labeled invertase, a hyperglycosylated mannoprotein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was found to bind to Lactococcus lactis IL1403 at acidic pH. Proteins on the cell wall of the bacterium affinity-purified using invertase as a ligand were identified to be heat shock proteins such as DnaK and GroEL and glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. DnaK bound to both the bacterium and yeast at pH 4 and aggregated them at above 0.1 mg/ml, whereas no significant difference between the circular dichroism spectra of DnaK at pH 4 and 7 was observed. These results indicate that the cytosolic proteins, including DnaK displayed on the cell wall, cause the lactic acid bacterium to adhere to the yeast.
