The M2 isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) is specifically expressed in tumor cells (TuM2-PK) and has been detected in the peripheral blood of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). TuM2-PK is not useful as a biological marker in localized RCC. We analysed TuM2-PK in 68 patients with metastatic RCC after initial surgery and prior to or during chemoimmunotherapy of metastases. In 50 patients, the levels of TuM2-PK were measured during chemoimmunotherapy with interleukin-2, interferon-alpha2a and 5-fluorouracil for up to 8 months and were correlated to response as assessed by radiological imaging techniques. TuM2-PK was quantified with a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit using a cut off of 15 kU/l. In 48 of 68 patients (71%), TuM2-PK was elevated above the cut-off. TuM2-PK was significantly higher in G3 tumors than in G2 tumors. In 34 of 50 patients (68%) undergoing chemoimmunotherapy, a positive correlation between TuM2-PK values and response to treatment was observed. Based on these data, we would not recommend the routine clinical use of TuM2-PK in metastatic RCC at this point.
