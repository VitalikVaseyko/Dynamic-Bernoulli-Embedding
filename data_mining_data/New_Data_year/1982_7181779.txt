Pyruvate kinase deficiency anaemia was suspected in an 18-month-old male Basenji dog after other known causes of canine haemolytic anaemia had been excluded. Anaemia of moderate severity (packed cell volumes 0.20 to 0.26 1/1) and reticulocytosis (uncorrected reticulocyte counts 8 to 43%) persisted during 5 months' observation, and biopsies showed development of bone marrow fibrosis and sclerosis. The diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency anaemia was presumptive because erythrocyte pyruvate kinase concentrations in the affected dog were inconclusive and related animals were not available for enzyme assay. However, the gene for pyruvate kinase deficiency is known to occur among Basenji dogs in Australia.
