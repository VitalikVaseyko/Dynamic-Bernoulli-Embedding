To understand the control mechanisms involved in the regulation of fetal glycogen, we have studied the effect of in utero fetal decapitations on glycogen metabolism in rabbit fetal heart, lung, and liver. In utero fetal decapitations were performed between days 18 and 21 of gestation. Two to four fetuses on one side of the horn were decapitated. Fetuses were delivered between days 23 and 26 or between days 28 and 30 of gestation. Fetal heart, lungs, and liver were analyzed for DNA, protein, glycogen, glycogen synthase (I and D forms), glycogen phosphorylase (a and b forms), phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase. In fetal heart and lung, no difference was observed in any of the above measurements in the intact and decapitated fetuses. In contrast, fetal liver does not appear to develop the glycogen system as indicated by the very low levels of glycogen (0.02 mg/mg DNA) in decapitated fetuses as compared with intact fetuses (0.4 mg/mg DNA). Similarly the levels of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase were two to three times lower in livers from decapitated fetuses as compared with the livers from intact fetuses. The three enzymes phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase were not affected by fetal decapitation in all three tissues. These results indicate that the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (thyroid) axis is not required at least after day 18 of gestation for the normal accumulation and subsequent utilization of glycogen in fetal heart and lungs, while it is an absolute requirement for the development of the fetal liver glycogen system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
