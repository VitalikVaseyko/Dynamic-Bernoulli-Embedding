UNLABELLED: The authors report a case of hydrops fetalis due to severe pyruvate kinase deficiency, the most unusual clinical manifestation of this disease. CONCLUSION: Pyruvate kinase deficiency, as other erythrocyte enzymopathies, must be considered in the differential diagnosis of non-immune hydrops fetalis. This has important implications for clinical investigations, therapy and genetic counselling.
