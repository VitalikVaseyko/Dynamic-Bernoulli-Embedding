Microglia-induced neuroinflammation is an important pathological mechanism influencing various neurodegenerative disorders. Excess activation of microglia produces a myriad of proinflammatory mediators that decimate neurons. Hence, therapeutic strategies aimed to suppress the activation of microglia might lead to advancements in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we synthesized a novel ethyl pyruvate derivative, named EOP (S-ethyl 2-oxopropanethioate) and studied its effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) in rat primary microglia and mouse BV-2 microglia. EOP significantly decreased the production of NO, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase and other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. The phosphorylation levels of extracellular regulated kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB were also inhibited by EOP in LPS-activated BV-2 microglial cells. Overall, our observations indicate that EOP might be a promising therapeutic agent to diminish the development of neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglia activation.
