The activity of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate shunt, as well as of some enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, were determined in the purple sulfur bacterium Chromatium minutissimum, either maintained by subculturing in liquid medium or stored in the lyophilized state for 36 years. In cultures stored in the lyophilized state, the activities of the key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glyoxylate shunt, and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway were higher, whereas the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase were somewhat lower than in cultures maintained by regular transfers.
