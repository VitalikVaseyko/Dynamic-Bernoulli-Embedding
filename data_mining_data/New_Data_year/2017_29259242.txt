Photoreceptor death is the root cause of vision loss in many retinal disorders, and there is an unmet need for neuroprotective modalities to improve photoreceptor survival. The biosynthetic requirement of photoreceptors is among the highest in the body, and to meet this demand, photoreceptors maintain their ability to perform aerobic glycolysis. This highly regulated form of glycolysis allows cells to efficiently budget their metabolic needs and may be a critical link between photoreceptor function and survival. Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) is a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis. In the present study, we characterized the effect of PKM2 deletion on baseline functioning and survival of photoreceptors over time by utilizing a photoreceptor-specific, PKM2 knockout mouse model. We found that upon PKM2 deletion, PKM1 is upregulated in the outer retina and there is increased expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism, which led to chronic degenerative changes in the outer retina of these mice. We also discovered that this metabolic reprogramming provided a survival advantage to photoreceptors in an experimental model of retinal detachment. This study strongly supports the hypothesis that reprogramming metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for photoreceptor neuroprotection during acute stress.
