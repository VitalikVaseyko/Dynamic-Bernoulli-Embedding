Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to chromosome 1q21-24 in multiple samples, including a Utah family sample. Variants in 13 of the numerous candidate genes in the 1q region were tested for association with T2D in a Utah case-control sample. The most promising, 19 variants in 6 candidates, were genotyped on the Utah family sample. Herein, we tested the 19 variants individually and in pairs for an effect on T2D risk in family members using a logistic regression model that accounted for gender, age, and BMI and attributed residual genetic effects to a polygenic component. Seven variants increased risk significantly through 5 pairs of interactions. The significant variant pairs were apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) rs6413453 interacting with calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) rs617698, dual specificity phosphatase 12 (DUSP12) rs1503814, and retinoid X receptor gamma (RXRG) rs10918169, a poly-T insertion-deletion polymorphism in liver pyruvate kinase (PKLR) interacting with APOA2 rs12143180, and DUSP12 rs1027702 interacting with RXRG rs10918169. Genotypes of these 5 variant pairs accounted for 25.8% of the genetic variance in T2D in these pedigrees.
