Lactate, a by-product of glycolysis, is an indicator of poor tissue perfusion and is a useful biomarker with prognostic value in risk-stratifying patients in several diseases. Furthermore, elevated lactate production is observed in tumour glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, and is essential in promoting tumour cell invasion, metastasis, and immune system evasion, promoting resistance to cell death. However, there are no studies of elevated serum lactate in brain tumour patients as a potential biomarker, to our knowledge. The aim of this study is to determine possible correlations between the malignancy of tumours and pre- and intraoperative serum lactate elevation in patients undergoing craniotomy for tumour resection. We provide initial evidence that a rise in serum lactate can be used as a non-invasive biomarker that correlates with brain tumour grade. The results from this study and future prospective studies may allow for determination of tumour progression and response to therapy using serum lactate as a biomarker.
