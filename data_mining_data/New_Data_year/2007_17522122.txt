The present study aimed to determine the thermal response of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis by integrating information from various levels of biological organization including behavior, metabolic adjustments, heat shock protein expression, and protein kinase activity. Behavioral responses were determined by examining the effect of warming on valve closure and opening. Metabolic impacts were assessed by examining the activity of the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK). Molecular responses were addressed through the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and cJun-N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Mussels increased the duration of valve closure by about sixfold when acclimated to 24 degrees C rather than to 17 degrees C. As indicated by the activity of PK, such behavior caused metabolic depression and probably a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Acclimation to temperatures higher than 24 degrees C caused an increase in mortality and induced the expression of Hsp72. Increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNKs indicated activation of MAPK signaling cascades. The potential involvement of MAPKs in the induction of Hsp genes in the tissues of M. galloprovincialis is discussed. In conclusion, it seems that M. galloprovincialis lives close to its acclimation limits and incipient lethal temperature and that a small degree of warming will elicit stress responses at whole organism and molecular levels.
