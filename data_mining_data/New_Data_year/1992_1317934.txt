The effects of two representative sulfonylureas, tolbutamide and glyburide, on pyruvate kinase (PK) flux were examined in fasted rat hepatocytes. PK flux was estimated by trapping 14C from NaH14CO3 in a 2 mM lactate pool, accounting for any incomplete trapping by parallel incubations with L-[1-14C]alanine. Glyburide (20 microM) and tolbutamide (1 mM) decreased glucose formation by 34.9% and 54.8%, respectively, from 2 mM lactate. This decrease in glucose formation was associated with a proportional decrease in pyruvate carboxylase (PCOX) flux (32.7% and 50.5%, respectively). Under these conditions, no net change in PK flux was observed. When hepatocytes were preincubated with lactate and/or sulfonylurea addition for 30 min prior to radiolabeling with NaH14CO3, the metabolic state of the cells changed markedly. Glyburide produced a 34.6% decrease in glucose formation and a 31.3% decrease in PCOX flux, but no change in PK flux. In contrast, tolbutamide decreased glucose formation by 12.5% and increased PK flux by 53.2%, but no change in PCOX flux was observed. Such an increase in PK flux may be linked to tolbutamide-mediated increases in fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16P) via fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26P). These findings demonstrate that tolbutamide and glyburide decrease hepatic glucose production through various alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, depending upon the metabolic state of the cell. In addition, F26P may play a larger role in the hypoglycemic mechanism of action of tolbutamide than glyburide, since pyruvate carboxylase accounted for most of the decrease in glucose formation observed with glyburide and because preincubation with tolbutamide resulted in an activation of PK.
