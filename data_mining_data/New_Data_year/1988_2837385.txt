Of three casein phosphatases isolated from the cytosol of human cord blood erythrocytes two were cobalt-dependent, E2 and E3. In the presence of CoCl2, E2 activity was the most prominent. In addition to casein, E2 dephosphorylated phosvitin and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) with pH optima at 6.8-7.2 for proteins and 9.0 for p-NPP. The native enzyme had a molecular weight of 104,000 daltons after AcA-44 Ultrogel filtration. According to SDS/PAGE it consisted of two subunits, 78,000 and 15,000 daltons. The 104,000-dalton form exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics and had the greatest affinity for casein between protein substrates tested. Ethanol denaturated the enzyme by 80%. Optimal activation of E2 phosphatase was achieved with 5 mmol/l CoCl2 which did not affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme but did affect the rate of 'E-S' complex formation. Inorganic pyrophosphate was not inhibitory for the 104,000-dalton enzyme. Judging by all these properties the natural substrate for E2 casein phosphatase could be P-pyruvate kinase.
