The method of visual quantitative estimation was employed to determine the index of enzymes activity in embryonal cells cultures infected with Rous virus. In early terms (1-7 days after infection) a moderate production of diformazane was noted in the presence of glucoso-6-phosphatiosomerase, phosphoglucomutase, pyruvatoxidase, NAD. H2- and NADP. H-2-diaphorase, other enzymes showing no distinquishable deviations in the activity, as compared with the normal culture. In later terms (13-27 days) during the proliferation of the transformed cells there was found an increased level of the glycolysis enzymes activity, pentose cycle, hydrolysis of ortho-phosphoric acid monoethers and reduced lemon acid cycle and tissue respiration. Cytoplasmatic vacuoles formed in the transformed cells seem to represent hypertrophic lysosomes and phagolysosomes.
