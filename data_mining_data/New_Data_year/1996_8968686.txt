The effects of a novel hypoglycemic agent, calcium(2s)-2-benzyl-3-(cis-hexahydro-2-isoindolinylcarbonyl) propionate dihydrate (KAD-1229), which is a benzyl succinate derivative, on liver metabolism were investigated using isolated hepatocytes from normal rats. In the presence of 10 mM glucose, KAD-1229 increased the L-lactate production (41.1 +/- 0.9 versus 60.9 +/- 2.6 mumol of lactate/g of cells/30 min; P < 0.05) and inhibited gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes (0.94 +/- 0.02 versus 0.70 +/- 0.03 mumol of [2-14C]-pyruvate converted to glucose/g of cells/20 min; P < 0.05). These effects by KAD-1229 were accompanied by an increase in the cellular content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), which is one of the important regulators of hepatic glucose metabolism, in a dose-dependent manner (0.05-2.5 mM). KAD-1229 also stimulated the oxidation of [2-14C]-pyruvate and [6-14C]-glucose in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (+18 and +31%, respectively), indicating that stimulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and/or enhancement of the glycolytic flux rate had occurred. Moreover, KAD-1229 did not modify the activities of 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase or fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, but increased significantly the accumulation of fructose 6-phosphate in hepatocytes. These results suggest that KAD-1229 has extrapancreatic effects on hepatic glucose metabolism, that its actions are mediated through the inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and stimulation of both the 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase reaction and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity by increasing the F-2,6-P2 content in hepatocytes, and that these multiple effects may account in part for the ability of KAD-1229 to reduce blood glucose levels in vivo.
