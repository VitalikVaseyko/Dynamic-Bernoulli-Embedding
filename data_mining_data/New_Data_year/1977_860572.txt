Setaria cervi, the filarial parasite inhabiting the Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis Linn.) contained almost all the enzymes involved in glycogen degradation. Significant activities of glycogen phosphorylase, glucokinase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, FDP-aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were detected in cell-free extracts of whole worms. The presence of PEP-carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase and fumarate reductase revealed the functioning of the PEP-succinate pathway in addition to phosphorylating glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway in the parasite. Excepting fumarate reductase all other enzymes were localized in the particulate-free cytosol fraction, although small amounts of glycogen phosphorylase, aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase were also detected in the mitochondrial fraction.
