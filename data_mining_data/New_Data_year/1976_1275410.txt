In leaf strips and in nuclei isolated from potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTV)-infected tomato, incorporation of [3H]UMP into PSTV is shown to be inhibited by pre-treatment of the leaf-strips with actinomycin D. These results demonstrate that PSTV is synthesized in the cell nucleus and that replication may occur from a DNA template.
