On the basis of enzyme activities detected in extracts of Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 grown in glucose-limited continuous culture, at a slow (0.11 h-1) and a fast (0.52 h-1) dilution rate, a pathway of glucose catabolism to lactate, acetate, succinate, and propionate was constructed. Glucose was catabolized to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) via the Emden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. PEP was converted to either pyruvate (via pyruvate kinase) or oxalacetate (via PEP carboxykinase). Pyruvate was reduced to L-lactate via a NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase or oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and CO2 by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Acetyl-CoA was apparently converted in a single enzymatic step to acetate and CoA, with concomitant formation of 1 molecule of ATP; since acetyl-phosphate was not an intermediate, the enzyme catalyzing this reaction was identified as acetate thiokinase. Oxalacetate was converted to succinate via the activities of malate dehydrogenase, fumarase and a membrane-bound fumarate reductase. Succinate was then excreted or decarboxylated to propionate via a membrane-bound methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Pyruvate kinase was inhibited by Pi and activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. PEP carboxykinase activity was found to be 0.054 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1 at a dilution rate of 0.11 h-1 but could not be detected in extracts of cells grown at a dilution rate of 0.52 h-1. Several potential sites for energy conservation exist in S. ruminantium HD4, including pyruvate kinase, acetate thiokinase, PEP carboxykinase, fumarate reductase, and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Possession of these five sites for energy conservation may explain the high yields reported here (56 to 78 mg of cells [dry weight] mol of glucose-1) for S. ruminantium HD4 grown in glucose-limited continuous culture.
