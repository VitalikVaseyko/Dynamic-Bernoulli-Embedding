An one-step-purification of native pyruvate kinase from human erythrocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography with monoclonal antibodies coupled on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B is described. The recoveries of PK amounted up to 83%, with a 2400 fold purification of PK-R from human stroma free hemolysate.
