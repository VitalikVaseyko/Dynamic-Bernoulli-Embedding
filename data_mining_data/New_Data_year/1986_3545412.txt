Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKase) and pyruvate kinase (PKase) were measured in Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in the presence of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. The PEPCKase activity was highest in ethanol-grown cells. However, high PEPCKase activity was also observed in cells grown in 1% glucose, especially as compared with the activity of sucrose-, maltose-, or galactose-grown cells. Activity was first detected after 12 h when glucose was exhausted from the growth medium. The PKase activity was very high in glucose-grown cells; considerable activity was also present in ethanol- and pyruvate-grown cells. The absolute requirement of respiration for gluconeogenesis was demonstrated by the absence or significantly low levels of PEPCKase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities observed in respiratory deficient mutants, as well as in wild-type S. cerevisiae cells grown in the presence of glucose and antimycin A or chloramphenicol. Obligate glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes were present simultaneously only in stationary phase cells, but not in exponential phase cells; hence futile cycling could not occur in log phase cells regardless of the presence of carbon source in the growth medium.
