Isolated vegetative tumour cells from mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma showed low rates of basal respiration with both low oxygen uptake rates and cytochrome-c oxidase activity. The cells were affected by a marked Crabtree effect and a high rate of lactate production in the presence of 10 mM glucose. The glycolytic capacity of the tumour was also assessed through the measurement of the maximum activities for hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. These activities were similar to the ones found in other fast-growing, undifferentiated tumours. The concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in the tumour was 2,3 nmoles/g fresh tissue wt., a value which is of the same order of magnitude as that found in other types of highly glycolytic cells. It is concluded that the Lewis lung carcinoma follows the same pattern as other undifferentiated tumours with a high capacity for both glucose and amino acid utilization.
