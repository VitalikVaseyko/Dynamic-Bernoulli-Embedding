Cellulase (Avicelase, Cel1) from Streptomyces reticuli efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose (Avicel) to cellobiose. The synthesis of the enzyme was found to be dependent on the presence of insoluble Avicel but not on either soluble hydroxyethylcellulose, cellooligomers, or cellobiose. Glycerol and various metabolizable mono- and disaccharides repress Avicelase synthesis, whereas yeast extract has no inducing or repressing effect. Glucose kinase is not required for the repression effect. In the course of cultivation, S. reticuli secretes significant quantities of acid, predominantly pyruvate and succinate, which reduce the pH to 4 in commonly used media with low buffering capacity. Comparative studies with media with low and high buffering capacities revealed that Avicelase synthesis is strongly repressed at a low pH.
