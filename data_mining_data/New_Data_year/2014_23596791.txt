OBJECTIVE: Based on proteomics technology, Pi-yang deficiency syndrome (PYDS) correlated differential proteins were screened, thus providing powerful experiment reliance for exploring the essence of PYDS. METHODS: Totally 36 SD rats of SPF grade were randomly divided into the normal control group (n = 16) and the PYDS group (n = 20). The PYDS model rats were induced by improper diet, overstrain, and administration of yang impairing bitter cold herbs. The total proteins of the ileum were separated and extracted from rats in the PYDS group and the normal control group. The differential protein dots were identified using Delyder 2D 6.5 image analysis software by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) technology. The finger print map of corresponding peptide qualities was obtained by applying MALDI TOF/TOF. The differential proteins were identified using Mascot search library. RESULTS: Judged by statistics and fuzzy mathematics, Pi-yang deficiency rat model was successfully established. Eight proteins with differential expressions involving cell skeleton, energy metabolism, and signal transduction, and so on were obtained. Of them, there were 4 up-regulated proteins, i.e., desmin, cytokeratin8 (CK8), pyruvate kinase (PK), and ezrin. Four down-regulated proteins were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), cytokeratin19 (CK19), cytokeratin1 (CK1), and actin. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of PYDS might be slowed energy metabolism rate, reduced energy production, changed structure of ileal villin, and weakened absorbing and digestive functions.
