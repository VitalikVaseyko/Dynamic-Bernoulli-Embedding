Novel bisindolyl-cycloalkane indoles resulted from the reaction of aliphatic dialdehydes and indole. As bisindolyl-natural alkaloid compounds have recently been reported as inhibitors of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-pyruvate kinase (PK), we tested our novel compounds as MRSA PK inhibitors and now report first inhibiting activities. We discuss structure-activity relationships of structurally varied compounds. Activity influencing substituents have been characterized and relations to antibacterial activities of the most active compounds have been proved.
