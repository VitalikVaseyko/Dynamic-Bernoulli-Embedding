The influence of the chronic consumption of alcohol on biochemical reactions of thiamine metabolism in the rat brain is investigated. It is shown that the content of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) in the brain tissue does not change at these conditions, though there is an essential decrease in the thiamine-kinase activity. The ability of the isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) to absorb labelled thiamine also decreases under this condition. The specified disturbances are probably the reason for deceleration of exchange of free (uncombined with proteins) thiamine and its phosphates in nervous cells, that results in the observed reduction in activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) due to inactivation by phosphorylation. Thiamine-binding and thiaminetriphosphatase activities of thiamine-binding protein (ThBP) in the structure of synaptic plasma membranes (SPM), isolated from the rat brain in various experimental groups, have been investigated. The increase, with respect to control, in the both enzymes activity in SPM, isolated from the brain of rats with chronic alcoholism has been shown. Kinetic researches testify to an increase of affinity of SPM (ThBP) for thiamine and thiaminetriphosphate in these conditions. When vitamin E was given to animals with a model of chronic alcoholism the normalization of PDC activity in nervous cells was observed, that can testify to the transient character of these changes. Inability of vitamin E to normalize biological activities of ThBP in PMS, that has been analyzed, can testify to more deep disturbances in the structure of SPM or thiamine binding protein in their structure.
