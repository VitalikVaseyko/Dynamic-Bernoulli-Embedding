Statins activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which activates ecto-5'-nucleotidase and phosphorylates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1). Phosphorylated (P-)PDK-1 phosphorylates Akt, which phosphorylates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). We asked if the blockade of adenosine receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), or A(3) receptors) could attenuate the induction of Akt and eNOS by atorvastatin (ATV) and whether ERK1/2 is involved in the ATV regulation of Akt and eNOS. In protocol 1, mice received intraperitoneal ATV, theophylline (TH), ATV + TH, or vehicle. In protocol 2, mice received intraperitoneal injections of ATV, U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), ATV + U0126, or vehicle; 8 h later, hearts were assessed by immunoblot analysis. In protocol 3, mice received intraperitoneal ATV alone or with 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (SPT); 1, 3, and 6 h after injection, hearts were assessed by immunoblot analysis. In protocol 4, mice received intraperitoneal ATV alone or with SPT, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), 1,3,7-trimethyl-8-(3-chlorostyryl)xanthine (CSC), alloxazine, or MRS-1523; 3 h after injection, hearts were assessed by immunoblot analysis. ATV increased P-ERK, P-PDK-1, Ser(473) P-Akt, Thr(308) P-Akt, and P-eNOS levels. TH blocked ATV-induced increases in P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt, Thr(308) P-Akt, and P-eNOS levels without affecting the induction of P-PDK-1 by ATV. U0126 blocked the ATV induction of Ser(473) P-Akt and Thr(308) P-Akt while attenuating the induction of P-eNOS. A detectable increase in P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt and P-eNOS was seen 3 and 6 h after injection but not at 1 h. DPCPX, CSC, and alloxazine partially blocked the ATV induction of P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt, and P-eNOS. In conclusion, blockade of adenosine A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors but not A(3) receptors inhibited the induction of Akt and eNOS by statins. Adenosine was required for ERK1/2 activation by statins, which resulted in Akt and eNOS phosphorylation.
