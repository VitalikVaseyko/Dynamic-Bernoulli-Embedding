The pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) gene of Escherichia coli is transcribed from seven promoters which are coordinately induced 12- to 15-fold by anaerobiosis. The FNR protein plays a major role in the anaerobic control of this system. A mutation in the fnr gene, however, only reduces anaerobic induction fivefold, indicating that FNR is not the only factor involved in the anaerobic activation process (Sawers and Bock, J. Bacteriol. 171:2485-2498, 1989). The residual anaerobic induction could be shown to be imparted by the transcriptional regulator ArcA; an arcA fnr double mutant was incapable of inducing pfl transcription anaerobically. A mutant strain unable to synthesize the membrane-associated histidine kinase (ArcB) that has been proposed to activate ArcA showed the same phenotype as an arcA mutant strain, indicating that a functional ArcB protein is also required for wild-type, anaerobic pfl transcriptional activation. Nuclease S1 analysis revealed that an arcA mutation abolished anaerobic transcription from promoter 7 and reduced expression from promoter 6 but did not affect transcription from promoters 1 to 5. On the other hand, an fnr mutation prevented anaerobic expression from promoters 6 and 7 and reduced transcription from promoters 1 to 5. These data indicate that both ArcA and FNR are essential for anaerobic activation of promoter 7 transcription, which suggests functional interaction between these proteins.
