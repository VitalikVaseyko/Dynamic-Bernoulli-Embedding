1. The administration of cortisol and of other glucocorticoid steroids to starved mice produced an increase in liver glycogen content, an elevation of glycogen-synthetase activity and a predominantly particulate localization of both phosphorylase and glycogen-synthetase enzymes. 2. Three daily doses of actinomycin D caused a marked glycogen depletion, a significant decrease in glycogen-synthetase activity, the solubilization of phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase and the following effects on the activities of various other enzymes: a decrease in UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and phosphoglucomutase, an increase in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and no change in glucose 6-phosphatase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. 3. Glucose ingestion, but not cortisol administration, reversed the effects of actinomycin D on liver glycogen content and on the activities of phosphorylase and glycogen synthetase.
