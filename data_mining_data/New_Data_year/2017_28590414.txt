Mitochondria consume O(2) to produce ATP and are critical for adaption of hypoxia, but the role of mitochondria in HIF-1alpha pathway is as yet unclear. In this study, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) enriched (SK-N-AS) and depleted (rho(0)) cells of neuroblastoma were cultured in a hypoxic chamber to simulate a hypoxic condition and then the major components involved in mitochondrial related pathways, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured. The results showed that hypoxia-stimulated exposure elevated expression of HIF-1alpha, which was additionally influenced by level of generated ROS within the cytosol. Moreover, elevation of HIF-1alpha also resulted in increases of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) in both hypoxic cells. The expression of mitochondrial biogenesis related proteins and metabolic components were noted to increase significantly in hypoxic SK-N-AS cells, indicating that mtDNA was involved in mitochondrial retrograde signaling and metabolic pathways. An analysis of dynamic proteins found elevated levels of HIF-1alpha causing an increased expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) during hypoxia; further, the existence of mtDNA also resulted in higher expression of DRP1 during hypoxia. By using siRNA of HIF-1alpha or DRP1, expression of DRP1 decreased after suppression of HIF-1alpha; moreover, the expression of HIF-1alpha was also affected by the suppression of DRP1. In this study, we demonstrated that mtDNA is a mediator of HIF-1alpha in eliciting metabolic reprogramming, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Identification of a mutual relationship between HIF-1alpha and DRP1 may be a critical tool in the future development of clinical applications.
