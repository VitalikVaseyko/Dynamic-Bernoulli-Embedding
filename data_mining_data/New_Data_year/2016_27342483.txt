OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of PDK1 in T-ALL development through establishing the Notch1-induced T-ALL mouse model by using Mx1-cre; LoxP system to knock-out PDK1. METHODS: Cell cycle and apoptosis of leukemic cells were detected by flow cytometry, and relative expression of tumor-related genes and transcription factors of leukemic cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Notch1-induced T-ALL mouse model with inducible knock-out of PDK1 was established successfully. Compared to T-ALL control mouse model, PDK1 knock-out mice showed a significant longer survival time (P<0.01). There was no difference of cell cycle between control and PDK1 knock-out mice, and the apoptosis rate of leukemic cells in PDK1 knock-out mice was higher than that of control mice (P<0.001). PDK1 knock-out resulted in decreased expression of tumor-related genes and transcription factors, such as c-Myc and NF-kappaB (P<0.01), and increased expression level of P53 (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: PDK1 knock-out can inhibit the development of T-ALL, and its mechanism may be the leukemia progression inhibited by regulating the apoptosis and expression of multiple related genes and transcription factors.
