Candidate biomarker proteins, including chaperonin 10 and pyruvate kinase, previously discovered and identified using mass-tagging reagents with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (DeSouza, L.; et al. J. Proteome Res. 2005, 4, 377-386) have been identified in serum-free media of cultured endometrial cancer (KLE and HEC-1-A) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cells. These and other cancer-associated proteins were released by the cultured cells within 24 h of growth. A total of 203 proteins from the KLE cells, 86 from HEC-1-A, and 161 from HeLa are reported.
