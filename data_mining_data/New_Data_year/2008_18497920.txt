We report fuel generation systems for molecular motors based on pyruvate kinase, or for the first time, mitochondria, implemented within microfluidic devices. Intact organelles acted as bio-nanopower supplies for molecular motors, using isolated mitochondria to convert chemical energy from succinate to ATP, harnessing nature's enzymatic transformation cascades directly. Motors were activated essentially equally by ATP produced by pyruvate kinase, mitochondria, or direct addition of ATP.
