A rapid procedure for red blood cell isolation by centrifugation is proposed, in which 96% of leucocytes are removed. The middle age of the erythrocytes is verified. This procedure applied to erythrocyte rheological studies (by the initial filtration flow rate) confirms the decreased deformability of senescent red blood cells.
