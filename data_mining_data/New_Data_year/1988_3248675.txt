1. Pyruvate kinase isozyme shift in a regenerating rat liver was studied. Rats were subjected to a 70% hepatectomy and the liver homogenate or hepatocyte preparations were obtained from the regenerating liver. 2. Using thin layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, liver homogenates from an intact normal rat appeared to contain the L-type isozyme in the greatest number and M2-type to a lesser extent. 3. The ratio of the M2- to L-type increased in the preparations obtained from the regenerating liver. 4. In the hepatocyte preparations prepared from a regenerating rat liver by the conventional method, a small amount of M2-type isozyme was detected. 5. However, the M2-type isozyme was hardly detected in the highly purified hepatocyte preparations prepared using Percoll. 6. Similar results were obtained by separation of the enzyme by DEAE cellulose column chromatography. 7. These results suggest that there is no pyruvate kinase isozyme shift from L- to M2-type in hepatocytes in the course of regeneration. 8. The increased M2-type isozyme in the regenerating rat liver is considered to originate from nonparenchymal cells.
