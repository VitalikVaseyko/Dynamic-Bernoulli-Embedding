A study has been made of the effects of phytohaemagglutinin on the gene expression of the glycolytic enzymes in cultured human lymphocytes. All the enzymes were found to show an average increase in activity of between 160% and 360% in stimulated cells, but the increases were greater for the enzymes comprising the second half of the pathway. The enzyme activities in stimulated cells, cultured for 72 h, were similar to the activities measured in long-term lymphoid lines. Starch-gel electrophoresis was used to examine the isozyme patterns of the enzymes before and after exposure of the lymphocytes to PHA. Six of the enzymes showed isozyme patterns unchanged by stimulation. Four of the enzymes, aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, enolase and lactate dehydrogenase, showed different isozyme patterns in stimulated cells from those seen in uncultured or unstimulated cells. The electrophoretic results showed a good correlation in isozyme pattern between uncultured lymphocytes and cultured unstimulated lymphocytes, and between PHA-stimulated lymphocytes and long-term lymphoid lines.
