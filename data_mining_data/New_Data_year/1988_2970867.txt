The beneficial effects obtained with dehydroisoandrosterone (DHA) feeding in the treatment of murine systemic lupus erythematosus are similar to those obtained with caloric restriction or with dietary manipulation of essential fatty acid availability. In this study, the fatty acid composition of selected tissues was examined in NZB/W F1 mice fed a diet containing 0.4% DHA. The effect of the DHA diet on liver composition and the activity of key hepatic enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and glucose metabolism was also investigated. The content of the essential fatty acid, arachidonate, was decreased in plasma cholesteryl esters and liver and kidney phospholipids in mice fed the DHA diet, yet no significant decrease in arachidonate content was observed in plasma phospholipid. The most striking change in both plasma and liver phospholipid was an increase in palmitic acid and a decrease in stearic acid, which could result from a decreased ability for fatty acid elongation. The liver mass was dramatically increased in the mice fed DHA, primarily from parenchymal cell hypertrophy, and contained little lipid. Significant changes in the activities of malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, similar to those changes which occur with fasting, were observed during the initial adaptation to the DHA diet. The pyruvate kinase activity remained low, suggesting a decrease in liver glycolysis. These results are consistent with the concept that diets containing DHA result in an altered metabolism with a decreased dependence on carbohydrate metabolism and an increased metabolism of lipids.
