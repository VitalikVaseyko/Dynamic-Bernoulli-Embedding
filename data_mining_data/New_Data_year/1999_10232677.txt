The final control of sodium balance takes place in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) of the nephron, where corticosteroid hormones regulate sodium reabsorption by acting through mineralocorticoid (MR) and/or glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. A clone of principal CCD cells (mpkCCDc14) has been established that is derived from a transgenic mouse (SV40 large T antigen under the control of the SV40 enhancer/L-type pyruvate kinase promoter). Cells grown on filters form polarized monolayers with high electrical transepithelial resistance (R(T) approximately 4700 ohm x cm2) and potential difference (P(D) approximately -50 mV) and have an amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport, as assessed by the short-circuit current method (Isc approximately 11 microA/cm2). Reverse transcription-PCR experiments using rat MR primers, [3H]aldosterone, and [3H]dexamethasone binding and competition studies indicated that the mpkCCDc14 cells exhibit specific MR and GR. Aldosterone increased Isc in a dose- (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) and time-dependent (2 to 72 h) manner, whereas corticosterone only transiently increased Isc (2 to 6 h). Consistent with the expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which metabolizes glucocorticoids to inactive 11-dehydroderivates, carbenoxolone potentiated the corticosterone-stimulated Isc. Aldosterone (5x10(-7) M)-induced Isc (fourfold) was associated with a three- to fivefold increase in alpha-ENaC mRNA (but not in those for beta- or gamma-ENaC) and three- to 10-fold increases in alpha-ENaC protein synthesis. In conclusion, this new immortalized mammalian CCD clonal cell line has retained a high level of epithelial differentiation and sodium transport stimulated by aldosterone and therefore represents a useful mammalian cell system for identifying the genes controlled by aldosterone.
