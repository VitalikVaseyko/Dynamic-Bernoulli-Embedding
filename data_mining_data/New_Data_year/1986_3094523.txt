Rat liver pyruvate kinase is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II at serine and threonine residues in a 3-4 kDa CNBr fragment located near the amino terminus. The two sites of phosphorylation were separated by reverse-phase HPLC of a thermolysin digest. Sequence analysis established the sites of phosphorylation as follows: Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(PO4)-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu-Thr(PO4)-Gln-Glu.
