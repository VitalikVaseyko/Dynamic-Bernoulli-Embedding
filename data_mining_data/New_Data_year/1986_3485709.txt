Supplementation of diets with vitamin E has been shown to enhance immune responses in numerous animal models. However, these experiments have not investigated the dietary requirement of vitamin E for optimal T- and B-lymphocyte mitogen responses and compared this directly with the requirement for growth, maintenance of spleen-body weight ratios, platelet count as well as prevention of myopathy and red blood cell lysis. We have found that male weanling rats maintain normal rate of growth and spleen-body weight ratio when fed purified diets containing 7.5 mg/kg vitamin E. A level of 15 mg/kg was adequate to prevent myopathy, and 50 mg/kg was necessary for the prevention of red blood cell hemolysis. The dietary requirement for optimum T- and B-lymphocyte responses to mitogens was greater than 50 mg/kg and was significantly correlated with plasma vitamin E levels over a range of 0.04-18 micrograms/ml. Thus, the requirement for this index of immune system activity was higher than for the other functional parameters of vitamin E adequacy measured. Therefore, the immune system responds to changes in dietary vitamin E well before there are signs of frank vitamin deficiency.
