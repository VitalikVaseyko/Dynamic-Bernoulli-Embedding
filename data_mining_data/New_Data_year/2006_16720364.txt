Heat induced complications cause an increase in a large number of proteins which play a role in diverse pathways during heat shock. A detailed characterization of these proteins is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in heat stroke. In this report, the proteins present in rat liver were compared at 37 degrees C (control) and at core temperature (Tc) 42 degrees C (heat stress) by 1D PAGE and MALDI/MS/MS. Among proteins identified in the sample after heat stress are dimethyglycine dehydrogenase, transketolase, carboxylic ester hydrolase, pyruvate kinase, L-type pyruvate kinase, arginosuccinate synthetase; fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase and peptidylpropyl isomerase A. These findings show that analysis of large scale proteins by MALDI/MS/MS provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with heat shock. The resolution of proteins examined by 1D-PAGE was less than that obtained with 2D-PAGE. More specifically, 2D-PAGE allows better identification of low molecular weight proteins that can not be resolved by 1D-PAGE.
