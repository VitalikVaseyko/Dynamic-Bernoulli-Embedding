Effect on hepatocarcinogenesis of dietary sorbitan fatty acid ester (SorFAE), which had been known to cause decrease in pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, was studied in rats fed a diet containing 0.06% 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-Me-DAB) for 6 weeks. The incidence of hyperplastic nodules and/or hepatocellular carcinomas in the rats fed the 3'-Me-DAB diet alone was 45.0% at the end of 51 weeks, whereas the incidence in the rats fed 3'-Me-DAB diet followed by 5 or 10% SorFAE or 0.1% phenobarbital (PB) diet were 76.2, 90.5, and 95.0%, respectively. These incidences were significantly higher compared with the group fed 3'-Me-DAB diet alone (P less than .05). No tumors were observed in rats fed 10% SorFAE diet alone. The results show that SorFAE has an enhancing effect on hepatocarcinogenesis, although the effect was weak compared to that of the effective PB dose. The results seem to confirm our assumption that a chemical that causes decrease in PK activity in rat liver might promote hepatocarcinogenesis.
