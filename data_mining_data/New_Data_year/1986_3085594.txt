Total protein content of P-815 mastocytoma cells decreases and then increases in response to initiation of a new growth cycle. As the level increases, the rate of synthesis declines. Both events occur prior to any decrease in the rate of cellular proliferation. These temporal relationships indicate that the rate of protein synthesis reflects the intracellular concentration of protein rather than the cellular growth rate, as has been hypothesized. Pyruvate kinase protein metabolism differs from that of total protein in three ways: (a) accumulation does not stop, (b) the rate of synthesis does not decrease, and (c) only the rate of pyruvate kinase degradation is altered by a factor present in conditioned media. These observations suggest that there are specific mechanisms regulating pyruvate kinase at a post-transcriptional level.
