We have compared 232 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy belonging to three racial groups: caucasoids, negroids, and mongoloids. Clinical evolution, serum creatine-kinase, and pyruvate-kinase levels were analysed in the three groups. The results of this investigation show that the clinical evolution did not differ significantly among these three racial groups. For serum enzyme activities a statistically significant difference was found only for CK between negroids and mongoloids.
