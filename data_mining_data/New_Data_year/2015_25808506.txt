BACKGROUND: Direct antiglobulin test-negative (DAT(-)) autoimmune hemolytic anemia, characterized by hemolysis without detectable immunoglobulin or complement on patient red blood cells (RBCs), poses a diagnostic challenge. To select therapy, classification of the hemolysis as immune- or non-immune-mediated is important. We developed a method using Western immunoblot (WB) to classify DAT(-) patients by measuring and comparing levels of RBC immunoglobulin (Ig)G to normal donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RBC samples from 42 normal donors were made into ghosts and analyzed by WB and densitometry to establish a normal mean relative quantity of IgG (RQIgG) on the RBCs. RQIgG on eight DAT(-) and eluate-negative patients with hemolytic anemia was determined and compared to RQIgG on normal RBCs. RESULTS: RQIgG of 42 normal donors indicated a calculated mean +/- SD of 0.0016 +/- 0.0015 and we used a cutoff of 0.0047, the mean + 2SD. This was compared with a receiver operating curve cutoff of 0.0041 with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Of the eight patients tested, three were classified as non-immune-mediated (one had pyruvate kinase deficiency) and five as immune-mediated. Two of the patients in the latter group underwent splenectomy, followed by remission. CONCLUSION: WB analysis is more sensitive than conventional test tube DAT or elution analysis. Our assay confirms: 1) previous studies showing normal RBCs are sensitized with IgG, perhaps due to natural autoantibody to senescence; 2) that some normal RBCs have increased levels of IgG without signs of disease; and 3) that WB distinguishes between non-immune- and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in DAT(-) patients and may be useful for clinical diagnosis.
