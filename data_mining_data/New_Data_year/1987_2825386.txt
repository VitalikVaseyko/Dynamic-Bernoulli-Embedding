The effect of thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) and thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) on the activity of rat liver pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulatory enzymes (kinase and phosphatase) was studied in experiments with isolated enzyme preparations. It is shown that ThDP caused a pronounced activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (Ka is equal to 65.0 nM). ThTP inhibits phosphatase competitively against the substrate--the phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The both thiamine phosphates inhibit the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity almost similarly in concentrations exceeding 10 microM. The physiological significance of the antagonistic action of ThDP and ThTP on the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase activity is discussed.
