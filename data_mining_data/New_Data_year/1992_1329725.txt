The initial effects of glucagon on glycogen breakdown in isolated hepatocytes were found to be independent of cell volume and, when it occurred, cell shrinkage followed rather than mediated the glycogenolytic effect of glucagon. Similar conclusions could be drawn for the effect of glucagon on glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and for the antagonistic effect of insulin on glucagon action.
