Initial velocity and product inhibition studies of Mn2+-activated and FDP-modified Mg2+-activated pyruvate kinase from Concholepas concholepas, were performed. Evidence is presented to show that the Mn2+-enzyme catalyzes an ordered sequential mechanism, with ADP being the first substrate and pyruvate the last product. The results presented are consistent with a random combination of reactants with the FDP-modified Mg2+-activated enzyme and the formation of the dead-end complexes enzyme ADP-ATP and enzyme-PEP-ATP.
