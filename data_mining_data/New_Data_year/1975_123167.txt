Specific activities of 14 enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and pentose phosphate pathways were determined in extracts of resting spores and vegetative mycelia of Entomophthora pyriformis. All these enzymes were detected in mycelial extracts, whereas only nine were detectable in resting spore extracts. Activities of detectable spore enzymes were much lower than those of the corresponding mycelial enzymes with the exception of triosephosphate dehydrogenase, which had higher activity in spore extracts. The enzyme deficiencies noted point to the inability of either pathway to function in dormant spores.
