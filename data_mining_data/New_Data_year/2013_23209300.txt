Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nuclear deacetylase that modulates lipid metabolism and enhances mitochondrial activity. SIRT1 targets multiple transcription factors and coactivators. Thyroid hormone (T(3)) stimulates the expression of hepatic genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. We reported that T(3) induces genes for carnitine palmitoyltransferase (cpt1a), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (pdk4), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck). SIRT1 increases the expression of these genes via the activation of several factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, estrogen-related receptor alpha, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1alpha). Previously, we reported that PGC-1alpha participates in the T(3) induction of cpt1a and pdk4 in the liver. Given the overlapping targets of T(3) and SIRT1, we investigated whether SIRT1 participated in the T(3) regulation of these genes. Resveratrol is a small phenolic compound whose actions include the activation of SIRT1. Addition of resveratrol increased the T(3) induction of the pdk4 and cpt1a genes in hepatocytes. Furthermore, expression of SIRT1 in hepatocytes mimicked resveratrol in the regulation of gene expression by T(3). The deacetylase activity of SIRT1 was required and PGC-1alpha was deacetylated following addition of T(3). We found that SIRT1 interacted directly with T(3) receptor (TRbeta). Knockdown of SIRT1 decreased the T(3) induction of cpt1a and pdk4 and reduced the T(3) inhibition of sterol response element binding protein (srebp-1c) both in isolated hepatocytes and in rat liver. Our results indicate that SIRT1 contributes to the T(3) regulation of hepatic genes.
