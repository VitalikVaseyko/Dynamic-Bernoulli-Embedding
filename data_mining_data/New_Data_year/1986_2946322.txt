The intracellular distribution of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and the pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type M1 and type M2 within unfertilized hen eggs was studied. Most of glycolytic enzyme activities were found in the yolk fraction; 8-24% of total glycolytic enzyme activities were found in the vitelline membrane fraction. However, the specific activities of these enzymes in the vitelline membrane fraction are 19-72-fold higher (U/mg protein) and 45-178-fold more concentrated (U/g wet weight) than in the yolk fraction. The study of intracellular localization of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes shows that the blastodisc, latebra and vitelline membrane contain only pyruvate kinase type M2, whereas pyruvate kinase types M1 and M2 are found in the egg yolk. The exclusive occurrence of pyruvate kinase type M2 in the blastodisc is consistent with the concept that this isoenzyme is involved in the cell proliferation. The heterogeneous distribution of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the heterogeneous localization of the pyruvate kinase isoenzymes types M1 and M2 indicate that glycolysis is distributed heterogeneously within the unfertilized hen egg cell.
