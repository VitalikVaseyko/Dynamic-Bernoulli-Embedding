A procedure for the determination of picomole amounts of glycerate 3-phosphate, glycerate 2-phosphate, and phosphoenol pyruvate is described. These metabolites were utilized by the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase to generate ATP which was determined by firefly luciferase/luciferin luminescence. The phosphoglycerate mutase used was of the glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate-independent type and was prepared from wheat germ. Stoichiometric conversion of glycerate 3-P, ranging in amount from 9 to 275 pmol, occurred after 25 min preincubation and required a narrow range of added mutase. The application of the procedure for determining these metabolites in suspensions of plant protoplasts is described.
