The dynamic properties of a series of in vitro reaction systems with increasing complexity and containing phosphofructokinase as central enzyme have been investigated. An experimental strategy and a principal mathematical treatment was elaborated to search for the minimum requirements with respect to the enzyme composition of a reaction system for generating limit cycle behaviour. As a criterion, such models have been developed which permit experimental realization by application of a specially designed flow-through equipment. In addition to phosphofructokinase, the following enzymes have been stepwise included into the reaction systems composing the Models 1 through 6: pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, hexokinase, and glucose 6-phosphate isomerase. It turned out that only a minimum dynamic system containing phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase as well as excesses of adenylate kinase and glucose 6-phosphate isomerase for maintaining equilibrium conditions between the respective reacting species, acquires the property of limit cycle behaviour and, hence, to generate sustained self-oscillations. The approach permits to compute the region of the experimentally variable parameters (influx rates of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP, maximum rate of pyruvate kianse) for which self-oscillatory behaviour can be predicted.
