Tissue sections of cortex and outer and inner medulla of rat kidneys were examined in the Warburg apparatus with and without addition of NaF. It was shown that the O2 consumption was not significantly reduced in the presence of 0.05 mM F (=0.95 ppm F!) or smaller amounts. The respiratory quotient was not changed by NaF. Lactate formation in sections from the inner medulla was reduced to the same degree as O2 consumption. Maximal concentrations of plasma fluoride which are met in doses of fluoride used for the prophylaxis of caries, do not impair renal metabolism.
