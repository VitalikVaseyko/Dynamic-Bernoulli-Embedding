Ghosts of human erythrocytes prepared by hypotonic hemolysis were assayed for aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutathione peroxidase and reductase. Cryptic activity of the enzymes was demonstrated by an increase in activity on dilution with water, which caused fragmentation of the ghosts. Aldolase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase were classed as firmly bound; phosphoglycerate kinase was intermediate; the others were loosely bound. Triton X-100 increased the activities of aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase. The pH of the medium had little effect upon the firmly bound enzymes but it markedly affected the retention of hemoglobin and the activities of the loosely bound enzymes. The presence of Mg or Ca ions enhanced the retention of hemoglobin and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, with little effect on aldolase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. Ghosts diluted in water disintegrated into fragments and tubules or vesicles; Mg or Ca at 1MM afforded protection against this. When ghosts were treated with Triton X-100 and adenosine triphosphate, they contracted to about one-seventh of their volume. The shrunken ghosts had lost a considerable proportion of their cholesterol and protein to the medium.
