2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol inhibited glucose synthesis, increased the pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate ratio and altered adenine nucleotide concentrations in hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats. The accumulations of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-diphosphate, an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase, and of ADP in treated hepatocytes can account for the increase in pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate ratio and the inhibition of glucose synthesis from lactate.
