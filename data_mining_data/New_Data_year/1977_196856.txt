Reaction of ADP with hexamethylene diisocyanate in hexamethylphosphoramide followed by treatment in an acidic medium afforded three new adenine nucleotide analogues, N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-ADP, N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-ATP, and N6-[N-(6-aminohexyl)carbamoyl]-AMP in yields of 13%, 12% and 17%, respectively. The occurrence of the ATP analogue may be interpreted in terms of the equilibrium, 2ADP = ATP + AMP. Coenzymic activities of the ADP analogue against acetate kinase and pyruvate kinase were 82% and 20%, respectively, relative to ADP and those of the ATP analogue against hexokinase and glycerokinase were 63% and 87%, respectively, relative to ATP. These analogues were bound to CNBr-activated soluble dextran through their terminal amino group to give an immobilized ADP and an immobilized ATP, each of which was recycled in a system comprising acetate kinase and hexokinase, and when placed in a membrane reactor together with the enzymes, functioned as an immobilized coenzyme continuously yielding glucose 6-phosphate. A series of chemically defined affinity adsorbents were obtained by coupling these analogues to CNBr-activated Sepharose, and were used to separate the enzymes in a mixture of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase.
