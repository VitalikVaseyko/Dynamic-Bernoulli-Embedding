This review summarizes the recent developments on the regulation of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by site-specific phosphorylation by four kinases. Mutagenic analysis of the three phosphorylation sites of human pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) showed the site-independent mechanism of phosphorylation as well as site-independent dephosphorylation of the three phosphorylation sites and the importance of each phosphorylation site for the inactivation of E1. Both the negative charge and size of the group introduced at site 1 were involved in human E1 inactivation. Mechanism of inactivation of E1 was suggested to be site-specific. Phosphorylation of site 1 affected E1 interaction with the lipoyl domain of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, whereas phosphorylation site 3 appeared to be closer to the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-binding region affecting coenzyme interaction with human E1. Four isoenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) showed different specificity for the three phosphorylation sites of E1. All four PDKs phosphorylated sites 1 and 2 in PDC with different rates, and only PDK1 phosphorylated site 3. PDK2 was maximally stimulated by the reduction/acetylation of the lipoyl groups of E2. Presence of the multiple phosphorylation sites and isoenzymes of PDK is important for the tissue-specific regulation of PDC under different physiological conditions.
