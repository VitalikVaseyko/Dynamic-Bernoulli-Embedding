The effect of nitrate incubation on the pattern of carbohydrate metabolism in different regions of the pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Kelvedon Wonder) root has been studied. Roots were incubated in a 10 mM potassium nitrate solution for 4, 8 and 12 h. Marked increases were noted in the activities of nitrate assimilation enzymes after 4 h. Increased activities were also recorded for hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and transketolase. No consistent changes were observed in the activities of phosphofructokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Experiments with [1-(14)C] and [6-(14)C]glucose indicated a relative shift in the pattern of carbohydrate oxidation from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway. The data are interpreted as indicating a close interrelationship between nitrate assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in relation to the supply of NADPH by the pentose phosphate pathway for nitrite reductase.
