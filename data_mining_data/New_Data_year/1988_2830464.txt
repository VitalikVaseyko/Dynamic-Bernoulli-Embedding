Several ack::Mu d1-8 insertions were isolated from Salmonella typhimurium on MacConkey-glucose-trimethylamine oxide medium. They could not produce gas from glucose in the absence of exogenous formate. Two of the mutants expressed beta-galactosidase activity and were shown to be ack::Mu d1-8 fusions by genetic analysis. These insertions were characterized and located on the genetic map at the ack locus by co-transduction with zei::Tn10. The gene order zei::Tn10-ack-pta was established. The direction of transcription of ack was clockwise on the genetic map. Expression of the lac operon in ack::Mu d1-8 was increased twofold by anaerobiosis. Addition of formate, pyruvate, and acetate did not affect the anaerobic expression of the lac operon in ack::Mu d1-8.
