DNA extracted from 25 hamster-sheep hybrid cell lines was subjected, after Southern blotting, to hybridization with CASB, CASK, LALBA, IGF-1 and AMH cDNA probes. CASB and CASK segregated together and IGF-1 and LALBA were found syntenic with the LDHB-PEPB-TPI-GAPD-SHMT-KRTB group. No other synteny was observed with any of the previously described groups using the same hybrid cell panel.
