Treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) focuses on the underlying metabolic syndrome, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) remains one of the most effective options. In rodents and human patients, RYGB induces an increase in the gene and protein expression levels of the M2 isoenzyme of Pyruvate Kinase (PKM2) in the jejunum. Since PKM2 can be secreted in the circulation, our hypothesis was that the circulating levels of PKM2 increase after RYGB. Our data, however, revealed an unexpected finding and a potential new role of PKM2 for the natural history of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, RYGB-treated patients had decreased PKM2 blood levels compared to a well-matched group of patients with severe obesity prior to RYGB. Interestingly, PKM2 serum concentration correlated with BMI before but not after the surgery. This prompted us to evaluate other potential mechanisms and sites of PKM2 regulation by the metabolic syndrome and RYGB. We found that in patients with NAFLD and NASH, the liver had increased PKM2 expression levels, and the enzyme appears to be specifically localized in Kupffer cells. The study of murine models of metabolic syndrome and NASH replicated this pattern of expression, further suggesting a metabolic link between hepatic PKM2 and NAFLD. Therefore, we conclude that PKM2 serum and hepatic levels increase in both metabolic syndrome and NAFLD and decrease after RYGB. Thus, PKM2 may represent a new target for monitoring and treatment of NAFLD.
