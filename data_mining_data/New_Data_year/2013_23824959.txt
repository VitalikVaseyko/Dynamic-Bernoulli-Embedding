Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenolic compound suggested to have anti-diabetic properties. Surprisingly, little is known regarding the effects of RSV supplementation on adipose tissue (AT) metabolism in vivo. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of RSV on mitochondrial content and respiration, glyceroneogenesis (GNG), and adiponectin secretion in adipose tissue from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Five-week-old ZDF rats were fed a chow diet with (ZDF RSV) or without (ZDF chow) RSV (200 mg/kg body wt) for 6 wk. Changes in adipose tissue metabolism were assessed in subcutaneous (scAT) and intra-abdominal [retroperitoneal (rpWAT), epididymal (eWAT)] adipose tissue depots. ZDF RSV rats showed lower fasting glucose and higher circulating adiponectin, as well as lower glucose area under the curve during intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests than ZDF chow. [(1)(4)C]pyruvate incorporation into triglycerides and adiponectin secretion were higher in scAT from ZDF RSV rats, concurrent with increases in adipose tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase-E1alpha (PDH) (Ser293) protein content in this depot. Moreover, uncoupled mitochondrial respiration and complex I and II-supported respiration were increased in both scAT and rpWAT, which correlated with increases in cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX4) protein content. In vitro treatment of scAT with RSV (50 mumol/l; 24 h) induced pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RSV can induce adipose tissue mitochondrial biogenesis in parallel with increases in GNG and adiponectin secretion.
