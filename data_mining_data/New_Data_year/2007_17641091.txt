Boar spermatozoa contain a novel pyruvate kinase (PK-S) that is tightly bound at the acrosome of the sperm head and at the fibrous sheath in the principal piece of the flagellum, while the midpiece contains a soluble pyruvate kinase (PK). PK-S could not be solubilized by detergents, but by trypsin with no loss of activity. Purified PK-S as well as PK-S still bound to cell structures and soluble sperm PK have all kinetics similar to those of rabbit muscle PK-M1. The PK-S subunit had a relative molecular mass of 64 +/- 1 x 10(3) (n = 3), i.e. slightly higher than that of PK-M1, and carried an N-terminal extension (NH(2)-TSEAM-COOH) that is lacking in native PK-M1. Evidence is provided that PK-S is encoded by the PKM gene. Antibodies produced against the N-terminus of purified PK-S (NH(2)-TSEAMPKAHMDAG-COOH) were specific for PK-S as they did not react with somatic PKs or soluble sperm PK, while anti-PK-M1 recognized both sperm PKs. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed anti-PK-S to label the acrosome and the flagellar principal piece, whereas the midpiece containing the mitochondria was labelled only by anti-PK-M1. Immunogold labelling confirmed the localization of PK-S at the acrosome. In the principal piece, both polyclonal anti-PK-M1 and anti-PK-S were found at the fibrous sheath. Our results suggest that PK-S is a major component in the structural organization of glycolysis in boar spermatozoa.
