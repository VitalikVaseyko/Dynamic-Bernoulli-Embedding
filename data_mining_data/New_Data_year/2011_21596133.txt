Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family have been implicated in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility. Many of these processes are energy demanding. How PKCs affect mitochondrial function to regulate energy production is not well defined. Using an inhibitor Go6983 with broad specificity, we found that inhibiting PKCs reduced mitochondrial mass and altered mitochondrial function characterized by elevations in mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. These alterations indicated that Go6983 suppressed the activities of mitochondrial regulators such as estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha). Indeed, Go6983 dose-dependently suppressed the expression levels of ERRalpha-target genes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). Conversely, PKC activator phorbol ester (PMA) enhanced the expression level of another ERRalpha-target gene pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). This PMA-mediated induction of PDK4 was blunted by an ERRalpha inverse agonist XCT-790, suggesting that ERRalpha plays a role in mediating the effects of PKCs on mitochondrial function. By over-expressing constitutively active forms of PKCs, we found that PKCepsilon preferentially stimulated the transcription activity of ERRalpha. Through mutating residues on ERRalpha, we established that this PKCepsilon-induced ERRalpha activity involves threonine 106, serine 110, and threonine 124 of ERRalpha. Collectively, these pieces of evidence suggest that ERRalpha plays an important role down-stream of PKCepsilon to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis.
