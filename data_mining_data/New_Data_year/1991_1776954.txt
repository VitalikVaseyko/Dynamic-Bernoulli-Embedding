The effect of estradiol-17 beta on the activity of pyruvate kinase from rat brain was investigated at initial stages of hormone administration. After estradiol treatment the rise of pyruvate kinase activity was found in the firmly bound synaptosomal fraction, whereas pyruvate kinase activity in soluble and weakly bound fractions has been reduced. The activation of the enzyme was also discovered after glutaraldehyde fixation on synaptosomal membranes. The possible mechanism of extragenomic estradiol action is discussed.
