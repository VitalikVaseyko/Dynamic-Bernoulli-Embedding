BACKGROUND: Lafora disease (LD, OMIM 254780) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder produced mainly by mutations in two genes: EPM2A, encoding the dual specificity phosphatase laforin, and EPM2B, encoding the E3-ubiquitin ligase malin. Although it is known that laforin and malin may form a functional complex, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this pathology are still far from being understood. METHODS: In order to gain information about the substrates of the laforin/malin complex, we have carried out a yeast substrate-trapping screening, originally designed to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatases. RESULTS: Our results identify the two muscular isoforms of pyruvate kinase (PKM1 and PKM2) as novel interaction partners of laforin. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence indicating that the laforin/malin complex is able to interact with and ubiquitinate both PKM1 and PKM2. This post-translational modification, although it does not affect the catalytic activity of PKM1, it impairs the nuclear localization of PKM2.
