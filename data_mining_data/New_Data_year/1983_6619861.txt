Biopsies from 15 human gliomas, five meningiomas, four Schwannomas, one medulloblastoma, and four normal brain areas were analyzed for 12 enzymes of energy metabolism and 12 related metabolites and cofactors. Samples, 0.01-0.25 microgram dry weight, were dissected from freeze-dried microtome sections to permit all the assays on a given specimen to be made, as far as possible, on nonnecrotic pure tumor tissue from the same region. Great diversity was found with regard to both enzyme activities and metabolite levels among individual tumors, but the following generalities can be made. Activities of hexokinase, phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase levels were usually lower than in brain; glycogen synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were usually higher; and the averages for pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and beta-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase were not greatly different from brain. Levels of eight of the 12 enzymes were distinctly lower among the Schwannomas than in the other two groups. Average levels of glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, pyruvate, and uridine diphosphoglucose were more than twice those of brain; 6-phosphogluconate and citrate were about 70% higher than in brain; glucose, glycogen, glycerol-1-phosphate, and malate averages ranged from 104% to 127% of brain; and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and glucose-1,6-bisphosphate levels were on the average 50% and 70% those of brain, respectively.
