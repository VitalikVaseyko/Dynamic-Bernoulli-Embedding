High-grade gliomas are aggressive and intensely glycolytic tumors. In the present study, we evaluated the mitochondrial respiratory function of glioma cells (T98G and U-87MG) and fresh human glioblastoma (GBM) tissue. To this end, measurements of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were performed under various experimental conditions. The OCR of T98G and U-87MG cells was well coupled to ADP phosphorylation based on the ratio of ATP produced per oxygen consumed of ~2.5. In agreement, the basal OCR of GBM tissue was also partially associated with ADP phosphorylation. The basal respiration of intact T98G and U-87MG cells was not limited by the supply of endogenous substrates, as indicated by the increased OCR in response to a protonophore. These cells also displayed a high affinity for oxygen, as evidenced by the values of the partial pressure of oxygen when respiration is half maximal (p 50). In permeabilized glioma cells, ADP-stimulated OCR was only approximately 50% of that obtained in the presence of protonophore, revealing a significant limitation in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) relative to the activity of the electron transport system (ETS). This characteristic was maintained when the cells were grown under low glucose conditions. Flux control coefficient analyses demonstrated that the impaired OXPHOS was associated with the function of both mitochondrial ATP synthase and the adenine nucleotide translocator, but not the phosphate carrier. Altogether, these data indicate that the availability and metabolism of respiratory substrates and mitochondrial ETS are preserved in T98G and U-87MG glioma cells even though these cells possess a relatively restrained OXPHOS capability.
