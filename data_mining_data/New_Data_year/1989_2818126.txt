Cell-free extracts of two strictly anaerobic mollicutes, Anaeroplasma intermedium 5LA and Asteroleplasma anaerobium 161T, were tested for enzymic activities of intracellular carbohydrate metabolism. Asteroleplasma anaerobium was also tested for enzymes of purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Both organisms had enzymic activities associated with the nonoxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway, and with the Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas pathway. The 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) of Asteroleplasma anaerobium was ATP-dependent, whereas the PFK of Anaeroplasma intermedium was PPi-dependent. The two anaerobic mollicutes also differed with respect to the enzymes that converted phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate; Anaeroplasma intermedium had pyruvate kinase activity, but Asteroleplasma anaerobium had pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase activity (PPi-dependent). Both organisms had lactate dehydrogenase activity which was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2). Anaeroplasma intermedium had activity for PEP carboxykinase (activated by Fru-1,6-P2), but Asteroleplasma anaerobium did not. PEP carboxytransphosphorylase activity was not detected in either organism. Anaeroplasma intermedium had malate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities, but it had no activities for the three other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes examined; Asteroleplasma anaerobium had malate dehydrogenase activity only. Asteroleplasma anaerobium had enzymic activities for the interconversion of purine nucleobases, (deoxy)ribonucleosides, and (deoxy)ribomononucleotides, including PPi-dependent nucleoside kinase, reported heretofore only in some other mollicutes. Asteroleplasma anaerobium could synthesize dTDP by the thymine salvage pathway if deoxyribose 1-phosphate was provided, and it had dUTPase, ATPase, and dCMP kinase activities. It lacked (deoxy)cytidine deaminase, dCMP deaminase, and deoxycytidine kinase activities.
