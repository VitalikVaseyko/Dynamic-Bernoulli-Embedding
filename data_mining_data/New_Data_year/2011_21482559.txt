Being gated by high-energy nucleotides, cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels are exquisitely sensitive to changes in cellular energy metabolism. An emerging view is that proteins associated with the K(ATP) channel provide an additional layer of regulation. Using putative sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) coiled-coil domains as baits in a 2-hybrid screen against a rat cardiac cDNA library, we identified glycolytic enzymes (GAPDH and aldolase A) as putative interacting proteins. Interaction between aldolase and SUR was confirmed using GST pulldown assays and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Mass spectrometry of proteins from K(ATP) channel immunoprecipitates of rat cardiac membranes identified glycolysis as the most enriched biological process. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed interaction for several glycolytic enzymes throughout the glycolytic pathway. Immunocytochemistry colocalized many of these enzymes with K(ATP) channel subunits in rat cardiac myocytes. The catalytic activities of aldolase and pyruvate kinase functionally modulate K(ATP) channels in patch-clamp experiments, whereas D-glucose was without effect. Overall, our data demonstrate close physical association and functional interaction of the glycolytic process (particularly the distal ATP-generating steps) with cardiac K(ATP) channels.
