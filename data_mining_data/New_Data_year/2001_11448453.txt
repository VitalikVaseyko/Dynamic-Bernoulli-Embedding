The short-term effect of metformin on fatty acid and glucose metabolism was studied in freshly incubated hepatocytes from 24-hr starved rats. Metformin (5 or 50 mM) had no effect on oleate or octanoate oxidation rates (CO(2)+ acid-soluble products), whatever the concentration used. Similarly, metformin had no effect on oleate esterification (triglycerides and phospholipid synthesis) regardless of whether the hepatocytes were isolated from starved (low esterification rates) or fed rats (high esterification rates). In contrast, metformin markedly reduced the rates of glucose production from lactate/pyruvate, alanine, dihydroxyacetone, and galactose. Using crossover plot experiments, it was shown that the main effect of metformin on hepatic gluconeogenesis was located upstream of the formation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Increasing the time of exposure to metformin (24 hr instead of 1 hr) led to significant changes in the expression of genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Indeed, when hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of 50 to 500 microM metformin, the expression of genes encoding regulatory proteins of fatty acid oxidation (carnitine palmitoyltransferase I), ketogenesis (mitochondrial hydroxymethylgltaryl-CoA synthase), and gluconeogenesis (glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) was decreased by 30 to 60%, whereas expression of genes encoding regulatory proteins involved in glycolysis (glucokinase and liver-type pyruvate kinase) was increased by 250%. In conclusion, this work suggests that metformin could reduce hepatic glucose production through short-term (metabolic) and long-term (genic) effects.
