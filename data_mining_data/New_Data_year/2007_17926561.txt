The system of extracellular proteolysing, consists of plasminogen (PGn), its active protease (plasmin), PGn activation and PGn activators inhibitors, influences the nervous tissue functions, their growth, differentiation and proliferation in both, normal and pathological conditions. The purpose of the investigation was to study the effects of exogenous PGn, its activator streptokinase (SK), PK and their equimolar complex on the morpho-functional state neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells. PGn, SK, PK and their complexes stimulated cells proliferation during 1-3 days of incubation, shown by cell quantity increase. We also observed DNA, RNA and protein increase. The low lactate dehydrogenase efflux was evidence of that an addition of the proteins under investigation in the culture medium prevented the development of degenerative alterations connected with serum deprivation. The levels of extracellular PGn-activator activity, as measured by the biochemical fibrinolytic assay, increased over SK. This SK effect vanished on the 3rd day when SK formed complexes with PK. New original facts obtained testify the probability of initiation of neoplastic transformation and tumor growth potentiation.
