Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive disease and poses a high risk of severe liver damage. However, the pathogenesis of NASH is still unclear. Accumulation of lipid droplets and insulin resistance is the hallmark of NASH. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 4 (PDK4) plays key role in glucose metabolism via regulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Here, we demonstrated a novel of PDK4 in NASH by regulating hepatic steatosis and insulin signaling pathway in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH model. Hepatic PDK4 levels were highly induced in human patients with NASH and MCD diet fed mice, as well as in hepatocytes treated with oleic acid. The glucose and lipid metabolism were impaired in Pdk4(-/-) mice. Pdk4 deficiency ameliorated the hepatic steatosis significantly in NASH mice. Pdk4(-/-)-MCD mice had reduced liver weights and triglyceride (TG) levels. And Pdk4 deficiency dramatically reduced the expression of genes related to fatty acid uptake, synthesis and gluconeogenesis. In addition, elevated phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), p-SAPK/JNK and diminished p-ERK, p-P38, p-Akt and p-mTOR/p-4EBP1 proteins were observed. In conclusion, our data indicated that PDK4 potentially contributes to the hepatic steatosis in NASH via regulating several signaling pathway and PDK4 may be a new therapeutic strategy against NAFLD.
