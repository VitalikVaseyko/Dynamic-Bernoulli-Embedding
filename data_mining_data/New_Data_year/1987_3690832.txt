An enzymatic assay for creatine, depending on the creatine kinase reaction, has been modified for the determination of creatine in packed erythrocytes, using a centrifugal analyzer (COBAS BIO). The method is precise, sensitive and shows excellent accuracy in recovery experiments when compared to the diacetyl-alpha-naphthol method. The enzymatic red cell creatine correlates with the erythrocyte survival time determined with the radioactive chromium method. It can be used as a rapidly available parameter for the quantification of hemolytic processes.
