Hematological data and the activities of 21 red cell enzymes were measured in 8 nonpregnant ewes, 13 chronically catheterized fetuses at 125-135 days of gestation, and 8 of their mothers. In addition, 7 lambs were followed from birth to 17 days of age. Fetal sheep red cells have dramatically increased activities for 17 of 21 enzymes measured compared with adult nonpregnant ewes. The pattern of decline of enzyme activities with development varies considerably among enzymes. The activity of seven enzymes showed an orderly decline from fetal to adult life. For seven enzymes very little or no decline in activity was observed between 125 and 135 days of gestation and birth. Pyruvate kinase activity declined to adult levels by birth. Phosphoglucose isomerase and nucleoside phosphorylase activity increased, and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased in newborn lamb red cells compared to fetal cells. Differences in blood cell variables were also found among these groups.
