This paper describes the isozyme composition and regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase (PK) from well-differentiated (DMTC) and undifferentiated (AMTC) medullary thyroid carcinomas of the rat. These tumors were chosen as an animal model for human (neuro-)entodermal neoplasms differing in their degree of differentiation. The results were compared with human medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) and phaeochromocytomas. AMTC were characterized by increased PK activity, a higher apparent S0.5 for phosphoenolpyruvate, enhanced inhibition by alanine, presence of predominantly M2-type isozyme and loss of M1-type-containing hybrids as compared to DMTC. The alterations in PK isozyme expression and hence kinetic behaviour could not be demonstrated in human MTC or phaeochromocytomas due to the apparently well-differentiated nature of these tumors and the presence of M2-type isozymes. These results are discussed with reference to the nature and significance of PK isozyme shifts found in other tumors. It is suggested that the determination of PK isozyme composition might prove useful in the diagnosis of nueroectodermal neoplasms originating from tissues not primarily expressing M2-type isozyme(s).
