BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by Brucella infection. In the late fifties, Brucella suis vaccine strain S2 with reduced virulence was obtained by serial transfer of a virulent B. suis biovar 1 strain in China. It has been widely used for vaccination in China since 1971. Until now, the mechanisms underlie virulence attenuation of S2 are still unknown. RESULTS: In this paper, the whole genome sequencing of S2 was carried out by Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing method. We further performed the comparative genomic analysis to find out the differences between S2 and the virulent Brucella suis strain 1330. We found premature stops in outer membrane autotransporter omaA and eryD genes. Single mutations were found in phosphatidylcholine synthase, phosphorglucosamine mutase, pyruvate kinase and FliF, which have been reported to be related to the virulence of Brucella or other bacteria. Of the other different proteins between S2 and 1330, such as Omp2b, periplasmic sugar-binding protein, and oligopeptide ABC transporter, no definitive implications related to bacterial virulence were found, which await further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here provided the rational basis for designing Brucella vaccines that could be used in other strains.
