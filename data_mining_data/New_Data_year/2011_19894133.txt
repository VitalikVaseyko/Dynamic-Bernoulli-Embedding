The effect of dietary carbohydrate complexity on growth, feed utilization and activity of selected key liver enzymes of intermediary metabolism were studied in gilthead sea bream juveniles. Four isonitrogenous (50% crude protein) and isolipidic (16% crude lipids) diets were formulated to contain 20% of pregelatinized maize starch, dextrin, maltose or glucose. Triplicate groups of fish (117 g initial weight) were fed each diet to near satiation during 6 weeks. No effect of dietary carbohydrate on growth was noticed. Feed efficiency was lower in fish fed the glucose diet than the maltose and dextrin diets. The lowest protein efficiency ratio was observed in fish fed the glucose diet. Six hours after feeding, glycemia was higher in fish fed the glucose diet than the maltose and starch diets. Liver glycogen content was unaffected by dietary carbohydrate complexity. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) activity was higher in fish fed the glucose and the maltose diets, while higher pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was recorded in fish fed the glucose diet than in fish fed the starch diet. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities were higher in fish fed the starch diet compared to dextrin and glucose diets. Data suggest that dietary glucose and maltose are more effective than complex carbohydrates in enhancing liver glycolytic activity. Dietary glucose also seems to be more effective than starch in depressing liver gluconeogenic and lipogenic activities. Overall, dietary maltose, dextrin or starch was better utilized than glucose as energy source by gilthead sea bream juveniles.
