The objective of this research was to study the potential function of protein kinase C (PKC)-iota in cell cycle progression and proliferation in glioblastoma. PKC-iota is highly overexpressed in human glioma and benign and malignant meningioma; however, little is understood about its role in regulating cell proliferation of glioblastoma. Several upstream molecular aberrations and/or loss of PTEN have been implicated to constitutively activate the phosphatidylinositol (PI) (3)-kinase pathway. PKC-iota is a targeted mediator in the PI (3)-kinase signal transduction repertoire. Results showed that PKC-iota was highly activated and overexpressed in glioma cells. PKC-iota directly associated and phosphorylated Cdk7 at T170 in a cell cycle-dependent manner, phosphorylating its downstream target, cdk2 at T160. Cdk2 has a major role in inducing G(1)-S phase progression of cells. Purified PKC-iota phosphorylated both endogenous and exogenous Cdk7. PKC-iota downregulation reduced Cdk7 and cdk2 phosphorylation following PI (3)-kinase inhibition, phosphotidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 knockdown as well as PKC-iota silencing (by siRNA treatment). It also diminished cdk2 activity. PKC-iota knockdown inhibited overall proliferation rates and induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These findings suggest that glioma cells may be proliferating through a novel PI (3)-kinase-/PKC-iota/Cdk7/cdk2-mediated pathway.
