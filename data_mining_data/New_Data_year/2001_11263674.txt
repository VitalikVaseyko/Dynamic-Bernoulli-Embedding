The influence of the hypoglycemic agent glipizide (0-100 microM) on the rate of gluconeogenesis from lactate, as well as on the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, has been investigated in hepatocytes isolated from genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats and from their corresponding lean (Fa/-) littermates. As compared to lean rat hepatocytes, liver cells isolated from obese animals showed a lower rate of basal gluconeogenesis (0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 5.4 +/- 0.5 micromol of lactate converted to glucose/g cell x 30 min, n=4) and higher levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (11.5 +/- 1.0 vs 5.9 +/- 0.4 nmol/g cell, n=8-9). In lean rat hepatocytes, the presence of glipizide in the incubation medium caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the rate of lactate conversion to glucose (maximal inhibition=46%; EC50 value=26 microM), and simultaneously raised the cellular content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (maximal increment=40%; EC50 value=10 microM). In contrast, in hepatocytes isolated from obese rats, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis and the increment in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels elicited by glipizide were significantly reduced (maximal effects of 22 and 13%, respectively). Similarly, the activation of glycogen phosphorylase and the increase in hexose 6-phosphate levels in response to glipizide were less marked in obese rat hepatocytes than in liver cells isolated from lean animals. These results demonstrate that the efficacy of sulfonylureas as inhibitors of hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced in the genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rat.
