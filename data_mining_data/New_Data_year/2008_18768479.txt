Reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates numerous aspects of cell function, and abnormal phosphorylation is causal in many diseases. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is central to the regulation of glucose homeostasis. PDC exists in a dynamic equilibrium between de-phospho-(active) and phosphorylated (inactive) forms controlled by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDP1,2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4). In contrast to the reciprocal regulation of the phospho-/de-phospho cycle of PDC and at the level of expression of the isoforms of PDK and PDP regulated by hormones and diet, there is scant evidence for regulatory factors acting in vivo as reciprocal "on-off" switches. Here we show that the putative insulin mediator inositol phosphoglycan P-type (IPG-P) has a sigmoidal inhibitory action on PDK in addition to its known linear stimulation of PDP. Thus, at critical levels of IPG-P, this sigmoidal/linear model markedly enhances the switchover from the inactive to the active form of PDC, a "push-pull" system that, combined with the developmental and hormonal control of IPG-P, indicates their powerful regulatory function. The release of IPGs from cell membranes by insulin is significant in relation to diabetes. The chelation of IPGs with Mn2+ and Zn2+ suggests a role as "catalytic chelators" coordinating the traffic of metal ions in cells. Synthetic inositol hexosamine analogues are shown here to have a similar linear/sigmoidal reciprocal action on PDC exerting push-pull effects, suggesting their potential for treatment of metabolic disorders, including diabetes.
