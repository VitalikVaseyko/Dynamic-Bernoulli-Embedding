Cancer cells enhance their glycolysis, producing lactate, even in the presence of oxygen. Glycolysis is a series of ten metabolic reactions catalysed by enzymes whose expression is most often increased in tumour cells. HKII and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) have mainly an antiapoptotic effect; PGI and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activate survival pathways (Akt and so on); phosphofructokinase 1 and triose phosphate isomerase participate in cell cycle activation; aldolase promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition; PKM2 enhances various nuclear effects such as transcription, stabilisation and so on. This review outlines the multiple non-glycolytic roles of glycolytic enzymes, which are essential for promoting cancer cells' survival, proliferation, chemoresistance and dissemination.
