Glycolytic enzymes are a group of sarcoplasmic enzymes responsible for the extraction of the energy available from carbohydrates. The glycolytic pathway consists of 10 enzyme-catalyzed steps. Fragments identified in this study, within the range 1100-2600 Da, correspond to glycogen phosphorylase enzyme, which catalyzes the rate limiting step in the degradation of glycogen, enzymes that catalyze steps 6-10 of glycolysis (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase, respectively), and lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate. A total of 45 specific fragments of these enzymes resulting from the processing of dry-cured ham are reported for the first time in this work. This study evidences the intense proteolysis occurring in the sarcoplasmic fraction of dry-cured ham as well as facilitates the choice of the most adequate tools in the identification of naturally generated peptides through comparison between Paragon and Mascot search engines, together with UniProt and NCBInr databases.
