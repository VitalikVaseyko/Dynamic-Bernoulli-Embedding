Polytrauma (PT) leads to systemic activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Organ damage commonly found in these patients is ascribed to respiratory bursts of activated PMNs. With the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PMN extracts from PT patients were found to contain a clear protein band not seen in control PMNs from healthy volunteers. This band was identified by amino acid sequencing and Western blotting as pyruvate kinase (PK). Enzymatic assays revealed a 600-fold increase in PK activity in PMNs of PT patients, with the highest levels occurring between the fifth and seventh posttraumatic day. In lymphocytes, no such increase was detectable. As PK is a major regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, glucose-dependent lactate production in PMNs from PT patients was assayed. These cells showed a higher glycolytic lactate production than controls. It was additionally demonstrated that acute activation of respiratory burst activity depends mainly on breakdown of glucose to lactate via the pentose-phosphate pathway and glycolysis. In PMNs from PT patients, this glucose-dependent respiratory burst activity was more than twofold higher than in controls. The increase in expression and activity of PK in PMNs from PT patients may contribute to the high glucose-dependent respiratory burst activity seen in these cells.
