The effects of seasonal change, November versus July, and prolonged anoxia (96 h under N2 gas) on the properties of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase from five tissues (gill, mantle, hepatopancreas, phasic adductor, catch adductor) of the oyster, Crassostrea virginica were investigated. Both enzymes showed tissue-specific and season-specific changes in kinetic properties; for pyruvate kinase this correlated with seasonal differences in enzyme elution patterns on hydroxylapatite chromatography. Kinetic properties of both enzymes in winter were consistent with primarily catabolic roles in glycolysis with responsiveness to cellular energy demands, whereas in summer these enzymes may be more closely regulated with respect to the biosynthetic and gluconeogenic functions of the tissues. Anoxia-induced changes in phosphofructokinase properties were relatively minor but anoxia stimulated changes in pyruvate kinase properties and elution profiles on hydroxylapatite in all tissues except mantle, with much greater effects seen for the enzyme from winter versus summer animals. For example, anoxia-induced changes in pyruvate kinase from winter gill included a fourfold rise in the substrate affinity constant for phosphoenolpyruvate, a sevenfold increase in the concentration of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate needed to activate the enzyme by 50%, and a 50% decrease in the concentration of L-alanine that inhibits activity by 50%. Changes in pyruvate kinase kinetics and hydroxylapatite elution patterns during prolonged anoxia are consistent with covalent modification of pyruvate kinase but contrary to results for many other mollusc species, anoxia exposure appears to induce a dephosphorylation of the enzyme.
