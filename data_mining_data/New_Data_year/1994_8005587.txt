Two polymorphisms, one in the liver-type pyruvate kinase gene (PKLR) and one in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), both of which are on band q21 of chromosome 1, were found to be tightly linked. Each of three Gaucher disease mutations in 112 chromosomes studied was associated with a unique haplotype. With a conservative assumption about the length of time that the Gaucher disease mutation has been present in the Jewish population, we deduce that the genetic distance between these two loci is probably under 0.2 centimorgans. Four haplotypes are produced by these polymorphic loci, but two of these are relatively uncommon because the polymorphic sites are in linkage disequilibrium. Nonetheless these markers are potentially useful in the prenatal diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency in families who have at least one affected child and may also be helpful in heterozygote detection in families with Gaucher disease where a specific mutation producing the disease in unknown.
