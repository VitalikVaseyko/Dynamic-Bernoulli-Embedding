The hypoglycemic effect of Bordetella pertussis (Challenge strain No.18323) purified cell extract (protein with traces of carbohydrates, 2 mg%) administered (0.1 mg/100 g body wt. i.v.) into mice on the activities of the key regulatory enzymes, viz. glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) and lactate dehydrogenase, of glycolytic pathway in liver has been studied at varying intervals after injection. The maximum hypoglycaemic effect was observed at the end of 12 hr, while activities of all the enzymes studied showed significant enhancement after 18 hr, thus suggesting increased glucose utilization towards the formation of pyruvate. Actinomycin D is found to inhibit stimulation of G-6-PD activity in B. pertussis treated animals, thereby indicating the role of B. pertussis in synthesis of this enzyme.
