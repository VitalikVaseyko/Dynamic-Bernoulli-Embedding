This study aims to explore the effects of shRNA-mediated silencing on Pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2) gene during aerobic glycolysis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 136 patients diagnosed with qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to detect mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2. CRC cells were divided into a blank, vector, and PKM2-shRNA groups. Hexokinase (HK) and PKM2 activity were both determined by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) coupled colorimetric assay and enzyme coupling rate method. The extracellular lactate concentration was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer and caspase activity was measured using spectrophotometry. The proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of CRC cells were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, flow cytometry, transwell assay, and scratch test. Three groups of nude mice were injected with 0.2 mL single-cell suspension from the blank, vector, and PKM2-shRNA groups, respectively. PKM2 protein content in CRC tissues was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. Results showed that the PKM2-shRNA group exhibited significantly lower mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2, decreased PKM2 activity, reduced lactate metabolism level, increased cell apoptosis rate, elevated caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, weakened proliferation, and a reduction in cell invasion and migration ability compared to the vector and blank groups. The optical density (OD) value was lower in the PKM2-shRNA group than in the blank and vector groups. These findings indicate that shRNA-mediated silencing of PKM2 gene promotes apoptosis and inhibits aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cells. J. Cell.
