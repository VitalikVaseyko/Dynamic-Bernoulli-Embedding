Reactive oxygen species (ROS), while vital for normal cellular function, can have harmful effects on cells, leading to the development of diseases such as cancer. The Warburg effect, the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, even in the presence of adequate oxygen, is an important metabolic change that confers many growth and survival advantages to cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species are important regulators of the Warburg effect. The mitochondria-localized antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is vital to survival in our oxygen-rich atmosphere because it scavenges mitochondrial ROS. MnSOD is important in cancer development and progression. However, the significance of MnSOD in the regulation of the Warburg effect is just now being revealed, and it may significantly impact the treatment of cancer in the future.
