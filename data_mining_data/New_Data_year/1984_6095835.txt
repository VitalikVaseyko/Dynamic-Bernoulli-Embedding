Recently, glucagon and its second messenger, cyclic AMP, have been shown to stimulate the transcription rate of several upper eukaryotic genes (1-5). We show here that glucagon can also block gene transcription. Both glucagon and cyclic AMP were found to inhibit the transcription of the genes encoding three liver glycolytic enzymes, including L-type pyruvate kinase and aldolase B. Thus, cyclic AMP proves to be not only an activator but also an inhibitor of gene transcription in eukaryotes.
