We conducted an allozyme electrophoretic study to explore potential enzyme markers to distinguish Opisthorchis viverrini in Thailand and Lao PDR. Twenty-eight enzymes encoding presumptive 32 loci were established. The enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase were diagnostic between two geographically separate isolates from Thailand. Twelve enzymes, ie, aconitate hydratase, aldolase, creatine kinase, enolase, esterases, fumarate hydratase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose-phosphate isomerase, alanine aminotransferase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and pyruvate kinase, also provided diagnostic markers for these two isolates from Thailand and one isolate from Lao PDR.
