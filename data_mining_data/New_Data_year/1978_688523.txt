This study investigated altered pyruvate metabolism after prolonged oral arsenic exposure. Male rats were given access to deionized drinking water containing 0, 40 or 85 ppm sodium arsenate (As5+) for 3 weeks. Respiration studies with mitochondria isolated from treated animals indicated decreased state 3 respiration (with ADP) and decreased respiratory control ratios (RCR) for pyruvate/malate-mediated respiration, but not for succinate-mediated respiration, as compared to control respiration values. In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was measured, in both liver and intestine, before and after Mg-activation in vitro. After 3 weeks, the effects of arsenic at the highest dose level were pronounced on the basal pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (before activation) as well as the total pyruvate dehydrogenase (after activation). The inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity both before and after Mg-activation suggests an arsenic effect on mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism which, in part, involves inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylase. Evidence is also presented which may indicate an arsenic effect on the kinase and/or phosphatase which regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.
