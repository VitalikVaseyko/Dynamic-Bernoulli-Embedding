The kinetic influence of bound creatine kinase (CK) on the Ca(2+)-activated myosin ATPase was evaluated. ATPase rates were measured from 0.8 microM to 3.2 mM MgATP. Under control conditions, the apparent KmATP was 79.9 +/- 13.3 microM. In contrast, the addition of 12.2 mM phosphocreatine (PCr) decreased the apparent KmATP to a value of 13.6 +/- 1.4 microM. To determine if this reduction was merely the result of an ATP maintenance system, ATP was regenerated using either phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase (PEP-PK), or PCr and soluble bovine cardiac CK. Data obtained with PEP + PK indicated an apparent KmATP of 65.5 +/- 7.3 microM. To study the effects of exogenous CK, the endogenous CK was irreversibly inhibited with 1 mM iodoacetamide. The kinetics of the ATPase were then examined by adding soluble CK to the incubation medium. Under these conditions, the KmATP was 56.4 +/- 0.86 microM. Therefore, these two ATP regeneration systems could not duplicate the effects of endogenous CK. The reduction of the apparent KmATP by endogenous CK was not the result of an altered inhibition by MgADP. MgADP inhibition was determined to be non-competitive, with a Ki of 5.0 +/- 0.1 mM. These data suggest that the observed kinetic effects reflect the proximity of the enzymes in the myofibrillar bundle, thus emphasizing the importance of bound CK for the localized regeneration of MgATP utilized by the myosin ATPase.
