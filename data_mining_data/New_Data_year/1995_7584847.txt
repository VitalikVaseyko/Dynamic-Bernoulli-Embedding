The activity and some kinetic parameters of the key enzymes of the glycolysis, the gluconeogenesis and the amino acid catabolism from the liver of male and female mink have been determined and compared to the corresponding activities from rat and cat. The activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and pyruvate kinase are dependent on sex, both being higher in females. Except for pyruvate carboxylase the glycolytic and the gluconeogenic enzyme activities of the mink are higher than those of rat and cat; especially the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase are markedly higher. The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase are smaller than the corresponding activities of rat but higher than those of cat. The results suggest that mink has a high capacity for gluconeogenesis compared to rat.
