In the present paper, the in vitro activities of 10 osmium(III) complexes with [OSIII(L)] degrees structure against promastigote forms of Leishmania donovani and epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi haven been assayed. The complexes OSIII-2,4dinitroimidazole dithiocarbamate, OSIII-4-nitroimidazole dithiocarbamate, OSIII-benznidazole dithiocarbamate and OSIII-2-amino-6-Br-benzothiazole dithiocarbamate induced high percentages of growth inhibition in the parasites. The four compounds showed moderate cell toxicity. The inhibitory effects of these complexes on macromolecule synthesis have been evaluated using [3H]-thymidine, [3H]-uridine and [3H]-leucine incorporation. These metal-drug complexes clearly inhibit the DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, as well as the enzymatic activities of succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase.
