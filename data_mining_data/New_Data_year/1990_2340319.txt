The effect of pH on the main kinetic parameters of pyruvate kinase function was studied. The maximal rate of the reaction as well as the values of Km for ADP and Ki for phenylalanine depend on pH and show a well-defined extremum at pH 6.8-7.0. Spectrofluorimetric titration of pyruvate kinase results in pH dependencies of changes in the fluorescence spectra parameters (e.g., quantum yield, half-width and position of the maximum). This enabled to determine the pH regions corresponding to changes in the state of tryptophan residues. Data from the enzyme inhibition by phenylalanine suggest that acidification of the medium leads to the decrease of the catalytic activity due to the protonation of the ionogenic group of the enzyme. Within the pH range of 7.0-8.0, the decrease of the pyruvate kinase activity is due to structural shifts in the enzyme molecule, as a result of which the steric complementariness of the enzyme active center with respect to the substrate (Mg.ADP) is impaired.
