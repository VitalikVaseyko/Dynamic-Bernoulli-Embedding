Although seasonal metabolic variation in ectothermic tetrapods has been investigated primarily in the context of species showing some level of metabolic depression during winter, but several species of anurans maintain their activity patterns throughout the year in tropical and subtropical areas. The tree-frog Hypsiboas prasinus occurs in the subtropical Atlantic Forest and remains reproductively active during winter, at temperatures below 10 degrees C. We compared males calling in summer and winter, and found that males of H. prasinus exhibit seasonal adjustments in metabolic and morphometric variables. Individuals calling during winter were larger and showed higher resting metabolic rates than those calling during summer. Calling rates were not affected by season. Winter animals showed lower liver and heart activity level of citrate synthase (CS), partially compensated by larger liver mass. Winter individuals also showed higher activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lower activity of CS in trunk muscles, and higher activity of CS in leg muscles. Winter metabolic adjustments seem to be achieved by both compensatory mechanisms to the lower environmental temperature and a seasonally oriented aerobic depression of several organs. The impact of seasonal metabolic changes on calling performance and the capacity of subtropical anurans for metabolic thermal acclimatization are also discussed.
