In this work, it is shown that the Ca2+-transport ATPase found in the microsomal fraction of the cerebellum can use both glucose 6-phosphate/hexokinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate/phosphofructokinase as ATP-regenerating systems. The vesicles derived from the cerebellum were able to accumulate Ca2+ in a medium containing ADP when either glucose 6-phosphate and hexokinase or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphofructokinase were added to the medium. There was no Ca2+ uptake if one of these components was omitted from the medium. The transport of Ca2+ was associated with the cleavage of sugar phosphate. The maximal amount of Ca2+ accumulated by the vesicles with the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate system was larger than that measured either with glucose 6-phosphate or with a low ATP concentration and phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase. The Ca2+ uptake supported by glucose 6-phosphate was inhibited by glucose, but not by fructose 6-phosphate. In contrast, the Ca2+ uptake supported by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was inhibited by fructose 6-phosphate, but not by glucose. Thapsigargin, a specific SERCA inhibitor, impaired the transport of Ca2+ sustained by either glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. It is proposed that the use of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as an ATP-regenerating system by the cerebellum Ca2+-ATPase may represent a salvage route used at early stages of ischemia; this could be used to energize the Ca2+ transport, avoiding the deleterious effects derived from the cellular acidosis promoted by lactic acid.
