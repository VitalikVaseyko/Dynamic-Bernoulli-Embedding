An increase in bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) and a decrease in pyruvate kinase (PK), i.e. a decrease in PK/BPGM ratio, was observed in red cell populations from anemic rats containing 95% down to 3% reticulocytes in blood. Such a ratio has been used to study the fractionation of recticulocytes, according to their degree of maturation, after counter-current distribution of those cell populations in dextranpoly (ethylene glycol) two-phase systems. When applying this procedure to the fractionation according to age of erythrocytes from normal rats, the decrease of PK with cellular age was observed without a significant variation in BPGM activity.
