Protein kinases regulate numerous cellular processes, including cell growth, metabolism, and cell death. Because the primary sequence and the three-dimensional structure of many kinases are highly similar, the development of selective inhibitors for only one kinase is challenging. Furthermore, many protein kinases are pleiotropic, mediating diverse and sometimes even opposing functions by phosphorylating multiple protein substrates. Here, we set out to develop an inhibitor of a selective protein kinase phosphorylation of only one of its substrates. Focusing on the pleiotropic delta protein kinase C (deltaPKC), we used a rational approach to identify a distal docking site on deltaPKC for its substrate, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). We reasoned that an inhibitor of PDK's docking should selectively inhibit the phosphorylation of only PDK without affecting phosphorylation of the other deltaPKC substrates. Our approach identified a selective inhibitor of PDK docking to deltaPKC with an in vitro Kd of approximately 50 nM and reducing cardiac injury IC50 of approximately 5 nM. This inhibitor, which did not affect the phosphorylation of other deltaPKC substrates even at 1 muM, demonstrated that PDK phosphorylation alone is critical for deltaPKC-mediated injury by heart attack. The approach we describe is likely applicable for the identification of other substrate-specific kinase inhibitors.
