We have investigated the potential role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in controlling levels of enzymes of energy metabolism in primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle cells. Incubating myotubes with cholera toxin or forskolin (2 persistent activators of adenylate cyclase) significantly increased the levels of two enzymes of oxidative metabolism, fumarase and malate dehydrogenase. These enzymes were also increased (1.5- to 2.0-fold) by phosphodiesterase inhibitors (caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, papaverine, MJ 1988, Ro 20-1724, or SQ 20009) and the cAMP derivatives: 8-bromo-cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP. In contrast two enzymes of glycolytic metabolism, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, were not consistently affected by these agents. The results presented provide strong evidence that an increase in cAMP can lead to an increase in certain enzymes of oxidative energy metabolism.
