Berberine (BBR) can potentially be used as a drug against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes. Our previous study found that BBR could change the pattern of DNA methylation. But the mechanisms underlying berberine are still far from completely understood. In this study, the function of L-PK in cell metabolism was explored, and high-fat-diet induced SD rats NAFLD models were created. The NAFLD rats were randomly grouped to be oral administration with BBR at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily. Then DNA methylation and histone acetylation around the L-type Pyruvate Kinase (L-PK) gene were examined. In the results, we found that L-PK had a positive effect on cell proliferation, glucose utilization and triglyceride metabolism. However, the expression of L-PK was reduced in the livers of NAFLD rats, in accord with the decrease of DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in the regulatory regions of L-PK. Notably, BBR treatment can restore the expression of L-PK by the demethylation of L-PK promoter and the increase in acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 around L-PK, which indicated that BBR may be a potential drug for epigenetic-included diseases.
