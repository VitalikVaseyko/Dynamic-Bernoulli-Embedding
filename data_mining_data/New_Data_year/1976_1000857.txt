A mutant erythrocyte isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PK) (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) has been found in associatin with chronic hemolytic anemia in two siblings who were doubly heterozygous for the isozyme and for quantitative PK deficiency of the usual form. The isozyme was characterized by approximately normal maximum reaction velocities but had markedly decreased affinity for the substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with 5-fold to 10-fold increases in half-saturation constants and decreased interaction between substrate binding sites. Two distinctly separable kinetic patterns for PEP were observed with multiple specimens. Concentrations of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) required for half-maximal activation were two orders of magnitude greater than controls, and optimal pH was lowered to 6.5. stability at 4 degrees C was markedly decreased, but the lost enzyme could be reactivated by fdp for periods even longer than normal controls.
