BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are related to the occurrence and development of many human diseases, such as cancer and the HELLP and the brachydactyly syndromes. However, studies of LncRNA in heart failure have not yet been reported. Here, we investigated cardiac lncRNA expression profiles in the myocardial-specific knockout pdk1 gene (KO) mouse model of heart failure. METHODS: Cardiac samples were obtained from PDK1 KO and WT mice on postnatal (P) day 8 (P8) and day 40 (P40), and lncRNA expression profiles were analyzed by sequencing and screening using the Arraystar mouse lncRNA microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of these lncRNAs confirmed the identity of some genes. RESULTS: Comparisons of the KO and control groups showed fold changes of >1.5 in the expression levels of 2,024 lncRNAs at P8, while fold changes of >2 in the expression levels of 4,095 lncRNAs were detected at P40. Nineteen lncRNAs were validated by RT-PCR. Bioinformatic and pathway analyses indicated that mkk7, a sense overlap lncRNA, may be involved in the pathological processes of heart failure through the MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These data reveal differentially expressed lncRNA in mice with a myocardial-specific deletion of the pdk1 gene, which may provide new insights into the mechanism of heart failure in PDK1 knockout mice.
