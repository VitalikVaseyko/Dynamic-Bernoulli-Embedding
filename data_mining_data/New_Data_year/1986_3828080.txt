Feeding a basal diet free of vitamins E and C to weanling male rats for 8 months resulted in biochemical changes characteristic of vitamin E deficiency. These included increased liver thiobarbituric acid values; decreased blood GSH levels, plasma vitamin E levels, and glutathione peroxidase activities; and increased activities of plasma pyruvate kinase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, and malic dehydrogenase. Tube-feeding vitamin C for 21 days resulted in partial reversal effects on the above parameters except activities of glutathione peroxidase, lactic dehydrogenase, and malic dehydrogenase. The results suggest that vitamin C may spare in part the metabolism of vitamin E through its antioxidant property.
