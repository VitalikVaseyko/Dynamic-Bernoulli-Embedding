Many reports from recent years indicate the important role of fecal markers of inflammation. These are proteins produced by neutrocytes, monocytes and hepatocytes. The concentration of these proteins increases in the process of inflammation. These parameters are very sensitive because changes in their levels particularly reflect inflammatory conditions in the intestines. In this study we discuss the role of measurements of proteins such as: alpha 1-antitrypsin, myeloperoxydase, lactoferrin, calprotectin, S100A12 protein and pyruvate kinase in stool. The largest number of studies indicating the usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring the course of inflammatory bowel diseases concerns stool lactoferrin and calprotectin.
