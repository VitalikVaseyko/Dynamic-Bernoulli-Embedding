Mature erythrocytes contain a specific isozyme of pyruvate kinase (R-PK) while immature erythroblasts coexpress R-PK and another isozyme, M2-PK. To determine what roles degradation and decreasing of synthesis played in the disappearance of M2-PK during erythroid maturation, M2-PK and R-PK synthesis and degradation were studied in erythroblasts from fetal liver and blood BFU-E-derived erythroblasts from healthy subjects, an erythroleukemic patient, and a patient with an erythrocyte PK hyperactivity associated with M2-PK persistence in mature erythrocytes. In normal erythroblasts, R-PK synthesis was constant throughout erythroid maturation, whereas M2-PK synthesis decreased to the point of becoming undetectable. R-PK degradation was very low, while M2-PK degradation was more pronounced and steady during erythroid maturation. In leukemic erythroblasts, total protein turnover was higher than in normal cells, but the M2-PK degradation rate was lower. In erythroblasts from the patient with M2-PK persistence in mature erythrocytes, M2-PK synthesis did not decline with cell maturation. In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of the decrease of M2-PK synthesis in the disappearance of M2-PK during erythroid maturation. Further studies of patients with pathologic persistence of M2-PK synthesis will help in the understanding of this event involved in erythroid maturation.
