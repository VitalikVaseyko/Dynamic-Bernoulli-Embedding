Eleven independent man-mouse hybrids and 40 subclones from four to them were analysed for up to 42 enzyme markers. Nine subclones from three hybrid lines were fully karyotyped. The data presented suggest that the gene for the human enzyme MOR-M can be assigned to chromosome 7, whilst those for MPI and PK-3 are on chromosome 15. The use of a small number of well-characterized hybrids for gene assigments is discussed as well as the significance of some known human linkage relationships.
