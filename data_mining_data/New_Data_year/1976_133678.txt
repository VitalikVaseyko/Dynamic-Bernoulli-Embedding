1. Cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP and ADP concentrations of liver cells isolated from normal fed, starved and diabetic rats were determined. 2. The cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio was 6,9 and 10 in normal fed, starved and diabetic rats respectively. 3. The mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio was 2 in normal and diabetic rats and 1.6 in starved rats. 4. Adenosine increased the cytosolic and lowered the mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio, whereas atractyloside had the opposite effect. 5. Incubation of the hepatocytes with fructose, glycerol or sorbitol led to a fall in the ATP/ADP ratio in both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial compartment. 6. The interrelationship between the mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and the phosphorylation state of pyruvate dehydrogenase in intact cells was studied. 7. In hepatocytes isolated from fed rats an inverse correlation between the mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio and the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate dehydrogenase a) was demonstrable on loading with fructose, glycerol or sorbitol. 8. No such correlation was obtained with pyruvate or dihydroxyacetone. For pyruvate, this can be explained by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. 9. Liver cells isolated from fed animals displayed pyruvate dehydrogenase a activity twice that found in vivo. Physiological values were obtained when the hepatocytes were incubated with albumin-oleate, which also yielded the highest mitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio.
