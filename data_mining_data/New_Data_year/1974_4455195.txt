1. Kinetics of fructose 1,6-diphosphate activation of liver pyruvate kinase type I inhibited with MgATP and l-alanine are described as a function of enzyme and fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations. These results can be explained by a single pseudo-first-order transition of the enzyme into an active form, independent of the enzyme concentration. This rate constant, k(app.)=0.24s(-1) with 0.02mm-fructose 1,6-diphosphate (t(0.9) approximately 10s where t(0.9) is the time for 90% conversion), is an increasing function of fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentration far beyond that needed to maximally activate enzyme equilibrated with fructose 1,6-diphosphate (about 20mum). 2. The model equations are best analysed with numerical techniques which are described. These techniques are useful in studying similar slow transients frequently observed in stopped-flow studies of enzymes. 3. Shorter transients (t(0.9)=0.5-1.5s) were observed in the kinetic response of the enzyme to the addition of MgATP or phosphoenolpyruvate, but were not further characterized.
