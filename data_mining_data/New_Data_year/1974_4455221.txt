The isolation of a salt-soluble homogeneous elastin from the aortas of lathyritic chicks by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and salt precipitation is described. These new techniques, as well as some previously published by other workers, were evaluated with the help of antiserum raised in sheep against insoluble chick elastin. The purified elastin was very basic and behaved in a predictable manner in coacervation studies. The protein migrated in sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels as a single band moving slightly faster than pyruvate kinase (mol.wt. 57000).
