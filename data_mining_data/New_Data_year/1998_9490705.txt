The Pk-1slc gene encodes a mutant red blood cell (RBC) type pyruvate kinase (PK), and adult CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice show a severe nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. However, the number of RBCs and the proportion of reticulocytes were comparable between neonatal CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice and control -+/+ mice. Since the age-dependent increase of RBCs was much greater in CBA-+/+ mice than in CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice, significant anemia was observed in the latter mice on day 14 after birth. The increase of RBCs in CBA-+/+ mice was due to the prolongation of their survival time. The half life of RBCs increased in CBA-+/+ mice with ages, but it decreased in CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice. The relatively longer half life of RBCs in neonatal CBA-Pk-1slc/Pk-1slc mice appeared to be due to the delayed switching from M2-type PK that are expressed by undifferentiated erythroid precursor cells to RBC-type PK that are expressed by mature RBCs.
