A method based on pseudoaffinity chromatography has been developed for the separation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) and aldolase from rabbit muscle extract using cross-linked guar (CLG) and cross-linked pectin (CLP) as the matrices, and dyes as the ligands. Screening of several dyes revealed that dyes No. 1014 and No. 1015, immobilized on CLG and CLP displayed a higher affinity for LDH and PK. Aldolase was not retained on any of the dye columns. It was observed that 1014-CLP and 1014-CLG columns retained 90% and 55% LDH activities, respectively, whereas 1015-CLP and 1015-CLG retained 83% LDH and 72% PK. A coupled-column system comprising 1014-CLP and 1015-CLP or 1014-CLG and 1015-CLG could separate LDH, PK, and aldolase from a mixture of these enzymes, as well as from rabbit muscle extract. Enzymes were found to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The method has been found to be simple and economical.
