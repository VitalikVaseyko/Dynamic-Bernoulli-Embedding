In Type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis is impaired due to either a decrease in insulin secretion or insulin action. In this symposium, molecular targets that could have an impact on either or both of these defects were discussed and data related to specific compounds were presented. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors that relieve the negative control on insulin action and are active in cell assays, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors that raise postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 levels in animals and humans, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors that increase the levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which in turn improve insulin sensitivity, were all discussed. Roche presented for the first time their novel glucokinase activators and discussed both the in vitro and in vivo activity profiles of representative glucokinase activators as potential therapy for Type 2 diabetes. Second generation retinoid X receptor modulators that retain the desirable effects of full agonists, while devoid of their negative attributes, such as triglyceride accumulation, were discussed. Also, clinical efficacy results of synthetic exendin-4, Exenatide trade mark, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, were presented. In the area of obesity, agonists of several central (melanocortin type 4, serotonin subtype 2C and cannabinoid receptor 1) receptors and one peripheral G-protein-coupled receptor, cholecystokinin receptor-A, all of which lead to reduced food intake in animals, were discussed.
