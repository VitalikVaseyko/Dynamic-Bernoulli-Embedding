We wanted to verity whether M2-PK is a useful marker in testicular cancer. In a prospective study of 20 consecutive patients, blood was drawn from the testicular and the cubital vein before semicastration and later. For the detection of M2-PK we used the Assay of ScheboTech. In the testicular vein M2-PK was 11.2 U/ml. In the cubital vein it was 6.2 U/ml before semicastration, increasing in the following days. There were no significant differences between testicular and cubital vein blood, between the non-metastasized patients and the metastasized stages and between the patients with seminoma and non-seminomatous tumors. There is no profit in the diagnosis of testicular cancer using Tu-M2-PK.
