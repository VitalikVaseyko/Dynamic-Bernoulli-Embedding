Dietary antioxidants interact in a dynamic fashion, including recycling and sparing one another, to decrease oxidative stress. Limited information is available regarding the interrelationships in vivo between quercetin and vitamin E. We investigated the antioxidant activity and metabolism of quercetin (Q) in 65 F-344 rats (n=13 per group) randomly assigned to the following vitamin E (VE)-replete and -deficient diets: (a) VE replete (30 mg alpha-tocopherol acetate/kg diet) control ad libitum (C-AL), (b) VE replete pair fed (C-PF), (c) VE replete+5.0 g Q/kg diet (R-VE+5Q), (d) VE deplete (<1 mg/kg total tocopherols)+5.0 g Q/kg diet (D-VE+5Q) and (e) D-VE. After 12 weeks, blood and tissue were collected for measurement of plasma vitamin E, quercetin and its metabolites, serum pyruvate kinase (PK), plasma protein carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity. D-VE diets decreased serum alpha-tocopherol and increased PK activity in a time-dependent manner. The D-VE diet increased plasma protein carbonyls but did not affect MDA. Dietary quercetin supplementation increased quercetin and its metabolites in plasma and liver but did not affect D-VE-induced changes in plasma alpha-tocopherol, PK or protein carbonyls. Plasma isorhamnetin and its disposition in muscle were enhanced by the D-VE diet, as compared to the R-VE diet. Conversely, tamarixetin disposition in muscle was decreased by the D-VE diet. Thus, quercetin did not slow vitamin E decline in vivo; neither did it provide antioxidant activity in vitamin-E-depleted rats. However, vitamin E status appears to enhance the distribution of isorhamnetin into the circulation and its disposition in muscle.
