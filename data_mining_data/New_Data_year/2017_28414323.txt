PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), a critical regulator of glycolysis, is phosphorylated by numerous growth factor receptors and oncogenic tyrosine kinases including NPM-ALK which is expressed in a subset of aggressive T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-positive. Our previous work demonstrated that phosphorylation of Y105-PKM2 by NPM-ALK regulates a major metabolic shift to promote lymphomagenesis. In addition to its role in metabolism, recent studies have shown that PKM2 promotes oncogenesis by phosphorylating nuclear STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and regulating transcription of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation. We hypothesized that identification of novel PKM2 interactors could provide additional insights into its expanding functional role in cancer. To this end, immunocomplexes of FLAG-tagged PKM2 were isolated from NPM-ALK-positive ALCL (anaplastic large cell lymphoma) cells and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which led to the identification of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) as a novel interactor of PKM2. The interaction between PTBP1 and PKM2 was restricted to the nucleus and was dependent on NPM-ALK mediated Y105 phosphorylation of PKM2. Stable shRNA-mediated silencing of PTBP1 resulted in a marked decrease in pY105-PKM2 and pY705-STAT3 which led to decreased ALCL cell proliferation and colony formation. Overall, our data demonstrate that PTBP1 interacts with PKM2 and promotes ALCL oncogenesis by facilitating PKM2-dependent activation of STAT3 within the nucleus.
