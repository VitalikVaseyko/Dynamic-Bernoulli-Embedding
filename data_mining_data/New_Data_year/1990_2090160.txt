The effects of the administration of insulin and glucagon on the intraacinar heterotopy of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were investigated in male and female rat liver. Insulin did not noticeably influence PEPCK activity or its acinar distribution, either in males or in females. But it affected the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme. Glucagon in supraphysiological concentrations led to an induction of PEPCK activity. Despite high glucagon concentration along the whole sinusoidal length, the inducing effect of glucagon was most pronounced in the periportal and intermediary parts of the acinus; thus indicating that there is no direct interrelationship between local glucagon concentration and PEPCK activity. In both experiments blood glucose levels were kept fairly constant.
