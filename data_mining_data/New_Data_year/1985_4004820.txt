A large part of the hexokinase activity of the rat brain 20,000g supernatant became mitochondrial bound when incubated with rat heart mitochondria which had been pretreated with glucose-6-phosphate. This binding was dependent on small-molecular compounds (as yet unidentified) of the brain supernatant. Divalent cations, spermine, and pentalysine strongly stimulated the binding of brain supernatant hexokinase to heart mitochondria. Inorganic phosphate, alpha-glycerophosphate, and fructose-1,6-diphosphate showed some stimulatory effect. No effect was observed with insulin or glucose. Mitochondria isolated from hearts of fasted rats had less specific hexokinase activity than mitochondria from fasted and then carbohydrate refed rats. This dietary treatment had no significant effect on the total heart hexokinase activity. Oligomycin did not inhibit the formation of creatine phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate by isolated rabbit heart mitochondria incubated in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. However, the presence of creatine inhibited the formation of glucose-6-phosphate when the ATP/ADP ratio was low, indicating that creatine kinase has a greater access to ATP/ADP translocation than has hexokinase.
