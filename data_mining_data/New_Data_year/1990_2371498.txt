The specific activity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was measured in 41 smooth muscle cell tumors: 20 leiomyomas and 21 cases of leiomyosarcoma. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in specific activity between normal smooth muscle tissue and the benign and malignant tumors originating from it. Quantification of the isozyme composition of pyruvate kinase showed a significant shift in isozyme pattern towards K-type subunits in leiomyosarcomas as compared to leiomyomas.
