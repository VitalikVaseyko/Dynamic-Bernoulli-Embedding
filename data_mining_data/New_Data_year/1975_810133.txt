We have compared the solubility, kinetic, immunological, and electrophoretic properties of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase from normal dogs and Basenji dogs with congenital hemolytic anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency. Differences can be detected between the two enzymes by all methods. The enzyme from the affected animals has a greater solubility in ammonium sulfate. It has a lower Km for phosphoenolpyruvate, while the Km for ADP is increased. This enzyme is not inhibited by ATP or activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The enzyme from the affected animals has none of the allosteric properties characteristic of the normal canine enzyme. No difference can be detected by enzyme inactivation with rabbit antiserum against human erythrocyte enzyme, but a slight spur is observed on comparison of the two enzymes by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. The enzymes also differ in their electrophoretic mobilities on starch gel electrophoresis.
