Pyravate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-0 phosphotransferase E.C.2.7.1.40) was purified from Brochothrix thermosphacta. The enzyme is a homotetramer of monomer Mr 58,000. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate stimulates activity and promotes hyperbolic kinetics although it is not essential for enzyme activity. The positive effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on activity is repressed by inorganic phosphate which enhances cooperative kinetics. Unlike pyruvate kinases from other sources, the Brochothrix enzyme is uncompetitively inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, although at high concentration. ATP is a strong inhibitor of pyruvate kinase and shifts the residual activity/pH profile towards more alkaline values.
