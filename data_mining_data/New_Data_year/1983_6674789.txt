Some experimental and clinical studies were done from the metabolic viewpoint to elucidate the characteristics of myonephropathic-metabolic syndrome. In experimental dogs with their femoral arteries ligated and two third of femoral muscles divided, aldolase and myoglobin showed remarkable increase without significant changes in electrolytes. Slight increase of GPT and GOT was observed. Amino acids showed elevation in urea, taurin, leucin, isoleucin, valine, threonine, 3-methylhistidine, phenylalanine, histidine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine and anserin and decrease in glutamine, alanine, glycine, proline, carnosine, citrullin and arginine. In patients with acute arterial occlusion, potassium, GOT, LDH, CPK, lactate and pyruvate increased moderately and myoglobin showed remarkable increase and aldolase slight increase. Amino acids showed remarkable increase in 3-methylhistidine and beta-amino-isobutyric acid and moderate increase in phenylalanine and arginine. These results revealed that measurement of free amino acid concentration, especially that of methylhistidine as well as myoglobin, pyruvate, lactate and some other enzymes might be of great help to predict the prognosis of patients with acute arterial occlusion of the extremities.
