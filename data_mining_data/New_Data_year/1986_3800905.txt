Highly purified branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC) oxidizes 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and 2-oxobutyrate, with Km values of 67 microM and 18 microM respectively. The Vmax. for oxidation of these substrates is 27% and 53% respectively of that for 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate. Highly purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) oxidizes 2-oxobutyrate (Km 100 microM; Vmax. 49% of that for pyruvate) but not 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate, whereas 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex will not utilize either 2-oxo acid as substrate. BCOADC kinase is inhibited by both 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and 2-oxobutyrate, with half-maximal inhibition by 45 microM and 50 microM respectively. Phosphorylation of BCOADC in isolated adipocytes is inhibited by both 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and 2-oxobutyrate, consistent with their inhibitory action of BCOADC kinase. Phosphorylation of PDC is decreased by 2-oxobutyrate, but not by 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate.
