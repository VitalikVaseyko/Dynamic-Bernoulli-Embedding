We developed a sensitive and nonradioactive fluorometric assay for cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Guanine nucleotides except cGMP were enzymatically phosphorylated to GTP. cGMP, absorbed into a Sep-Pak amino propyl cartridge, was eluted separately from GTP. Purified cGMP was enzymatically converted to GTP, which was applied to the GTP-GDP cycle using succinic thiokinase and pyruvate kinase. When pyruvic acid produced by the GTP-GDP cycle was reduced by lactate dehydrogenase, a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was equivalently oxidized to NAD(+). NAD(+) was further converted into fluorescent compound, which was excited at 370 nm and emitted fluorescence at 460 nm, by a strong alkali. When 20 nmol NADH was used for this assay, the calibration curve over 50 to 500 fmol cGMP became sufficiently linear. The detection limit for cGMP was ca. 5 fmol (signal to noise ratio >3). Using this assay, we confirmed that the cGMP content in the left atrial strip of dog was changed from 11.4 +/- 3.8 to 19.3 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg wet wt of tissue (mean +/- SE, n = 6) by electrical driving at 1 Hz. Carbachol (1 microM) further increased the cGMP to 45.6 +/- 9.2 fmol/mg wet wt of tissue. From these results, it is suggested that this novel assay for cGMP is highly sensitive and can be applied to various biological samples.
