Molybdenum mimics certain insulin actions in vitro. We have investigated the effects of oral administration of Na2MoO4 (Mo) for 8 wk on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Mo decreased hyperglycemia and glucosuria by 75% and corrected the elevation of plasma nonesterified fatty acids. Tolerance to glucose loads was improved, and glycogen stores were replenished. These effects were not due to a rise of insulinemia. In liver, Mo restored the blunted mRNA and activity of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase and decreased to normal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase values. Finally, Mo totally reversed the low expression and activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in liver, but not in white adipose tissue. In conclusion, Mo exerts a marked blood glucose-lowering effect in diabetic rats by an insulin-like action. This effect results in part from a restoration of hepatic glucose metabolism and is associated with a tissue-specific correction of lipogenic enzyme gene expression, both processes being essentially mediated by reversal of impaired pretranslational regulatory mechanisms. These observations raise new therapeutic perspectives in diabetes, particularly in the insulin-resistant condition.
