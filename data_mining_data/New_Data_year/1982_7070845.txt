With few exceptions, the specific activities of the glycolytic enzymes and the steady-state content of glycolytic and associated intermediates in protoscoleces of the horse (E.g.H) and sheep (E.g.S) strains of Echinococcus granulosus and the closely related E. multilocularis (E.m.) are very similar. Phosphorylase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase catalyse non-equilibrium reactions and the patterns of activity for pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase and malic enzyme are similar in the three organisms. The levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in E.g.H., E.g.S. and E.m. are of the same order as those reported in tissues with an active cycle. Each has a complete sequence of cycle enzymes but there are substantial differences between the three parasites with regard to the activity of individual enzymes. The activities of NAD and NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases are significantly lower in E.g.H. than in E.g.S. and particularly in E.m. which suggests that the tricarboxylic acid cycle may play a more important role in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production in the latter parasites. Nevertheless, the three organisms utilize fermentative pathways for alternative energy production, fix carbon dioxide via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and have a partial reversed tricarboxylic acid cycle. It is speculated that in vivo more carbon will be channelled towards oxaloacetate than pyruvate at the phosphonenolpyruvate branch point. The steady state content of ATP and the ATP/AMP ratios are low in the three organisms, suggesting a low rate of ATP utilization in each.
