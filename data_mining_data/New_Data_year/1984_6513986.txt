Glycogen content, glucose consumption and the production of metabolic end products by Calicophoron ijimai were determined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The major end products of fermentation were identified as lactic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric and alpha-methylbutyric acids, propionic acid predominating. The activities and properties of some of the enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism were determined. The worms showed high phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) but relatively low pyruvate kinase and very low lactate dehydrogenase activities. The pH optima, coenzyme, cofactor and ionic requirements of the enzymes were similar to those of other helminths. Malate dehydrogenase had an 8-fold greater affinity for oxaloacetate than malate, and was about 14 times more active for oxaloacetate reduction than malate oxidation. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was 2.4 times more active and had a 2-fold greater affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate and dinucleotide than pyruvate kinase. The low activities of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase but high activities of malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase suggest that anaerobic carbohydrate catabolism follows the fumarate reductase pathway.
