The activity of G-6PD and PK in erythrocytes and ATP content in erythrocyte hemolysate in patients with leucosis (acute, chronic myelo- and chronic lympholeucosis) was investigated. A reduced G-6PD activity was found in the majority of the patients examined, being most markedly manifested in the patients with chronic lympholeucosis and least--in the patients with chronic myeloleucosis. About 50 per cent of the patients with acute leucosis and chronic lympholeucosis have reduced PK activity and in those with chronic myeloleucosis -- increased. ATP content is increased in patients with chronic myeloleucosis and in the rest of the patients -- normal. A disturbance of glucose metabolism in erythrocytes in patients with leucosis is concluded to exist.
