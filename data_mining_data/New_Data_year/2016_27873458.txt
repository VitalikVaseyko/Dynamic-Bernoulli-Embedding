SCOPE: Enhancing the formation and function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases thermogenesis and hence reduces obesity. Thus, we investigate the effects of resveratrol (Resv) on brown adipocyte formation and function in mouse interscapular BAT (iBAT). METHODS AND RESULTS: CD1 mice and stromal vascular cells (SVCs) isolated from iBAT were treated with Resv. Expression of brown adipogenic and thermogenic markers, and involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)alpha1 were assessed. In vivo, Resv-enhanced expression of brown adipogenic markers, PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) and thermogenic genes, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and cytochrome C in iBAT, along with smaller lipid droplets, elevated AMPKalpha activity and increased oxygen consumption. Meanwhile, Resv promoted expression of PRDM16, UCP1, PGC1alpha, cytochrome C and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in differentiated iBAT SVCs, suggesting that Resv enhanced brown adipocyte formation and function in vitro. In addition, Resv stimulated AMPKalpha and oxygen consumption in differentiated iBAT SVCs. However, the promotional effects of Resv were diminished by AMPK inhibition or AMPKalpha1 knockout, implying the involvement of AMPKalpha1 in this process. CONCLUSION: Resv enhanced brown adipocyte formation and thermogenic function in mouse iBAT by promoting the expression of brown adipogenic markers via activating AMPKalpha1, which contributed to the anti-obesity effects of Resv.
