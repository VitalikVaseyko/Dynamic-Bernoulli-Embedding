An effect of methylguanidine and guanidinosuccinic acid on pyruvate kinase activity in human red cells was determined in vitro following a 3-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. The obtained results have shown that methylguanidine in the concentration of 1.8 x 10(-5) M/l inhibits pyruvate kinase activity by 20.8%. Pyruvate kinase activity was statistically significantly inhibited on addition of methylguanidine in the concentration of 5.4 x 10(-5) M/l whereas higher concentrations have no such an effect Guanidinesuccinic acid exerted similar but weaker effect on the activity of pyruvate kinase in human red cells. Mixture of methylguanidine (5.4 x 10(-5) m/l) and guanidinesuccinic acid (2.8 x 10(-5) M/l) does not affect pyruvate kinase activity in normal human red cells under identical experimental conditions.
