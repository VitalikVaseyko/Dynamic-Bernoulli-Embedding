Heat acclimatization was induced in a group of healthy male test subjects by repetitive treadmill walking (5.6 km-h-1, 49 degrees/27 degrees C dry/wet bulb, 90 min-day-1, 7 days). A second group of men, paired for maximal O2 consumption and body weight, remained sedentary under identical environmental conditions. Total plasma protein increased significantly after 45 (P less than 0.05) and 90 (P less than 0.025) min of exercise on the first day of heat exposure, yet after 7 days no increments occurred. Even after heat acclimatization was achieved (day 7), plasma levels of creatine phosphokinase increased during the 90-min walk in the heat (time O vs. 90, P less than 0.025), as was also the case on day 1 (P less than 0.05). Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase were not significantly affected by exercise in the heat either before or after heat acclimatization. No correlations could be drawn between base-line enzyme levels and state of physical conditioning.
