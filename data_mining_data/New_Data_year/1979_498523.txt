A new rapid method for the age fractionation of human erythrocytes by centrifugation through a "Percoll" density gradient is described. The fractionation is demonstrated by density-related changes in the volume, haemoglobin concentration, pyruvate kinase and acetylcholine esterase activities and potassium contents of the erythrocytes, and the distribution of reticulocytes on the gradients.
