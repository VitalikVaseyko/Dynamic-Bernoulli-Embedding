The feasibility of a novel stirred bioreactor, the rotating aerial disk (RAD) design, was tested in this study. The novelty lies in its method of medium recirculation by convective airflow using a non-contact planar disc, a variation on a physically defined theoretical model. Computational predictions of improved oxygenation were confirmed by increases in measured dissolved oxygen, even at Reynolds numbers (100-200) where flow is mostly laminar. EL-4 mouse lymphoma cells grown for the first time as suspension cultures in the RAD bioreactor, were mechanically re-organization into dense, circular three-dimensional colonies (diameter 3-5 mm, thickness 5-800 microm), more rapidly than we have observed previously. Cell proliferation in the RAD vessels was similar to static cultures, although lactate production from glucose was significantly lower, suggesting a shift toward aerobic glycolysis. This possible reversal of the 'Warburg effect' was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial activity, perhaps reflecting a more quiescent cytoplasmic state. The RAD device may be useful as scalable, three-dimensional solid tumor model under more physiological conditions then static culture.
