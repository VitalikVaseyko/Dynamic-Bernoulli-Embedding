Several glycolytic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were radiolabelled by [125I]iodination, conjugation with 125I-labelled Bolton & Hunter reagent and reductive [3H]methylation, and their degradative rates after microinjection into 3T3-L1 cells compared with that of the extracellular protein bovine serum albumin. Although the albumin remains largely cytosolic in recipient cells, the glycolytic enzymes rapidly (less than 30 min) become insoluble, as measured by detergent and salt extractions. The microinjected glycolytic enzymes appear to form disulphide-linked aggregates, are found in a cell fraction rich in vimentin-containing intermediate filaments and histones (nuclear-intermediate-filament fraction), and are degraded slowly by a lysosomal mechanism, as judged by the effects of inhibitors (NH4Cl, leupeptin, 3-methyladenine). 125I-labelled bovine serum albumin appears to be degraded rapidly and non-lysosomally. Prolonged treatment (96 h) of cultured cells with leupeptin results in the accumulation of pulse-labelled ([35S]methionine for 24 h) endogenous cell proteins in the detergent-and salt-non-extractable residue, but NH4Cl and 3-methyladenine do not have this effect. The findings are in terms of the interpretation of experiments involving microinjection of proteins to study intracellular protein protein degradation by autophagy.
