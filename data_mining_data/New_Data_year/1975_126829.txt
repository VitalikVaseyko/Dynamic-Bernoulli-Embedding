The activity of the intraerythrocytary enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione reductase and ATPase was measured before and after splenectomy in 13 patients with congenital hemolytic anemia and 3 patients suffering from chronic thrombocytopenia. All patients were treated successfully, as reflected by clinical and basal hematological parameters. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase were significantly depressed after splenectomy. It was not possible to set up prognostic criteria of splenectomy from the intraerythrocytary enzymes.
