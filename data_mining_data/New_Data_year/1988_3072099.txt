The complete nucleotide sequence of the Aspergillus nidulans pyruvate kinase gene, including its flanking sequences, is presented. The gene has a 1,578 bp coding sequence that encodes a protein of 526 amino acids; the latter is strongly homologous to the pyruvate kinases found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (66%) and mammals (53%). The gene is interrupted by seven introns, three of which are in a conserved position compared to those present in the mammalian pyruvate kinase genes sequenced thus far. A fourth intron within the mononucleotide binding fold domain is in a conserved position with respect to the position of an intron within the NAD+ binding region of maize ADH I. The transcription start site has been determined; a major site of transcription was found 80 bp before the translation initiation codon. The promoter region of the A. nidulans pyruvate kinase gene contains no direct homologies with the TATA or CCAAT sequences in the expected region (30-70 bp) before the transcription initiation site. However, extended CT-enriched regions are found in the promotor region, similar to what has been observed in genes that are highly expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and filamentous fungi.
