Perfused rat hearts show a markedly increased binding of phosphofructokinase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase as a consequence of ischaemia, but little change in binding of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. After 10 min ischaemia over one quarter of the phosphofructokinase and three quarters of the aldolase are bound. The effect of anoxia is less well marked in its influence on binding with only aldolase showing a significant increase in binding. These results suggest that one factor involved in the increased binding during ischaemia is the fall in pH of the heart. Binding studies with isolated myofibrils confirm that the affinity and stoichiometry of aldolase binding are considerably increased as the pH is lowered over a range comparable to that which occurs in ischaemic heart. The low level of binding of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in perfused rat hearts correlates with the relatively low affinity of this enzyme for binding to rat or rabbit cardiac myofibrils. There are species differences in the enzyme binding response to ischaemia. Sheep hearts show rapid and large increases in the binding of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in addition to changes in aldolase and phosphofructokinase binding. The greater binding of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reflects the greater affinity of sheep cardiac myofibrils. It is suggested that the altered metabolic demands of ischaemia are satisfied by changes in glycolytic enzyme organisation as the enzymes shift from the soluble to the particulate phase of cardiac muscle.
