In vitro effects of 2 water-soluble prednisolon-derivatives on 10 Candida albicans and 10 Candida tropicals species were investigated. Tests were performed during resting and proliferation phases. Changes of cell metabolism were measured by O2-consumption by the Warburg technique. With increasing corticosteroid concentrations (10-10000 gammaml) a dose dependent increase of cell respiration was found with and without addition of nutritive substrates. Even high concentrations of corticosteroid did not cause an antimetabolic effect. The tests did not yield different results for the two Candida species examined.
