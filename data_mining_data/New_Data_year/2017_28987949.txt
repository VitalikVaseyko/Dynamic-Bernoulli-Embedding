Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi), a type of Chinese materia medica, has been used to treat acute and chronic heart failure (HF) in traditional Chinese medicine and has been proven in numerous animal studies. It is also well-known that Zingiberis Rhizoma (Ganjiang) is ineffective in the treatment of HF, but it can enhance the anti-HF effect of Fuzi. However, the mechanism underlying this compatibility is still not well investigated. To investigate this mechanism, a model of acute heart failure (AHF) in SD rats induced by propafenone hydrochloride was established in this study. After oral treatments of Ganjiang, Fuzi or a combination of the two drugs in rats with AHF, heart function [e.g., heart rate (HR) and the maximal rising and declining rate of left ventricle pressure (+/-dp/dtmax)] and serum indicators [e.g., brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK)] were measured, and histopathological analysis of the heart was also performed. The biological mechanisms were further explored by measuring the protein expression level of the mitochondrial respiration chain complex (MRCC1-4) and the mRNA and protein expression levels of mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) and its upstream proteins, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter 1 and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter 2 (MICU1-2). The expression levels of key enzymes downstream of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), were also measured. As a result, Ganjiang enhanced the therapeutic effect of Fuzi on AHF by raising the HR and +/-dp/dtmax; decreasing the serum levels of BNP, LDH and CK; and alleviating histological damage of the myocardial tissue when compared to the treatments of Ganjiang or Fuzi alone. In conclusion, there was an enhancing effect of Ganjiang on the anti-AHF function of Fuzi treatment, and the potential mechanism of this effect may be related to the mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway mediated by MCU.
