The enzyme pyruvate kinase of Leishmania mexicana amazonensis presents two forms with different kinetic properties and behavior for the heterotrophic activator fructose 2,6 bisphosphate. Pyruvate kinase 1, which is isolated as a tetramer, is inhibited by this metabolite. The second activity, Pyruvate kinase 2, is activated by fructose 2,6 bisphosphate, which promotes the monomer-tetramer conversion of this enzyme.
