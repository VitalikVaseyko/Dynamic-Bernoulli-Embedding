The majority of cancer cells maintain a high glycolytic activity and an increased lactate production, even in a well oxygenated environment. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect. Previous studies have revealed that various types of cancer selectively express the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), and that PKM2 plays a pivotal role in the Warburg effect. Although elevated PKM2 levels have been observed in pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, little is known about the biological function of PKM2. In this study, in order to examine the expression and role of PKM2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we knocked down PKM2 in PDAC cells by introducing small interfering and short hairpin RNAs, and examined the gene expression profiles in the cells by microarray analysis. We analyzed the energy-producing pathways in the cells by XFe Extracellular Flux Analyzers, and detected intracellular metabolites by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that the RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKM2 diminished the proliferative, migratory and tumorigenic ability of the PDAC cell-lines. PKM2 knockdown also resulted in lower glycolytic activities and decreased levels of some intracellular metabolites, such as pyruvate and polyamine; however, it led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Microarray analysis revealed the functional association between PKM2 and the expression of genes that drive the cell cycle. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that PKM2 plays an important role in metabolic activities, as well as in the malignancy of PDAC cells.
