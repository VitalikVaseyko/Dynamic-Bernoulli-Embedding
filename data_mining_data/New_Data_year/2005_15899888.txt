The liver plays a central role in the control of blood glucose homeostasis by maintaining a balance between glucose production and utilization. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Hepatic FXR expression is regulated by glucose and insulin. Here we identify a role for FXR in the control of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. When submitted to a controlled fasting-refeeding schedule, FXR(-/-) mice displayed an accelerated response to high carbohydrate refeeding with an accelerated induction of glycolytic and lipogenic genes and a more pronounced repression of gluconeogenic genes. Plasma insulin and glucose levels were lower in FXR(-/-) mice upon refeeding the high-carbohydrate diet. These alterations were paralleled by decreased hepatic glycogen content. Hepatic insulin sensitivity was unchanged in FXR(-/-) mice. Treatment of isolated primary hepatocytes with a synthetic FXR agonist attenuated glucose-induced mRNA expression as well as promoter activity of L-type pyruvate kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, and Spot14. Moreover, activated FXR interfered negatively with the carbohydrate response elements regions. These results identify a novel role for FXR as a modulator of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.
