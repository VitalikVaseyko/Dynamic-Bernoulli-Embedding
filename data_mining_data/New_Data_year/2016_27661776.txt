The accelerated growth of solid tumors leads to episodes of both hypoxia and hypoglycemia (HH) affecting their intermediary metabolism, signal transduction, and transcriptional activity. A previous study showed that normoxia (20% O2 ) plus 24 h hypoglycemia (2.5 mM glucose) increased glycolytic flux whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) was unchanged versus normoglycemia in HeLa cells. However, the simultaneous effect of HH on energy metabolism has not been yet examined. Therefore, the effect of hypoxia (0.1-1% O2 ) plus hypoglycemia on the energy metabolism of HeLa cells was analyzed by evaluating protein content and activity, along with fluxes of both glycolysis and OxPhos. Under hypoxia, in which cell growth ceased and OxPhos enzyme activities, DeltaPsim and flux were depressed, hypoglycemia did not stimulate glycolytic flux despite increasing H-RAS, p-AMPK, GLUT1, GLUT3, and HKI levels, and further decreasing mitochondrial enzyme content. The impaired mitochondrial function in HH cells correlated with mitophagy activation. The depressed OxPhos and unchanged glycolysis pattern was also observed in quiescent cells from mature multicellular tumor spheroids, suggesting that these inner cell layers are similarly subjected to HH. The principal ATP supplier was glycolysis for HH 2D monolayer and 3D quiescent spheroid cells. Accordingly, the glycolytic inhibitors iodoacetate and gossypol were more effective than mitochondrial inhibitors in decreasing HH-cancer cell viability. Under HH, stem cell-, angiogenic-, and EMT-biomarkers, as well as glycoprotein-P content and invasiveness, were also enhanced. These observations indicate that HH cancer cells develop an attenuated Warburg and pronounced EMT- and invasive-phenotype. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 1346-1359, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
