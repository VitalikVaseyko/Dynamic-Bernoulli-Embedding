The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) is a key driver of glycolysis in cancer cells and has critical 'non-metabolic' functions in some cancers; however, the role of PKM2 in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the role of PKM2 in pancreatic cancer progression and the potential of PKM2 as a therapeutic target. In this study, we observed that PKM2 is highly expressed in patients with pancreatic cancer and is correlated to survival. Elevated PKM2 expression promoted cell proliferation, migration and tumor formation. The inhibition of cell growth by silencing PKM2 is caused by impairment of the autophagy process. To test the potential effects of downregulating PKM2 as a clinical therapy, we constructed an RGD-modified oncolytic adenovirus containing shPKM2 (O(Ad).R.shPKM2) to knock down PKM2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Cells transduced with O(Ad).R.shPKM2 exhibited decreased cell viability, and, in a PANC-1 xenograft model, intratumoral injection of O(Ad).R.shPKM2 resulted in reduced tumor growth. Furthermore, O(Ad).R.shPKM2 induced apoptosis and impaired autophagy in PANC-1 cells. Our results suggested that targeting PKM2 with an oncolytic adenovirus produced a strong antitumor effect, and that this strategy could broaden the therapeutic options for treating pancreatic cancer.
