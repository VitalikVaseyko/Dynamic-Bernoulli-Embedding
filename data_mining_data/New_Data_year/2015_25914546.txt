BACKGROUND: It is well known that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) plays an important role in tissue energy metabolism. However, the roles of PGC-1alpha in malignant endometrial cancer remain unknown. METHODS: Forty cases of endometrial carcinoma, 15 cases with proliferative endometrial tissues, and 21 cases with normal endometrial tissues were collected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha and estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma). ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was used to detect the concentrations of pyruvate kinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. The results were analyzed using medical statistical methods. RESULTS: The mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha and ERRgamma in the endometrial carcinoma tissues and hyperplasic endometrial tissues were significantly greater than those in the normal endometria. The mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha and ERRgamma in the endometrial carcinoma patients with type 2 diabetes were higher than those in patients without diabetes. The mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha and ERRgamma in the endometrial adenocarcinomas increased with clinical staging, depth of myometrial invasion, and increases in the number of metastatic lymph nodes. The PGC-1alpha mRNA level was positively correlated with ERRgamma in the endometrial carcinoma tissues. The mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha were positively correlated with the concentrations of pyruvate kinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase in the endometrial carcinoma tissues, and similar results were found for ERRgamma. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the upregulation of PGC-1alpha and ERRgamma in endometrial cancer might be a requirement for cancer cell energy metabolism, which contributes to the development of endometrial cancer.
