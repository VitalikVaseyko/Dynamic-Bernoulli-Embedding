The three distal transcriptional regulatory elements of the rat pyruvate kinase M gene, referred to as boxes A, B, and C, are located around -270 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional initiation site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with specific competitors and antibodies show that both box A and box B bind to Sp1 and Sp3 and that box C binds nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y). Luciferase reporter assays revealed that although box A and box B alone have no independent effect on luciferase activities, box C alone stimulates transcription. However, the inclusion of all three elements lead to maximal activity because of a synergistic effect, mainly between box B and box C, suggesting that functional synergism between Sp1/Sp3 and NF-Y is critical for the pyruvate kinase M (PKM) gene distal promoter activity. In fact, co-transfection of a dominant negative mutant of NF-YA (NF-YA29) resulted in a decrease in reporter activity in a box C-dependent manner. In addition, the overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 and NF-Y in Drosophila SL2 cells synergistically stimulated PKM gene distal promoter activity. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system in HeLa cells, it was shown that both Sp1 and Sp3 interacted with NF-YA but not NF-YB and NF-YC. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that only in vitro translated (35)S-labeled NF-YA interacted with both Sp1 and Sp3 in vitro. A subunit interaction domain of NF-YA, which forms a heterotrimer with NF-YB and NF-YC, is not required for these interactions with Sp1 or Sp3. Thus, we conclude that Sp1, Sp3, and NF-Y stimulate the transcription of the PKM gene via their interactions.
