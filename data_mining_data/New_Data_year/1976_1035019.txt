In human erythrocytes and Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, NaF inhibites aerobic glucose utilization and lactate formation. The inhibition of glycolysis was accompanied by a decrease in cellular pyruvate and ATP, and by accumulation of 2-hosphoenolpyruvate. These results and direct enzymatic determinations showed that fluoride inhibits, in addition to enolase (phosphopyruvate hydratase, EC 4.2.1.11), also pyruvate kinase.
