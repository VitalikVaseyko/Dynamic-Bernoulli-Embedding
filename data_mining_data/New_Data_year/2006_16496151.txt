Polysaccharide-linked hydroxycinnamoyl esters (PHEs) over-accumulate in the internodes of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutant, Fukei 71 (F71). This accumulation is accompanied by over-expression of phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL). In this study, we show that only one member of the 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) family expresses in close correlation with PAL. Furthermore, substrate availability to DAHPS is promoted by down-regulating the expression of plastidic pyruvate kinase (PKp), a competitor of DAHPS. Since the over-production of PHEs is caused by D50 gene disruption, these results suggest that specific enzymes in the phenylpropanoid and shikimate pathways are coordinately up-regulated. In addition, the results indicate that carbon-flow into the shikimate pathway is modified for the synthesis of PHEs, and is probably controlled by D50.
