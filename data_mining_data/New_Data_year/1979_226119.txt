We report the synthesis of adenosine [gamma-(S)-16O,17O,18O]triphosphate, an isotopically labeled species of ATP that is chiral at the gamma-phosphoryl group, the configuration of which has been confirmed by independent stereochemical analysis. This molecule has been used as a substrate in the reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase and by acetate kinase. The resulting samples of isotopically labeled sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and of acetyl phosphate have been used as substrates in the alkaline phosphatase mediated transfer of the chiral phosphoryl groups to (S)-propane-1,2-diol, whence the configuration at phosphorus has been determined [Abbott, S. J., Jones, S. R., Weinman, S. A., & Knowles, J. R. (1978) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100, 2558]. It is shown that glycerol kinase and acetate kinase (and, by virtue of an earlier correlation, pyruvate kinase and hexokinase) proceed by pathways that result in inversion of the configuration at phosphorus. The sterochemical approach provides an access to the otherwise cryptic events that are involved in phosphoryl-group transfer within the ternary complexes of these kinases and their substrates.
