Activities of phosphorylase, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase were studied in soluble fraction of cells from dissimilarly acting sceletal muscles of intact rabbits and from those tissues with impaired neural impulsation (denervation, experimental allergic neuritis). Activity of phosphorylase was found to be 2.2-fold higher and of hexokinase--4-fold lower in soluble fraction of quick muscle as compared with that of slow muscle. Due to denervation these differences were smoothed off. The same alterations in hexokinase activity were observed in muscles of rabbits with experimental allergic neuritis both after impairment of sensitive innervation and after denervation.
