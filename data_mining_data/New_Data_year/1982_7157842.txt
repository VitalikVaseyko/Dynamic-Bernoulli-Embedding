Acetobacter sp. MB 58 assimilates methanol via the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate variant of the hexulose phosphate pathway. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate originates as net product of an assimilation loop involving the regeneration of the C1-acceptor ribulose-5-phosphate and must be available for the de novo synthesis of the C1-acceptor as well as for the oxidative glycolysis. It is made probable in a regulatory model that this is accomplished via alternating anabolic and catabolic phases which are controlled by concerted action of PEP-carboxylase and pyruvate kinase. Whereas Ac-CoA is a crucial effector and alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate are inhibitors for the PEP-carboxylase, the pyruvate kinase is assumed to be regulated by energy charge.
