An earlier graph theoretical model of metabolic and gene-expression networks has been modified and extended to include the effect of electrical potentials on binding constants, representation of uncatalyzed processes, and treatment of parallel reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme. Formal operations on the graph, which are facilitated by a set of standardized guidelines, identify the feedback signals in the network and rank them according to their influence. The technique was applied to a model of glycolysis in ascites tumor cells in the absence and presence of 12.5 mM exogenous glucose. Feedback regulation was widely distributed and mostly due to binding of adenine nucleotide cofactors to the enzymes of the network. The major changes in feedback regulation on adding glucose is the relief of inhibition of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase and the activation of pyruvate kinase. We conclude that regulation of tumor cell glycolysis is not restricted to hexokinase or to (Na+,K+)-ATPase as was previously suggested by others.
