Plasma 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) concentration decreased significantly (P < 0.05), during 1-5 days of captivity, from levels in the freshly caught dogfish shark Squalus acanthias. The short-term effects of T3 treatment on the intermediary metabolism of S. acanthias were measured in the gill, kidney, liver, and white muscle. Animals were kept for 1-5 days before experimentation. Three hours after an intraperitoneal injection with either a low T3 dose (8.3 pmol T3/kg fish) or a high T3 dose (830 pmol T3/kg fish), selected enzymes of amino acid metabolism, lipid catabolism, ketone body metabolism, glycolysis, and oxidative metabolism were measured. Activity of enzymes of amino acid metabolism and lipid catabolism increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the liver of fish treated with a low T3 dose. The low dose of T3 apparently influences glycolysis as pyruvate kinase activity significantly increase (P < 0.05) in the kidney and white muscle.
