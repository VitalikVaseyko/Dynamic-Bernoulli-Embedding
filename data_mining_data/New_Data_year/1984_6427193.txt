High-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and 14C fluorography have been used to identify and quantitate intermediates of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway in intact cells and cell extracts of Streptococcus lactis. Glycolysing cells contained high levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (a positive effector of pyruvate kinase) but comparatively low concentrations of other glycolytic metabolites. By contrast, starved organisms contained only high levels of 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate. The concentration of Pi (a negative effector of pyruvate kinase) in starved cells was fourfold greater than that maintained by glycolysing cells. The following result suggest that retention of the phosphoenolpyruvate pool by starved cells is a consequence of Pi-mediated inhibition of pyruvate kinase: the increase in the phosphoenolpyruvate pool (and Pi) preceded depletion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and reduction in intracellular Pi (by a maltose-plus-arginine phosphate trap) caused the restoration of pyruvate kinase activity in starved cells. Time course studies showed that Pi was conserved by formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate during glycolysis. Conversely, during starvation high levels of Pi were generated concomitant with depletion of intracellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The concentrations of Pi and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate present in starved and glycolysing cells of S. lactis varied inversely. The activity of pyruvate kinase in the growing cell may be modulated by the relative concentrations of the two antagonistic effectors.
