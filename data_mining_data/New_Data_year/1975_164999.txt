A host response to infection by Coxiella burneti was investigated. Infectedyolk sacs were harvested from embryonated eggs and assayed for glycolytic activity. Assays of glycolytic enzymes included glucose isomerase, aldolase, phosphofructokinase,fructose-1,6-diphoshatase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase. No significant differences in enzymatic activity between normal and infected tissues through the 12th day was observed. From the 13th day through the 16thday, the glycolytic activity of normal tissues decreased. Glycolytic activity of infected tissues did not decrease, but showed a gradual increase during this same time period. Embryos from infected eggs demonstrated a gradual decrease in total weight fromthe 12th day until death occurred on the 16th day.
