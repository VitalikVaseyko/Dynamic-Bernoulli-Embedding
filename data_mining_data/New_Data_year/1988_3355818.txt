A latex phagocytosis technique was used to prepare relatively pure plasma membranes with inside-out orientation. This method was adapted through a number of modifications in order to evaluate the association of glycolytic enzymes with the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane of C6 glial cells. As phosphorylation is strictly coupled with transport in these cells, glycolytic enzymes, especially hexokinase, could metabolize glucose in close vicinity to its transporter. Of the enzymes tested, hexokinase is present in considerable quantities on these membranes (nearly 40% of homogenate specific activity), followed by D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (10%), pyruvate kinase (8%), and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (1%). Except for hexokinase, the enzyme pattern presented here is different from that published for other membrane preparations.
