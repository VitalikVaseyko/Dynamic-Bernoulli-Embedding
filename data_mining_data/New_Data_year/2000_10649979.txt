N'-methyl-N-(4-tert-butyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine)thiourea, SDZ048-619 (1), is a modest inhibitor (IC(50) = 180 microM) of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK). In an optimization of the N-methylcarbothioamide moiety of 1, it was discovered that amides with a small acyl group, in particular appropriately substituted amides of (R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic acid, are inhibitors of PDHK. Utilizing this acyl moiety, herein is reported the rationale leading to the optimization of a series of acylated piperazine derivatives. Methyl substitution of the piperazine at the 2- and 5-positions (with S and R absolute stereochemistry) markedly increased the potency of the lead compound (>1,000-fold). Oral bioavailability of the compounds in this series is good and is optimal (as measured by AUC) when the 4-position of the piperazine is substituted with an electron-poor benzoyl moiety. (+)-1-N-[2,5-(S, R)-Dimethyl-4-N-(4-cyanobenzoyl)piperazine]-(R)-3,3, 3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide (14e) inhibits PDHK in the primary enzymatic assay with an IC(50) of 16 +/- 2 nM, enhances the oxidation of [(14)C]lactate into (14)CO(2) in human fibroblasts with an EC(50) of 57 +/- 13 nM, diminishes lactate significantly 2.5 h post-oral-dose at doses as low as 1 micromol/kg, and increases the ex vivo activity of PDH in muscle, liver, and fat tissues in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. These PDHK inhibitors, however, do not lower glucose in diabetic animal models.
