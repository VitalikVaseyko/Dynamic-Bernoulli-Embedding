BACKGROUND: Recently we were able to demonstrate that Tumor M2 Pyruvate Kinase (Tumor M2-PK) is detectable in the feces of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. In this study an ELISA based on a different combination of antibodies was used to investigate stool samples of GI cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ELISA (ScheBoBiotech AG, Giessen, Germany) was based on one antibody specific for Tumor M2-PK and a second antibody reacting with Tumor M2-PK, M1-PK and the tetrameric M2-PK. Stool samples of healthy controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and different kinds of GI cancer were tested. RESULTS: Compared to controls, samples of IBD or different tumors did not show significant differences, except those patients with gastric cancer (elevated fecal PK in 80% (p = 0.005)). CONCLUSION: If the present results can be confirmed in larger patient samples, this new test might provide an excellent screening tool for gastric cancer.
