AIM: We investigated the effect of elevated plasma free fatty acid and insulin concentrations on PDK4 mRNA transcript and protein content and long-chain acyl-coenzyme A accumulation in human skeletal muscle. METHODS: On two occasions, 10 healthy men underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps for 6 h with (LIPID) and without (CON) iv Intralipid (20% at 90 ml/h) plus heparin (200 U prime + 600 U/h) infusion. RESULTS: Glucose disposal was approximately 50% lower at the end of the clamp in the LIPID compared with the CON trial (37.8 +/- 4.4 and 79.6 +/- 4.0 micromol/kg lean mass.min, respectively; P < 0.01). In the LIPID trial, muscle long-chain acyl-coenzyme A concentration increased after 6 h, but not 3 h of lipid infusion (P < 0.01). Muscle PDK4 mRNA, but not protein, was down-regulated by 2-fold within 3 h in both clamps and decreased further (6-fold; P < 0.01) at 6 h in the CON but not the LIPID clamp. The lipid-induced attenuation in the suppression of PDK4 gene expression was not dependent on the activation of the Akt/FOXO3 pathway. CONCLUSION: Accumulation of im lipids plays a more important role than impaired activation of Akt-mediated pathways in the regulation of muscle PDK4 gene expression in lipid-induced acute insulin-resistant states.
