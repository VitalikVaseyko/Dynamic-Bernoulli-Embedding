In order to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of blood glucose concentrations specific to chickens, carbohydrate metabolism in the liver, muscle and kidney and metabolite concentrations in the blood were investigated in chickens with acute and persistent hypoglycemia. Acute and persistent hypoglycemia were experimentally induced by a single injection of insulin (8 U/kg BW) or by continuous infusion of insulin (22.5 U/kg BW/day) for 4 days. Non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration in plasma and D-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) concentrations in liver and muscle increased in the acute hypoglycemia. Plasma NEFA concentration and 3HB concentration in the blood and liver were not changed at day 3 of persistent hypoglycemia, while 3HB concentration in the muscle was decreased. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in the liver tended to increase but PFK and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were unchanged in acute hypoglycemia. In persistent hypoglycemia, increase of hepatic PFK activity at day 1 in which it was reversed at day 3, and a small increase of muscle PK activity were observed, while PK and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities in the liver and kidney were not significantly changed. These results show that in the persistent hypoglycemic chickens, hepatic glycolysis transiently increases, which is followed by a small decrease, while glycolysis in muscles and gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney are not significantly changed.
