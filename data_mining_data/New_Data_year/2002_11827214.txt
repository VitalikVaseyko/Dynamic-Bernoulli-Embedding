The osmotolerant Zymomonas mobilis strain suc40, (containing plasmid pDS3154-inaZ), which is capable of producing simultaneously ethanol and ice nuclei protein, was cultivated in a chemically defined complete sucrose medium, as well as in a sugar beet molasses medium in continuous culture. The strain exhibited the normal Monod's relationship between biomass and dilution rate, and between growth substrate concentration and dilution rate. Specific activities of a number of enzymes that appear to control important steps in the metabolic flux of the Entner-Doudoroff and pyruvate decarboxylation pathways were investigated over a range of growth rates in steady state cultures. With the exception of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and gluconate kinase, all of the enzymes exhibited a very similar pattern for the wild type Z. mobilis CP4 and for the osmotolerant mutants, independent of the media used; the enzyme patterns remained relatively constant over the studied growth range. The specific activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was increased 2-fold by decreasing dilution rate in sugar beet molasses. The specific activity of gluconate kinase was 2-fold lower at medium growth rates compared with that at either low or high growth rates. Pyruvate kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities were significantly higher compared with those of the enzymes governing the early steps of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The present study, which was designed to determine the behaviour of important enzymes in sucrose metabolism of Z. mobilis suc40/pDS3154-inaZ grown in continuous culture showed that the microorganism required regulation of specific enzyme activities at the transcriptional level when sugar beet molasses were used as the growth medium.
