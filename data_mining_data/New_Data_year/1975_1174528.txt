1. In order to assess whether the potential ability of heart ventricular muscle and liver to metabolise substrates such as alanine, aspartate and lactate varies as the sheep matures and its nutrition changes, the activities of the following enzymes were determined in tissues of lambs obtained at varying intervals between 50 days after conception to 16 weeks after birth and in livers from adult pregnant ewes: lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP)(EC 4.1.1.32), malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) and citrate (si)-synthase (EC 4.1.3.7). 2. In the heart a most marked increase in alanine aminotransferase activity was found throughout development. During this period the activities of citrate (si)-synthase, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase also increased. There were no substantial changes in the activities of aspartate aminotransferase, malate dehydrogenase or pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase activities were five times greater in the heart compared with those found in the liver. No significant activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) was detected in heart muscle. 3. In the liver the activities of both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase increased immediately following birth although the activity of alanine aminotransferase was lower in livers of pregnant ewes than in any of the lambs. As with alanine aminotransferase the highest activities of lactate dehydrogenase were found during the period of postnatal growth. No marked changes were observed in malate dehydrogenase or citrate (si)-synthase activities during development. A small decline in pyruvate kinase activity occurred whilst the activities of pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) tended to rise during development.
