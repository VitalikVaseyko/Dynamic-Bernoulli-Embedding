Tumor microenvironment is closely related to tumor progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are specialized fibroblasts domesticated by cancer cells surrounding them. CAFs are one of the most important components in cancer microenvironment. CAFs extensively involved in tumor genesis, tumor invasion and metastasis. Compared to NFs, CAFs also have a different metabolism type. CAFs use glycolysis to produce lactate for cancer cells. That is, CAFs turn to a metabolism type named "reverse Warburg effect" to promote tumor progression. In the present study, we summarized that: (1) Characteristics and metabolic type of CAFs; (2) The research status of the metabolism of CAFs; (3) The potential mechanism of CAFs metabolism; (4) The relation between metabolic alteration in CAFs and lung cancer progression; (5) Relationship between CAFs metabolism and lung cancer prognosis and therapy.
