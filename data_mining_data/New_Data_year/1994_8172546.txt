Subclinical nutritional myopathy was induced in 5-month-old sheep by feeding them a diet low in vitamin E and selenium. Subsequently clinical myopathy was induced by dosing with protected polyunsaturated fatty acids. Plasma activities of creatine kinase (CK), pyruvate kinase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase and aldolase, enzymes of muscle origin, all remained above their reference ranges in clinically affected sheep, but fluctuated widely. Similar fluctuations occurred in subclinically affected animals, resulting in some activities being within the reference ranges and some above, at different times. Plasma malondialdehyde, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, proved of no diagnostic value. Terminal plasma CK activities were significantly correlated with microscopic damage in the vastus lateralis (VL), but not the vastus intermedius (VI) or the tensor fascia lata (TFL) muscles. AST was the most highly correlated with damage in VI and VL. In two clinically affected sheep successfully treated with an oral dose of alpha-tocopherol acetate all enzymes decreased steadily to within their reference ranges, at rates probably related to their plasma half-lives. These results suggest that measurement of plasma CK activity would be useful in monitoring recovery of treated sheep.
