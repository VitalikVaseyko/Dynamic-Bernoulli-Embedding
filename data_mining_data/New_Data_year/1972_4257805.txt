Previous studies have shown a marked effect of very high levels of copper on red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione. When the effect of more nearly physiological levels of copper were studied, red cell hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglyceric kinase, pyruvate kinase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were found to be inhibited. Inhibition was observed both when copper was added directly to hemolysates or when hemolysates were prepared from red cells from whole blood which had been incubated with copper and washed. The inhibition of red cell enzymes by copper was completely reversed by the addition of EDTA.
