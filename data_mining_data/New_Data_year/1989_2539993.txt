Glycolytic activity of five brain areas in the rat was studied under two hypothyroid states: (1) induced by low-iodine diet from weaning, and (2) induced by propylthiouracil. The areas studied were the anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, septum and hippocampus. A low-iodine diet induced a decrease of pyruvate kinase activity in three region and of phosphofructokinase in the hippocampus, while hexokinase increased in both the amygdala and septum. Propylthiouracil treatment produced an increase in hexokinase activity in the hypothalamus and septum, and a decrease in the anterior cortex, while phosphofructokinase decreased significantly in the hippocampus. No significant changes of lactate dehydrogenase activity were observed. The correlation between the results and type of hypothyroidism is discussed.
