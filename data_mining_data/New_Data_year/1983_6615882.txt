A one step procedure is presented for the preparation of [32P]phosphoenolpyruvate from [gamma-32P]ATP using pyruvate kinase. The reaction is carried out at chemical equilibrium and involves only an exchange of isotope between ATP and phosphoenolpyruvate. The initial phosphoenolpyruvate/ATP ratio in the reaction mixture determines the degree of 32P incorporation into phosphoenolpyruvate when isotopic equilibrium is achieved.
