Regulation of the glycolytic pathway is considered to be primarily achieved by the carbon metabolites resulting from glucose metabolism [e.g., fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and citrate] and by the ATP charge of the cell. The divalent cations (e.g., Mg2+ and Mn2+) have not been considered as having regulatory roles in glycolysis, although they are involved in almost every enzyme-catalyzed reaction in the pathway. Using a kinetic linked-function analysis of steady-state kinetic data for the interactions of PEP, FDP, and Mn2+ with yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK), we have found that the divalent metal is the principal trigger of the allosteric responses observed with this enzyme. The interaction of Mn2+ to YPK enhances the interaction of FDP by -1.6 kcal/mol and the interaction of PEP by -2.8 kcal/mol. The simultaneous interaction of all three of these ligands to YPK is favored by -4.3 kcal/mol over the sum of their independent binding free energies. Surprisingly, the binding of the allosteric activator FDP does not directly influence the binding of the substrate PEP since a coupling free energy near zero was calculated for these two ligands. Thus, communication between the PEP and FDP sites occurs structurally through the metal by an allosteric relay mechanism. These conclusions are supported by results of a thermodynamic linked-function analysis of direct binding data for the interactions of PEP, FDP, and Mn2+ with YPK [Mesecar, A. D., & Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry (following paper in this series)]. Our findings raise important questions as to the possible roles of divalent metals in modulating multiligand interactions with YPK and in the regulation of the glycolytic pathway.
