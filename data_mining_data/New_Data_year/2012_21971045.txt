3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Although binding of 3'-phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PDK1 is known to be essential for its interaction with and activation of downstream kinases, the mechanism by which PDK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane remains controversial. Our surface plasmon resonance analysis of the PDK1 PH domain and selected mutants shows that the PH domain specifically binds phosphatidylserine using a site that is separate from the canonical phosphoinositide-binding site. Further cell studies show that this specific phosphatidylserine binding is important for the plasma membrane localization and signaling function of PDK1.
