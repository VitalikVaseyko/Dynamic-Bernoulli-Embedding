BACKGROUND/AIM: Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by fumarate hydratase (FH) gene mutation. It is associated with the development of very aggressive kidney tumors, characterized by early onset and high metastatic potential, and has no effective therapy. The aim of the study was to establish a new preclinical platform for investigating morphogenetic and metabolic features, and alternative therapy of metastatic hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma type 2 (PRCC2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh cells were collected from pleural fluid of a patient with metastatic hereditary PRCC2. Morphogenetic and functional characteristics were evaluated via microscopy, FH gene sequencing analysis, real-time polymerase chaine reaction and enzymatic activity measurement. We performed bioenergetic analysis, gene-expression profiling, and cell viability assay with 19 anti-neoplastic drugs. RESULTS: We established a new in vitro model of hereditary PRCC2 - the NCCFH1 cell line. The cell line possesses a c.1162 delA - p.Thr375fs frameshift mutation in the FH gene. Our findings indicate severe attenuation of oxidative phosphorylation and glucose-dependent growth of NCCFH1 cells that is consistent with the Warburg effect. Furthermore, gene-expression profiling identified that the most prominent molecular features reflected a high level of apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cell signaling. Drug screening revealed a marked sensitivity of FH(-/-) cells to mitoxantrone, epirubicin, topotecan and a high sensitivity to bortezomib. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the NCCFH1 cell line is a very interesting preclinical model for studying the metabolic features and testing new therapies for hereditary PRCC2, while bortezomib may be a potential efficient therapeutic option.
