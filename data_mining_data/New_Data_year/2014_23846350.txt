The biochemical events involved in the upregulation of selected glucoseresponsive genes by 3OmethylDglucose (3MG) remain to be elucidated. The present study mainly aimed to reevaluate the possible role of 3MG phosphorylation in the upregulation of the thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) and liver pyruvate kinase (LPK) genes in rat hepatocytes and INS1E cells. TXNIP and LPK transcription was assessed in rat liver and INS1E cells exposed to a rise in Dglucose concentration, 2deoxyDglucose (2DG), 3MG and, when required, Dmannoheptulose. The phosphorylation of D[U14C]glucose and 3O[14C]methylDglucose (14C-labeled 3-MG) was measured in rat liver, INS1E cell and rat pancreatic islet homogenates. The utilization of D[53H]glucose by intact INS1E cells was also measured. In rat hepatocytes, a rise in the Dglucose concentration increased the TXNIP/hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and LPK/HPRT ratios, while 2DG and 3MG also increased the TXNIP/HPRT ratio, but not the LPK/HPRT ratio. In INS1E cells, the TXNIP/HPRT and LPK/HPRT ratios were increased in response to the addition of Dglucose, 2DG and 3MG. Furthermore, Dmannoheptulose abolished the response to Dglucose and 2DG, but not to 3MG, in these cells. Liver cell homogenates catalyzed the phosphorylation of 3MG to a modest extent, whilst INS1E and rat pancreatic islet cell homogenates did not. Moreover, 3MG marginally decreased Dglucose phosphorylation in INS1E cell homogenates but not in liver cell homogenates. D[53H]glucose utilization by intact INS1E cells was decreased by 2DG, but not by 3MG. These findings reinforce the view that the upregulation of the TXNIP and LPK genes induced by 3MG is not attributable to its phosphorylation or any favorable effect on Dglucose metabolism.
