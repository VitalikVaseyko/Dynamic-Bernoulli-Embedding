In the present study the mechanism of action of M2-type pyruvate kinase from human meningioma in the simultaneous presence of fructose 1,6 diphosphate and L-alanine was investigated. Purified pyruvate kinase from human meningioma was allosterically inhibited by L-alanine with respect to substrates phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP. The inhibitory effects of L-alanine was partially removed by fructose 1,6 diphosphate. The purified enzyme was slightly susceptible to ATP inhibition.
