1. Rats were fed with diets containing orotic acid with dietary fibers to induce alteration of lipid metabolism and cytoplasmic enzyme activities in the livers. Concentrations of blood glucose, serum insulin and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured. 2. In CP (cellulose + orotic acid) group compared to basal (cellulose - orotic acid) or CBH (corn bran hemicellulose + cellulose + orotic acid) groups, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and ATP citrate lyase activities and FFA concentration were decreased according to lipid accumulation of livers. 3. In the CBH group, glycerokinase activity was higher than basal group.
