Sugar consumption and subsequent sugar metabolism are known to regulate the expression of genes involved in intestinal sugar absorption and delivery. Here we investigate the hypothesis that sugar-sensing detectors in membranes facing the intestinal lumen or the bloodstream can also modulate intestinal sugar absorption. We used wild-type and GLUT2-null mice, to show that dietary sugars stimulate the expression of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) by GLUT2-dependent mechanisms, whereas the expression of GLUT5 and SGLT1, did not rely on the presence of GLUT2. By providing sugar metabolites, sugar transporters, including GLUT2, fuelled a sensing pathway. In Caco2/TC7 enterocytes, we could disconnect the sensing triggered by detector from that produced by metabolism, and found that GLUT2 generated a metabolism-independent pathway to stimulate the expression of SI and L-PK. In cultured enterocytes, both apical and basolateral fructose could increase the expression of GLUT5, conversely, basolateral sugar administration could stimulate the expression of GLUT2. Finally, we located the sweet-taste receptors T1R3 and T1R2 in plasma membranes, and we measured their cognate G alpha Gustducin mRNA levels. Furthermore, we showed that a T1R3 inhibitor altered the fructose-induced expression of SGLT1, GLUT5, and L-PK. Intestinal gene expression is thus controlled by a combination of at least three sugar-signaling pathways triggered by sugar metabolites and membrane sugar receptors that, according to membrane location, determine sugar-sensing polarity. This provides a rationale for how intestine adapts sugar delivery to blood and dietary sugar provision.
