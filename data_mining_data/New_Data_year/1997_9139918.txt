We have characterized the gene YOR347c of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown that it encodes a second functional pyruvate kinase isoenzyme, Pyk2p. Overexpression of the YOR347c/PYK2 gene on a multicopy vector restored growth on glucose of a yeast pyruvate kinase 1 (pyk1) mutant strain and could completely substitute for the PYK1-encoded enzymatic activity. PYK2 gene expression is subject to glucose repression. A pyk2 deletion mutant had no obvious growth phenotypes under various conditions, but the growth defects of a pyk1 pyk2 double-deletion strain were even more pronounced than those of a pyk1 single-mutation strain. Pyk2p is active without fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. However, overexpression of PYK2 during growth on ethanol did not cause any of the deleterious effects expected from a futile cycling between pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate. The results indicate that the PYK2-encoded pyruvate kinase may be used under conditions of very low glycolytic flux.
