Enzyme activity of lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate-oxalacetate and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, creatine phosphokinase, cholinesterase, alkaline, acid and prostatic phosphatase and aldolase has been studied in a total of 213 subjects, of whom 97 were of good health, 63 had bone tumors and 53 suffered from osteomyelitis. The activities of the majority of the enzymes were found to become significantly changed in comparison with the norm. In both patient groups, the more striking differences being noted in that of osteomyelitis. However, enzymatic activity alone does not allow to differentiate the group of bone tumors from that of osteomyelitis, the differences between these two groups not being of significance in any one of the enzymes followed.
