Viruses accomplish their replication by exploiting many cellular resources, including metabolites and energy. Similarly to other (+)RNA viruses, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) induces major changes in infected cells. However, the source of energy required to fuel TBSV replication is unknown. We find that TBSV co-opts the cellular glycolytic ATP-generating pyruvate kinase (PK) directly into the viral replicase complex to boost progeny RNA synthesis. The co-opted PK generates high levels of ATP within the viral replication compartment at the expense of a reduction in cytosolic ATP pools. The ATP generated by the co-opted PK is used to promote the helicase activity of recruited cellular DEAD-box helicases, which are involved in the production of excess viral (+)RNA progeny. Altogether, recruitment of PK and local production of ATP within the replication compartment allow the virus replication machinery an access to plentiful ATP, facilitating robust virus replication.
