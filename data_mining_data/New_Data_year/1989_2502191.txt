Pyruvate kinase modulation by L-alanine and L-phenylalanine was studied in cells obtained from in vitro culture of GM-CFC at different stages of development. L-Alanine and L-phenylalanine exhibit different inhibition behaviour at both differentiation stages and at various PEP concentration ranges. Therefore, a change in PK expression during granulocyte-macrophage development is suggested.
