Red cells glycolytic enzymes attached and nonattached to K88+ Escherichia coli were assayed. Hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activities, were measured. E. coli with K88ab fimbriae, E. coli with K88ac fimbriae, and isolated K88ab fimbriae were investigated for their effect on the above enzymes. Different changes were obtained with K88ab + bacteria compared with K88ac + bacteria. Purified fimbriae gave a third set of responses.
