1. Pigeon erythrocyte was found to depend on the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway for most of its energy production in the form of adenosine triphosphate and reducing potential, since there was no detectable activity of any of the citric acid cycle (TCA) cycle enzymes measured. 2. The absence of detectable amounts of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2-3-DPG) indicated that there is no direct relationship between the active glycolytic system and the function of these cells. 3. A comparison of the mass action ratios with the equilibrium constants of the glycolytic reactions showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase reactions are displaced from equilibrium, implying that these are the key regulatory enzymes of glycolysis in pigeon erythrocytes. 4. The changes in the concentrations of the glycolytic metabolites under hypoxic conditions that stimulate the flux through the glycolytic pathway were found to be consistent with the above hypothesis. 5. Flux measurements of the pentose phosphate pathway showed that it metabolizes only 3.4% of the total glucose consumed by the resting erythrocyte. 6. Hypoxic conditions resulted in a stimulation of the pentose phosphate pathway by as much as four-fold, whilst the glycolytic pathway was not stimulated by more than about twice.
