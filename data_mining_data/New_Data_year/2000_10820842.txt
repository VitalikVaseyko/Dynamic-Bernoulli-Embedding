The effects of vitamin D3 (as an ingredient of the preparation "Videchol") on the activity of some glycolysis enzymes (lactic dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase PK; hexokinase HK) and of pentose phosphate shunt (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), and also on the changes of metabolites concentration levels: ATP, NAD+, pyruvate and lactate following the administration of the vitamin to the control group rats and animals irradiated by low rate ionizing radiation were established. "Videchol" administration leads to the of LDH activity decrease within 10 days, of HK activity within 20 days and to the decrease of PK activity within 5 and 20 days after the experiment beginning. In the low dose radiation conditions a reconnection of carbohydrates' metabolism from glycolisys into pentose phosphate pathway in the erythrocytes was observed. The administration of vitamin D3 as a component of the preparation "Videchol" following the low rate radiation background facilitates the normalization of LDG, PK and HK activities in comparison with the same parameters of only irradiated rats. The studies on LDH--reaction kinetics showed the redistribution of the LDH isozymes pattern with different K(m) means for pyruvate in the rats subjected to the joint action of low dose chronical radiation and "Videchol" occurred.
