In order to ascertain whether mammalian mitochondria possess their own pyruvate kinase, we isolated mitochondria from liver of Large White pig and investigated pyruvate kinase occurrence both via immunological analysis and by assaying photometrically the pyruvate kinase reaction. We show that mitochondria contain pyruvate kinase located in the inner compartments; the pyruvate kinase reaction shows hyperbolic dependence on the substrate concentration, is inhibited by malonate and shows maximum activity at pH between 7-7.6 and Ea equal to 33 kJ/mol.
