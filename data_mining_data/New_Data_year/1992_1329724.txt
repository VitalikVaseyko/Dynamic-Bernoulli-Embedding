Levels of mRNA for glucokinase, L-pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were analysed during liver regeneration. Levels of mRNA for glycolytic enzymes (glucokinase and L-pyruvate kinase) decreased rapidly after partial hepatectomy. Glucokinase mRNA increased at 16-24 h, returning to normal values after this time. L-pyruvate kinase mRNA recovered control levels at 168 h. In contrast, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA increased rapidly after liver resection and remained high during the regenerative process. However, the levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase mRNA were not modified significantly. These results correlate with the reported increased rate of gluconeogenesis and changes in enzyme levels after partial hepatectomy. The effect of stress on the mRNA levels was also studied. All enzymes showed variations in their mRNA levels after the surgical stress. In general, the differences were more pronounced in regenerating liver than in sham-operated animals, being practically normalized at 24 h.
