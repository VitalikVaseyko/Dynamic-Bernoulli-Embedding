Depolymerization of microtubules in the ATP-reassembly buffer permitted the preparation of GDPETNGTP. Incubation of this tubulin fraction at 35 degrees with ATP induced the phosphorylation of E-site GDP into GTP, which was then dephosphorylated during microtubule assembly. Incubation of GDPETNGTP with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] also induced polymerization. Depolymerization of microtubules in the GTP-reassembly buffer yielded GTPETNGTP, which was capable of polymerizing into microtubules even in the absence of free GTP. In the presence of 4 M glycerol, GDPETNGTP assembled into microtubules with no change in the bound nucleotides.
