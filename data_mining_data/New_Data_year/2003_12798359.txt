The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) plays a key role in regulating fatty acid metabolism by regulating expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. To identify endogenous transcripts that could be used as surrogate markers for on-target activity of PPARalpha agonists, we employed a global profiling approach using DNA microarrays. The HK-2 cell line derived from proximal tubules of the human kidney, showed induction of several genes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK-4) and adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) by PPARalpha ligands. HK-2 cells express detectable levels of PPARalpha and its dimerization partner the retinoid X receptor (RXRalpha) proteins. Induction of PDK-4 in these cells correlates with induction of PDK-4 in the liver of fat-fed hamsters. The magnitude of fibrate induction of PDK-4 in the liver also mirrors the decrease in serum triglyceride levels. Thus, induction of PDK-4 by PPARalpha agonists in the HK-2 cell model closely correlates with its induction in vivo and may represent an early marker for PPARalpha agonist action.
