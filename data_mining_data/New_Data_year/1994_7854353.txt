Diabetes in rats is characterized by insulin deficiency accompanied by a decrease in lipogenic enzymes. The malic enzyme (ME) gene, which encodes an important lipogenic enzyme, was used to investigate insulin regulation of gene expression. ME mRNA levels were reduced by more than 90% in the liver of diabetic rats. The administration of insulin (3 U/15 days) to either control or diabetic rats increased ME mRNA by 2- to 10-fold, respectively. Since diabetes reduces circulating T3 and the levels of nuclear T3-receptors, the potential role of thyroid hormone on insulin regulation of ME gene expression was also evaluated in thyroidectomized-diabetic rats. In these animals the levels of ME mRNA were undetectable but were increased by insulin even in the absence of thyroid hormones. These in vivo effects of insulin and T3 were not additive. The transcription rate of the gene was also reduced in the diabetic liver and recovered after insulin therapy. By computer analyses we have identified two different putative insulin response elements (IREs) in the ME gene promoter, hereafter referred to as IRE-I (-683 to -692), which is similar to the phosphoenol pyruvate carboxy kinase promoter IRE and IRE-II (-161 to -170), which is similar to the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter IRE-A. Results from gel retardation assays suggest that a single nuclear protein binds to IRE-I whereas two different nuclear proteins bind to IRE-II. The protein/IRE-I complex increased in liver nuclear extracts from diabetic rats and decreased after insulin administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
