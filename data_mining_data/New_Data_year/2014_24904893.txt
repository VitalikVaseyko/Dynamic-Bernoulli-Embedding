Metabolic aberrations in the form of altered flux through key metabolic pathways are the major hallmarks of several life-threatening malignancies including malignant gliomas. These adaptations play an important role in the enhancement of the survival and proliferation of gliomas at the expense of the surrounding normal/healthy tissues. Recent studies in the field of neurooncology have directly targeted the altered metabolic pathways of malignant tumor cells for the development of anti-cancer drugs. Aerobic glycolysis due to elevated production of lactate from pyruvate regardless of oxygen availability is a common metabolic alteration in most malignancies. Aerobic glycolysis offers survival advantages in addition to generating substrates such as fatty acids, amino acids and nucleotides required for the rapid proliferation of cells. This review outlines the role of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) in gliomas as an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. An in-depth investigation on the key metabolic enzyme PDK may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas.
