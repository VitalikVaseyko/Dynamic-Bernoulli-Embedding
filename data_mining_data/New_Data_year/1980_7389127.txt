A continuous-flow system is described that utilizes an immobilized glycerol dehydrogenase nylon-tube reactor integrated into the flow system of a Technicon AutoAnalyzer II for the routine estimation of glycerol in serum and various beverages. Results are compared with determinations made by the solution method that uses the three enzymes glycerokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. These routine trials give reliable and reproducible results with high precision and economy. The glycerol dehydrogenase reactor is stable during intermittent or continuous use for a least 3500 tests. Stored at 4 degrees C when not in use, the reactor is quite stable for several months.
