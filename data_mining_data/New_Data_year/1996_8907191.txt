Previous studies have suggested that some glycolytic intermediates are involved in the regulation of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression by carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose. To find such intermediates, we examined the relationship between the levels of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA and glycolytic metabolites in hepatocytes cultured under various conditions. Of the metabolites, the levels of 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenol-pyruvate only increased significantly under conditions under which the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene was stimulated. The level of glucose 6-phosphate, which was reported to be involved in dietary stimulation of this gene expression, was not correlated with the mRNA level since marked accumulation of deoxyglucose 6-phosphate occurring on the addition of deoxyglucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog, was not accompanied by an increase in the L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA level. In addition, we found that fructose at a low concentration in the presence of glucose failed to increase the mRNA and metabolite levels in contrast to other reports that the promoter activity of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene is stimulated by this treatment. Thus we propose that 3-phosphoglycerate and/or phosphoenolpyruvate are involved in the carbohydrate regulation of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression.
