AMP is converted to ATP by incubating overnight with pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate and adenylate kinase in the presence of endogenous ATP (ADP) as primer. In a subsequent incubation in the presence of pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, radioactive glucose and hexokinase, ATP and ADP are estimated together by coupling their recycling to the formation of glucose 6-phosphate. The latter is separated by precipitation using 76% (v/v) acetone for radioactivity measurement in the same Eppendorf tube. The sensitivity of these simple procedures matches or exceeds those of luciferase methods of nucleotide determination.
