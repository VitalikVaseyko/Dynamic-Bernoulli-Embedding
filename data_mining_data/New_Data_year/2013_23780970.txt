The majority of human tumors display a high rate of glycolysis under aerobic conditions. This phenomenon was recognized approximately seven decades ago and is known as the Warburg effect. Several key enzymes required to maintain this high level of glucose metabolism are found in tumor cells. The effects of the glycolytic enzymes are known to be directly or indirectly regulated by various signaling pathways, oncogenes, suppressor genes and transcription factors. Recent molecular biology studies have shown that multiple genetic alterations are related to tumor development. Therefore, these factors may be rational targets for cancer therapy. In this short review, we describe several important molecules that affect aerobic glycolysis and discuss their possible use as therapeutic targets for cancer.
