The influence of ochratoxin A on enzyme activities and on the content of free adenine nucleotides and intermediates of glycolysis in rat lenses was investigated. For a period of eight weeks, five times weekly, albino Wistat rats received ochratoxin A in 0.1% NaHCO3, dosed 1/100 LD50, via stomach tube. All measurements were made at the end of the experiment. Decreased contents of ATP, G-6-P, sum of fructose, and F-6-P were observed, but pyruvic acid, AMP, and DAP increased. Relatively decreased activities of enzymes MDH, ALD, HK, GK, and PK were established. The influence of ochratoxin A on the carbohydrate metabolism of rat lenses with respect to tranparency is discussed. There were no significant differences in absolute lens weight in animals treated by ochratoxin A and controls.
