The economic coefficient, the growth rate, the quantitative content of bound amino acids, and the activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphorylase, malate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were studied comparatively in the haploid and diploid strains of Pichia pinus in the process of their growth in a medium containing glucose. An increase in the content of DNA in the cells was found to be accompanied with an increase of the specific growth rate at the exponential phase of growth and an increase in the activities of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; however, it had virtually no effect on the economic coefficient, the amino acid composition of protein, and the activities of pyruvate kinase and malate dehydrogenase.
