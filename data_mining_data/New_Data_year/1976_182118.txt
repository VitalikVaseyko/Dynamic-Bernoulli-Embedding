2-Phosphotartronate has been synthesized by permanganate oxidation of glycerol 2-phosphate and has been tested as an inhibitor of five glycolytic enzymes that bind phosphoglycerate or phosphoglycollate. Competitive inhibition of rabbit muscle phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase and pyruvate kinase was observed. Triose phosphate isomerase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase were not inhibited.
