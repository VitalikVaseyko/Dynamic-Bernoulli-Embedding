Oxalic, succinic, glutaric and pimelic acid (5 mM) had no effect on lactate formation from glucose if added to a crude extract of chicken embryo at the same time as substrate and cofactors; conversely malonic, adipic, suberic, azelaic and sebacic acid had an inhibitory effect ranging from 20% to 35%. When the enzyme preparation was pre-incubated with the dicarboxylic acids for one hour before beginning the experiments, all compounds tested, with the exception of succinate, inhibited anaerobic glycolysis. Hexokinase activity was significantly reduced by saturated dicarboxylic acids from C3 to C10, but not by oxalic acid. Phosphofructokinase was inhibited only by oxalic, pimelic and suberic acid. Pyruvate kinase appeared sensitive only to oxalic acid (64% inhibition).
