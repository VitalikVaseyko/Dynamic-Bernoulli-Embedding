In a previous phylogenetic study of the family of pyruvate kinase EC (2.7.1.40), a cluster with Glu117 and another with Lys117 were found (numbered according to the rabbit muscle enzyme). The sequences with Glu117 have been found to be K+-dependent, whereas those with Lys117 were K+-independent. Interestingly, only gamma-proteobacteria exhibit sequences in both branches of the tree. In this context, it was explored whether these phylogenetically distinct pyruvate kinases were both expressed and contribute to the pyruvate kinase activity in Vibrio cholerae. The main findings of this work showed that the isozyme with Glu117 is an active K+-dependent enzyme. At the same substrate concentration, its Vmax in the absence of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate was 80% of that with its effector. This result is in accordance with the non-essential activation described by allosteric ligands for most pyruvate kinases. In contrast, the pyruvate kinase with Lys117 was a K+-independent enzyme displaying an allosteric activation by ribose 5-phosphate. At the same substrate concentration, its activity without the effector was 0.5% of the one obtained in the presence of ribose 5-phosphate, indicating that this sugar monophosphate is a strong activator of this enzyme. This absolute allosteric dependence is a novel feature of pyruvate kinase activity. Interestingly, in the K+-independent enzyme, Mn2+ may "mimic" the allosteric effect of Rib 5-P. Despite their different allosteric behavior, both isozymes display a rapid equilibrium random order kinetic mechanism. The intracellular concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ribose 5-phosphate in Vibrio cholerae have been experimentally verified to be sufficient to induce maximal activation of both enzymes. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that both enzymes were co-expressed. Therefore, it is concluded that VcIPK and VcIIPK contribute to the activity of pyruvate kinase in this gamma-proteobacterium.
