A mathematical model that includes biochemical interactions among the PTS system, phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) is used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the glycolytic pathway of Escherichia coli under steady-state conditions. The influence of ADP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) on the dynamic regulation of this pathway is also analyzed. The model shows that the dynamic behavior of the system is affected significantly depending on whether ADP, PEP, or F6P is considered constant a steady state. Sustained oscillations are observed only when dADP/dt not equal 0 and completely suppressed if dADP/dt = 0 at any steady-state value. However, when PEP or F6P is constant, the system evolves toward the formation of stable limit cycles with periods ranging from 0.2 min to hours.
