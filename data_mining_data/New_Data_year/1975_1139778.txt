A patient with an erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity of 50% of the normal value and an abnormal pyruvate kinase (PK) was given 36 mg riboflavin daily for 6 months. The glutathione reductase activity was restored and the abnormal pyruvate kinase was converted to normal. The clinical state of the patient improved. It can be concluded that the abnormality of PK, at least with this patient, is a secondary effect. Therefore, it is suggested that other abnormalities be searched for when an altered PK is detected. Treatment of this abnormality will help the patients more efficiently.
