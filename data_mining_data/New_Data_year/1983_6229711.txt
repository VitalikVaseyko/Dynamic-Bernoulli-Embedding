The present study compares the time courses of the early changes in parvalbumin content, in the properties of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and in activity and isozyme patterns of metabolic enzymes in chronically (12 h/day) stimulated fast twitch tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the rabbit. Under the chosen conditions of stimulation, the first significant changes appeared after 6 days. Except for the delayed reduction in pyruvate kinase, the time course of the changes were the same. After 14 days of stimulation, parvalbumin decreased to 37% and Ca2+-ATPase activity of the SR to 29% of normal values. The transformation of the SR was also reflected by a 64% decrease of the 115000-Mr Ca2+-pumping peptide and a 5-fold increase in a 30000-Mr peptide. Following an identical time course, the mitochondrial activities of citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and ketoacid-CoA transferase increased 2.9, 3.0 and 3.7-fold respectively. A similar time course was observed in the M to H-type transition of the lactate dehydrogenase isozymes. The cause of these changes is discussed as it relates to altered transcriptional and/or translational activities. It is suggested that an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ caused by increased contractile activity, which is then perpetuated by the decrease in Ca2+-binding and sequestering capacities, might be the signal for such altered synthetic activities.
