1. Six monoclonal antibodies specific to the pyruvate kinase from the foot muscle of the common limpet P. caerulea were produced. 2. They also exhibited specificity against the mouse liver where the L-type isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase is present. They did not react with the mouse skeletal muscle, heart or red blood cells isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase (PK). One of these, the monoclonal antibody B did not react with any PK isoenzymes of the mouse tissues. 3. The presence of the isoenzymic type of PK which was recognized by the monoclonals, (type L), was traced in five phyla of marine invertebrates by the application of the monoclonal antibodies A, B and C. 4. In two phyla the majority of the animals were found to possess an L-type PK isoenzyme in their muscles while in quite a few of them a different isoenzymic type was present in the other tissues. The results of this study are compared with the existing literature, and the use of monoclonal antibodies in the study of enzymic systems is considered in the discussion.
