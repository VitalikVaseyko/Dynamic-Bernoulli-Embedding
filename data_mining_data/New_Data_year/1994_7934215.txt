The activities and interactions with cellular structure of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase have been studied in the major tissues of the guinea pig during development. The extent of activity variation in these tissues is described along with the putative physiological determinants of these alterations in activity. As to binding, overall the present data provide a firm indication that the extent of enzyme-structure interactions is appreciable at all ontogenic stages, and when viewed in conjunction with other parallel studies on other enzymes and other animals, serve to confirm the broad biological significance of enzyme-structure associations in the compartmentation of glycolysis. The existence and significance of genetic and epigenetic modifications of these enzymes during development is also discussed.
