The action and some properties of cathepsin D, partly purified from unfertilized loach eggs, embryos and skeletal muscles were determined. The enzyme from embryo cells displays the activity maximum at pH 3.0 and pH 4.8 while enzyme from skeletal muscles--only at pH 3.0. Cathepsin D purified from all three sources splits actively hemoglobin, albumin, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and practically does not influence casein, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The enzyme is comparatively thermolabile and its activity decreases in the presence of thiol compounds. The main part of cathepsin D in skeletal muscle cells and in embryo cells is precipitated after differential centrifugation of homogenates (25000 g; 60 min).
