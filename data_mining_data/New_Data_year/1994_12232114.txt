Inorganic phosphate (Pi) enrichment of the Pi-limited green alga Selenastrum minutum in the dark caused a 2.5-fold increase in the rate of O2 consumption. Alkalization of the media during Pi assimilation was consistent with a H+/Pi cotransport mechanism with a stoichiometry of at least 2 H+ cotransported per Pi. Dark O2 consumption remained enhanced beyond the period of Pi assimilation and did not recover until the medium was reacidified. This result, coupled with an immediate decrease in adenylate energy charge following Pi enrichment, suggested that respiration is regulated by the ATP requirements of a plasmalemma H+-ATPase that is activated to maintain intracellular pH and provide proton motive force to power Pi uptake. Concentrations of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates decreased following Pi enrichment and respiratory CO2 efflux increased, indicating that the tricarboxylic acid cycle was activated to supply reductant to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These results are consistent with direct inhibition of electron transport by ADP limitation. Enhanced rates of starch breakdown and increases in glycolytic metabolites indicated that respiratory carbon flow was activated to supply reductant to the electron transport chain and to rapidly assimilate Pi into metabolic intermediates. The mechanism that initiates glycolytic carbon flow could not be clearly identified by product:substrate ratios due to the complex nature of Pi assimilation. High levels of triose-P and low levels of phosphoenolpyruvate were the primary regulators of pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase, respectively.
