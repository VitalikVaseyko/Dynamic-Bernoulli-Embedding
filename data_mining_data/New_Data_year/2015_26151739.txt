The identification of two genes encoding polypeptides with structural features common with the estrogen receptor more than a quarter century ago, referred to as the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), subsequently led to the discovery of several previously unrecognized hormone responsive systems through the application of reverse endocrinology. Paradoxically, the natural ligand(s) associated with members of the ERR subfamily remains to be identified. While initial studies on the mode of action and physiological functions of the ERRs focused on interaction with estrogen signalling in breast cancer, subsequent work showed that the ERRs are ubiquitous master regulators of cellular energy metabolism. This review aims to demonstrate that the ERRs occupy a central node at the interface of cancer and metabolism, and that modulation of their activity may represent a worthwhile strategy to induce metabolic vulnerability in tumors of various origins and thus achieve a more comprehensive response to current therapies.
