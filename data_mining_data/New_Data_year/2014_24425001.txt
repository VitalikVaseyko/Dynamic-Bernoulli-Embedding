Adaptation of cancer cells to a hypoxic microenvironment is important for their facilitated malignant growth and advanced development. One major mechanism mediating the hypoxic response involves up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) expression, which controls reprogramming of energy metabolism and angiogenesis. Oestrogen-related receptor-alpha (ERRalpha) is a pivotal regulator of cellular energy metabolism and many biosynthetic pathways, and has also been proposed to be an important factor promoting the Warburg effect in advanced cancer. We and others have previously shown that ERRalpha expression is increased in prostate cancer and is also a prognostic marker. Here we show that ERRalpha is oncogenic in prostate cancer and also a key hypoxic growth regulator. ERRalpha-over-expressing prostate cancer cells were more resistant to hypoxia and showed enhanced HIF-1alpha protein expression and HIF-1 signalling. These effects could also be observed in ERRalpha-over-expressing cells grown under normoxia, suggesting that ERRalpha could function to pre-adapt cancer cells to meet hypoxia stress. Immunoprecipitation and FRET assays indicated that ERRalpha could physically interact with HIF-1alpha via its AF-2 domain. A ubiquitination assay showed that this ERRalpha-HIF-1alpha interaction could inhibit ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha and thus reduce its degradation. Such ERRalpha-HIF-1alpha interaction could be attenuated by XCT790, an ERRalpha-specific inverse agonist, resulting in reduced HIF-1alpha levels. In summary, we show that ERRalpha can promote the hypoxic growth adaptation of prostate cancer cells via a protective interaction with HIF-1alpha, suggesting ERRalpha as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
