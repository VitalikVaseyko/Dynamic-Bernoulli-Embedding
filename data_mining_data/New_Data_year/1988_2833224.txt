The effects of [leucine]enkephalin and angiotensin on hepatic carbohydrate and cyclic nucleotide metabolism are compared. Both peptides stimulated glycogenolysis as a result of an increase in phosphorylase a activity and enhanced glucose synthesis from [2-14C]pyruvate, although neither had any significant effect on pyruvate kinase activity. Although the magnitudes of the effects of both peptides on glycogenolysis were comparable and unaffected by the presence of insulin. [Leu]enkephalin proved to be more efficacious in enhancing gluconeogenesis, the response being comparable with that to glucagon. Both effectors decreased the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in hepatocytes when incubated under control conditions and after addition of sub-optimal concentrations of glucagon. This was correlated with the ability of the two peptides to inhibit both basal and hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in purified liver plasma membranes.
