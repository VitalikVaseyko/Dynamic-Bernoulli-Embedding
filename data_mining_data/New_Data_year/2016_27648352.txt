GLUT1, and to a lesser extent, GLUT3, appear to be interesting targets in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. The current review aims to give a brief history of the scientific community's understanding of these glucose transporters and to relate their importance to the metabolic changes that occur as a result of cancer. One of the primary changes that occurs in cancer, the Warburg Effect, is characterized by an extreme shift toward glycolysis from the usual reliance on oxidative phosphorylation and is currently being investigated to target the upstream and downstream factors responsible for Warburg-induced changes. Further, it aims to explain the differential expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in glioblastoma tissue, and how these modulations in expression can serve as targets to restore a more normal metabolism. Additionally, hypoxia-induced factor-1alpha's (HIF1alpha) role in a number of transcriptional changes typical to GBM will be discussed, including its role in GLUT upregulation. Finally, the four known subtypes of GBM [proneural, neural, mesenchymal, and classical] will be characterized in order to discuss how metabolic changes differ in each subtype. These changes have the potential to be selectively targeted in order to provide specificity to the clinical treatment options in GBM.
