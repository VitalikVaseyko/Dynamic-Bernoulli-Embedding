The rates of the ATPase [EC 3.6.1.3] reaction of the H-meromyosin-F-actin-relaxing protein system were measured in 2 mM MgCl2, 50mM KC1, and 10mM Tris-HC1 at pH 7.8 and 20 degrees in the presence and absence of 0.05-0.1 mM Ca2+ ions. The concentrations of H-meromyosin (HMM) and the F-actin-relaxing protein (F-A-PR) complex were 3.4 and 3 mg/ml, respectively, and the ATPase reaction was coupled with 4 mg/ml of pyruvate kinase [EC 2.7.1.40] and 1 or 20 mM phosphoenolpyruvate to regenerate ATP. The amount of ADP bound to HMM during the ATPase reaction was determined by measuring the amount of ADP remaining in the reaction mixture. The amount of ATP bound to HMM was determined by subtracting the amount of bound ADP from the total amount of nucleotides bound to HMM, which was measured by a rapid flow-dialysis method. The following results were obtained. 1. The ATPase activity of the HMM-F-A-RP system increased linearly with increase in the amount of ATP added, and was independent of the presence of 0.05 mM Ca2+, when the amount of ATP added was less than 1 mole/mole of HMM. In the presence of 0.05 mM Ca2+, the ATPase activity reached a maximal level when 1.2-1.5 mole of ATP was added per mole of HMM, and maintained this level even at 3 moles of added ATP/mole of HMM. In the presence of 3mM EGTA, the ATPase activity decreased with increase in the amount of ATP added, from 1.5 to 3 moles of ATP/mole of HMM, and reached the level of the HMM ATPase reaction at 3 moles of added ATP/mole of HMM. Similar results were observed when the concentration of HMM was maintained at 3.4 mg/ml and the concentration of the F-A-RP complex was decreased from 3 to 1 or 0.5 mg/ml.
