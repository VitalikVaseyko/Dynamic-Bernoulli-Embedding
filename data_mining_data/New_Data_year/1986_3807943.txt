The glycosomes of in vitro grown procyclic trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma brucei were purified by three different procedures and the results compared by electron microscopy, enzyme assays and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Centrifugation on a self-forming Percoll gradient followed by a sucrose gradient centrifugation resulted in the least enriched glycosomal preparation. Centrifugation on a pre-formed Nycodenz gradient gave an improved preparation but the most homogeneous preparation of intact glycosomes was obtained after centrifugation on two successive sucrose gradients. Glycosomes purified by both the Nycodenz and double sucrose gradient procedures appeared larger than in situ glycosomes presumably due to an osmotic effect resulting from disruption of the granular matrix of the organelles. Nevertheless, there appears to be no loss of cisternal contents due to the swelling of the organelles. The glycosomes of the bloodstream form trypomastigotes purified by the same procedures show, however, no sign of swelling. A comparison of glycosomes purified from procyclic trypomastigotes and bloodstream form trypomastigotes prepared by the same double sucrose procedure demonstrated that in the glycosome of procyclic trypomastigotes: activities of hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructose kinase, aldolase and phosphoglycerate kinase and diminished by 80-100%; activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase remain unchanged or are only slightly reduced; there is an appearance of four major new proteins, among which could be phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase and malate dehydrogenase. These observations are in basic agreement with those by Hart et al. (Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 12, 25-35, 1984).
