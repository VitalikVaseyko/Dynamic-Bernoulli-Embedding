A fluorescent study of some structural and functional properties of conjugates of a number of proteins (bovine serum albumin, pyruvate kinase, alpha-chymotrypsin, and the two toxic proteins of plant origin--ricin and viscumin) with polyalkylene oxides (polyethylene glycol and pluronic) has been carried out. Analysis of the intrinsic protein fluorescence showed that the structure and stability of various protein conjugates to denaturing agents change only slightly: the conformational mobility of tryptophan residues accessible to the solvent decreases, whereas that of tryptophan residues localized in the protein regions of low polarity remains unchanged. Besides, the conjugates display a higher thermal stability in comparison with their native proteins. The fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid and water insoluble 2',3',4',5'-tetrabenzoylriboflavin bound to the native and modified proteins indicated that modification of the proteins with polyalkylene oxides decreased the polarity and increased the viscosity of the microenvironment. Hence, this modification makes it possible to change some functional characteristics of the protein without causing any significant changes in its structure.
