The metabolic activity in cancer cells primarily rely on aerobic glycolysis. Besides glycolysis, some tumor cells also exhibit excessive addition to glutamine, which constitutes an advantage for tumor growth. M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2) plays a pivotal role in sustaining aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and serine synthesis pathway. However, the participation of PKM2 in glutaminolysis is little to be known. Here we demonstrated that PKM2 depletion could provoke glutamine metabolism by enhancing the beta-catenin signaling pathway and consequently promoting its downstream c-Myc-mediated glutamine metabolism in colon cancer cells. Treatment with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, got consistent results with the above. In addition, the dimeric form of PKM2, which lacks the pyruvate kinase activities, plays a critical role in regulating beta-catenin. Moreover, we found that overexpression of PKM2 negatively regulated beta-catenin through miR-200a. These insights supply evidence that glutaminolysis plays a compensatory role for cell survival upon glucose metabolism impaired.
