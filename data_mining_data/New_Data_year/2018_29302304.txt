Aluminium (Al) toxicity is one of the most important limiting factors for crop yield in acidic soils. However, the mechanisms that confer Al tolerance still remain largely unknown. To understand the molecular mechanism that confers different tolerance to Al, we performed global transcriptome analysis to the roots and leaves of two contrasting soybean genotypes, BX10 (Al-tolerant) and BD2 (Al-sensitive) under 0 and 50 muM Al(3+) treatments, respectively. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that the expression levels of the genes involved in lipid/carbohydrate metabolism and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated signalling pathway were highly induced in the roots and leaves of both soybean genotypes. The gene encoding enzymes, including pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, ATP-citrate lyase and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 2, associated with organic acid metabolism were differentially expressed in the BX10 roots. In addition, the genes involved in citrate transport were differentially expressed. Among these genes, FRD3b was down-regulated only in BD2, whereas the other two multidrug and toxic compound extrusion genes were up-regulated in both soybean genotypes. These findings confirmed that BX10 roots secreted more citrate than BD2 to withstand Al stress. The gene encoding enzymes or regulators, such as lipoxygenase, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, acyl-CoA oxidase and jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins, involved in JA biosynthesis and signalling were preferentially induced in BD2 leaves. This finding suggests that the JA defence response was activated, possibly weakening the growth of aerial parts because of excessive resource consumption and ATP biosynthesis deficiency. Our results suggest that the Al sensitivity in some soybean varieties could be attributed to the low level of citrate metabolism and exudation in the roots and the high level of JA-mediated defence response in the leaves.
