An electrode configuration is described which allows fast isoelectric focusing (IEF) with conventional IEF systems. The equipment, which can be fixed on the cooling plate of a conventional IEF system, consists of a base plate on which flappable electrode holders are fastened. The handling is simple and needs only little time. Graphite rods are used as electrodes, thus avoiding the use of buffer strips. Samples are applied with special applicator strips--permitting the analysis of up to 19 samples on a 50 x 40 mm polyacrylamide gel and up to 44 samples on a 100 x 70 mm gel. Only 30 min are needed for one IEF run.
