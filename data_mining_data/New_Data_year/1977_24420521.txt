In sycamore cells grown on nitrate as opposed to glutamate there is a higher pentose phosphate pathway carbon flux relative to glycolysis in the early stages of cell growth when nitrate assimilation is most active. The high pentose phosphate pathway activity compared with glycolysis in nitrate grown cells is accompanied by enhanced levels of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate de-hydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and transketolase. There is no significant increase in activity of the solely glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase. It is suggested that the increased pentose phosphate pathway activity in nitrate grown cells is correlated with a demand by nitrite assimilation for NADPH.
