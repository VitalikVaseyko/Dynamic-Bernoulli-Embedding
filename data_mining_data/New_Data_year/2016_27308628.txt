Cancer cells become dependent on aerobic glycolysis to sustain rapid proliferation and escape apoptosis. How this metabolic change, also known as the Warburg effect, is linked to apoptosis remains largely unknown. Our new data place c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the center of a hub regulating apoptosis and cancer metabolism.
