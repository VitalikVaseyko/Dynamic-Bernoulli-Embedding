1. Blood samples obtained from 114 animals of three species of the genus Gazella (Gazella dama, Gazella dorcas and Gazella cuvieri) were analyzed from hematology (osmotic fragility, red blood cells morphology and hemoglobin electrophoresis) and biochemical values (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and glutathione reductase deficiencies and superoxide dismutase activity). 2. Standard methods were used. Hemoglobin polymorphism was found. 3. There was no abnormality in the osmotic fragility and red blood cells morphology. 4. The biochemical results are compared with information from the literature and with the normal human range.
