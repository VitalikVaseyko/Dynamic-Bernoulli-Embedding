Beutler's screening procedure was used to detect pyruvate kinase deficiency in the local population. In this test, hemolysate and the reagent mixture are incubated and then placed at a spot on filter paper to be examined for fluorescence. Complete nonfluorescence marks the reaction endpoint, and fluorescence beyond 30 minutes indicates pyruvate kinase deficiency. It was difficult to determine this endpoint due to uneven sedimentation of unhemolyzed red cells on the spot. In this modified technique, the leukocyte-depleted red cell suspension was frozen and thawed for complete red cell lysis before being used for the test. Using both techniques, 493 health individuals and 126 anemic patients were screened for pyruvate kinase deficiency. By the conventional technique, 3.7% remained fluorescent after 30 minutes, whereas by the modified technique, none were fluorescent after 30 minutes. Quantitative assay indicated that all samples had pyruvate kinase activity levels greater than the lower limit of the reference range. We also demonstrated that blood samples from individuals with thalassemia trait were primarily responsible for the aberrant results from the conventional screening procedure.
