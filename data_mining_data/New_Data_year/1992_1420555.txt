Activities of certain cytoplasmic enzymes were measured in bovine T lymphoma (BTL-PC3 cells). The activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in PC3 cells were elevated as much as 2 or 3-fold of those in bovine thymocyte. The high activities of these enzymes derived from activation of glucose metabolism may reflect the high growth potential of PC3 cells.
