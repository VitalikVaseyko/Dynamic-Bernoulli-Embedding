BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer cells consume high amounts of glucose to produce ATP and molecules entering biosynthesis. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that glucose deprivation and/or glycolysis inhibition arrest cancer cell growth and may increase the efficiency of cytotoxic drugs. In contrast, increasing glycolysis in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) activates these cells that destroy cancer cells. We propose to increase the efficiency of chemotherapy by modulating glucose intake during the course of chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Glucose and caloric intake should be drastically reduced the day before and during chemotherapy administration to deprive cancer cells of ATP and molecules required to repair cytotoxic lesions. Few hours after chemotherapy, glucose and caloric intake should be drastically increased for few days to promote the activation of TILs that reinforce the destruction of cancer cells. RESULTS: This strategy could improve the results of chemotherapy by first enhancing cytotoxic stress against tumor cells and then promoting activation of the anti-cancer immune response. CONCLUSION: The modulation of glucose intake during chemotherapy should be tested clinically. The proposed scheme is simple, surely easier to follow than a strict chronic diet, and should avoid weight loss.
