Antibody prepared against the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A from rabbit skeletal muscle, could completely inhibit this enzyme, but did not significantly affect the activities of protein phosphatases-1, 2B and 2C. The antibody was used to establish the following points. The three forms of protein phosphatase-2A that can be resolved by ion-exchange chromatography, termed 2A0, 2A1, and 2A2, share the same catalytic subunit. The antigenic sites on the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A remain accessible to the antibody, when the catalytic subunit is complexed with the other subunits of protein phosphatases-2A0, 2A1 and 2A2. The catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase-2A from rabbit skeletal muscle and rabbit liver are very similar, as judged by immunotitration experiments. Protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2A account for virtually all the phosphorylase phosphatase activity in dilute tissue extracts prepared from skeletal muscle, liver, heart, brain and kidney, and for essentially all the glycogen synthase phosphatase activity in dilute skeletal muscle and liver extracts. Protein phosphatase-2A is almost absent from the protein-glycogen complex prepared from skeletal muscle or liver extracts. Protein phosphatase-2A accounts for a major proportion of the phosphatase activity in dilute liver extracts towards 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase and phenylalanine hydroxylase, the major phosphorylated enzymes involved in the hormonal control of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.
