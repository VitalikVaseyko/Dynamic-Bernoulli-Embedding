In contrast to the Mg2+-activated enzyme, in the presence of Mn2+ pyruvate kinase exhibits hyperbolic kinetics with respect to the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and is insensitive to fructose 1,6-biphosphate, phenylalanine and alanine. However, with both metal activated species inhibition by excess ADP is observed. In contrast with Mg2+, which affords significant protection against inactivation caused by 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid), the rate of inactivation by this reagent is increased in the presence of Mn2+. Differences in conformational changes induced by combination of pyruvate kinase with Mg2+ or Mn2+ were indicated by u.v. difference spectra.
