The age changes of 2,3-DPG concentration, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities in pigs erythroid cells during the first 10 days after birth have been investigated for study of the mechanism of blood oxygen-transport function regulation at the early stages of postnatal adaptation. It was established, that there are age peculiarities in young, mature and old erythrocytes metabolism in piglets during the transition to postnatal development. It was shown that the rise of 2,3-DPG, the allosteric effector of hemoglobin oxygen affinity level, is due to the increased activities of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase and hexokinase after birth, that is particularly characteristic of the young pigs erythrocytes.
