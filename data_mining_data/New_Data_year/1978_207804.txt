Cytidine 5'-diphospho-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (CDP-diglyceride) hydrolase, CDP-diglyceride:L-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase, and CDP-diglyceride:sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase all release CMP from their liponucleotide substrate, CDP-diglyceride. We have developed a spectrophotometric assay for these enzymes using CMP kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase to couple the release of CMP with the oxidation of NADH. The assay for each of the phospholipid-dependent enzymes was found to be linear both with time and with enzyme concentration. The assay should prove useful for continuous monitoring of enzymatic activity, determination of initial rates of reaction, and detailed kinetic analysis of these enzymes. Since several enzymes and substrates are used in the coupled assay system, the method is limited to analysis of partially purified preparations lacking competing activities.
