The possible physiological role of estrogen in the regulation of energy metabolism of epididymis and vas deferens of rhesus monkey was investigated. A few selected key enzymes of glycolysis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase) and TCA cycle (succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase) were measured in these two organs of (a) castrated estrogen treated, (b) castrated estrogen + dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treated animals and compared with those in castrated and castrated + DHT treated animals. Results reveal that DHT stimulated the activities of all these enzymes whereas estrogen failed to stimulate any of the enzymes in castrated animals. However, estrogen in combination with DHT caused a marked stimulation of the enzymes and the response of the epididymis and vas deferens to combination treatment was significantly more than that caused by DHT alone. The results suggest that circulating estrogen in male has a physiological role and acts synergistically with androgen in regulating accessory sex organ function.
