The effect of thyroidectomy (Tx) on some key enzymes involved in glycolysis and the HMP-shunt pathway were studied in the testis of pre-pubertal, pubertal and adult rats. Hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) did not show any significant change in activity after Tx. However, pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was reduced after Tx in the testis of pre-pubertal animals although in pubertal and adult rats it was not affected. Both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PG-DH) activities were reduced after Tx and thyroxine (T4) replacement brought both enzyme activities back towards normal. The possible effect of the thyroid on testicular steroidogenesis acting through the HMP-shunt is discussed.
