Small molecules that inhibit common cancer-associated changes in metabolism have great potential as widely applicable therapies. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Kung et al. report the characterization of a small molecule activator of the enzyme pyruvate kinase M2, which reprograms cancer cell metabolism resulting in dependence on the amino acid serine.
