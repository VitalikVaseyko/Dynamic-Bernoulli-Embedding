Two new kinetic analyses for mammalian hexokinases are presented, which permit one to study the regulation of these enzymes by product inhibition. One method uses the pyruvate kinase-coupled assay and the other the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. Both methods give simple linear plots, which indicate that the magnesium-ATP complex overcomes the glucose 6-phosphate inhibition competitively, but by atypical kinetics. A new regulation coefficient (Kr) was defined and it was shown that, with both assay methods, the reciprocals of the slopes of the simple linear plots are proportional to Kr.[Mg.ATP].NADP, but not NAD, was found to be a powerful inhibitor of pig heart hexokinase.
