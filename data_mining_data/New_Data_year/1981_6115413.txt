Intermediates have been synthesized that are rapidly utilized by triose phosphate isomerase, yeast aldolase and pyruvate kinase. In each case the compounds have the properties of an enol expected for a stepwise proton transfer mechanism. Apparently the apparatus required for doing this chemistry is sufficiently unique for a large measure of structural homology to have been imposed upon the enzymes of this class during evolution.
