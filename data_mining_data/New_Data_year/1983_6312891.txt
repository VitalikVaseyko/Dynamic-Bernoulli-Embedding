Glucagon and dibutyryl cyclic AMP inhibited glucose utilization and lowered fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels of hepatocytes prepared from fed chickens. Partially purified preparations of chicken liver 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase were activated and inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, respectively. The sensitivities of these enzymes and the changes observed in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels are consistent with an important role for this allosteric effector in hormonal regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in chicken liver. In contrast, oleate inhibition of glucose utilization by chicken hepatocytes occurred without change in fructose, 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Likewise, pyruvate inhibition of lactate gluconeogenesis in chicken hepatocytes cannot be explained by changes in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Exogenous glucose caused a marked increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content of hepatocytes from fasted but not fed birds. Both glucagon and lactate prevented this glucose effect. Fasted chicken hepatocytes responded to lower glucose concentrations than fasted rat hepatocytes, perhaps reflecting the species difference in hexokinase isozymes.
