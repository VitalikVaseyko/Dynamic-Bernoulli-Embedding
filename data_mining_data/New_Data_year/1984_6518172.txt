It has been shown in the experiments on rat liver mitochondria under glucose hexo-kinase load that excess of substrates of (1-20 mM) pyruvate, acetate, propionate, pent-4-enoate and malate may induce oxidation of NAD(P)H and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (by 20-50% and more) due to a decreased rate of hydrogen production by tricarboxylic acid cycle. It has been concluded from the analysis of mathematical models and metabolite-testings which remove this inhibition that for pyruvate and acetate this inhibition is an autocatalytic one. It is related to a decreased level of CoA and oxaloacetate due to the formation of "traps" such as acetyl-CoA and alpha-kotoglutarate. For propionate and pent-4-enoate in the bicarbonate-free medium suppression of the flux in the cycle is concerned with a decreased level of CoA, acetyl-CoA and succionoyl CoA due to the accumulation of propionyl-CoA. It seems to be also concerned with the inhibition of citrate-synthetase and alpha-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase by propionyl-CoA. Malate (in the presence of malonate) can inhibit respiration at the expense of direct inhibition of citrate-synthetase.
