1. Evidence is presented that exposure of epididymal fat-pads from fed rats to insulin leads to a marked diminution in the Km for phosphoenolpyruvate of pyruvate kinase. Effects of insulin may be readily demonstrated in experiments both in vivo and in vitro and are not secondary to the activation by the hormone of glucose transport. No effect of insulin is apparent in tissues from 48 h-starved animals. 2. The mechanism of the effect of insulin on pyruvate kinase was not established. The observed changes in Km do not appear to be the result of alterations in the amounts of bound effectors such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and alanine. Rather, as the effect persists in incubated extracts, it appears that a change in the degree of phosphorylation or some other covalent modification of the enzyme may be involved.
