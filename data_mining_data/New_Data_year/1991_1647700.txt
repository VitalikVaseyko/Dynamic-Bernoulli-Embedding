6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2) was analyzed in four organs of the anoxia-tolerant marine gastropod mollusk Busycon canaliculatum. Whelk PFK-2 resembled the nonhepatic enzyme from mammals with highest activity occurring in gill (22 pmol.min-1.g-1). Hepatopancreas PFK-2 was purified over 8,000-fold to a final specific activity of 11 mU/mg protein (at 20 degrees C) and gave a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was a dimer with a native molecular mass of 142 kDa and a subunit molecular mass of 67 kDa. The purified enzyme showed negligible fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) activity, although the activity ratio of PFK-2 to FBPase-2 was 0.625 in crude extracts. In response to environmental anoxia, the activity of PFK-2 dropped in all organs to 34-56% of the corresponding aerobic value (half-time was 2 h in gill), and the Michaelis constant for fructose 6-phosphate increased by 50% (to 92 microM in gill). These changes paralleled decreases in organ fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration and pyruvate kinase activity and contribute to the overall glycolytic rate depression induced by anoxia in this facultative anaerobe. In vitro treatment of the anoxic form of hepatopancreas PFK-2 with alkaline phosphatase increased enzyme activity, suggesting that the aerobic and anoxic enzyme forms are interconverted by reversible protein phosphorylation. However, the protein kinase involved in this process is not yet known; incubation of aerobic PFK-2 with Mg-ATP plus adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C did not alter enzyme activity.
