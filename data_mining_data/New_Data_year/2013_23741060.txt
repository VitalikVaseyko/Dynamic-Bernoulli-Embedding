UNLABELLED: Activation of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells is well known as the Warburg effect, although its relation to cell- cycle progression remains unknown. In this study, human colon cancer cells were labeled with a cell-cycle phase-dependent fluorescent marker Fucci to distinguish cells in G1-phase and those in S + G2/M phases. Fucci-labeled cells served as splenic xenograft transplants in super-immunodeficient NOG mice and exhibited multiple metastases in the livers, frozen sections of which were analyzed by semiquantitative microscopic imaging mass spectrometry. Results showed that cells in G1-phase exhibited higher concentrations of ATP, NADH, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine than those in S and G2-M phases, suggesting accelerated glycolysis in G1-phase cells in vivo. Quantitative determination of metabolites in cells synchronized in S, G2-M, and G1 phases suggested that efflux of lactate was elevated significantly in G1-phase. By contrast, ATP production in G2-M was highly dependent on mitochondrial respiration, whereas cells in S-phase mostly exhibited an intermediary energy metabolism between G1 and G2-M phases. Isogenic cells carrying a p53-null mutation appeared more active in glycolysis throughout the cell cycle than wild-type cells. Thus, as the cell cycle progressed from G2-M to G1 phases, the dependency of energy production on glycolysis was increased while the mitochondrial energy production was reciprocally decreased. IMPLICATIONS: These results shed light on distinct features of the phase-specific phenotypes of metabolic systems in cancer cells.
