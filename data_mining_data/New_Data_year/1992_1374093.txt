Four monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for the L-type isoenzyme of rat pyruvate kinase (L-PK) were produced and characterized. They detect at least two different epitopes of the isoenzyme, as shown in interference binding assay and Western blot analysis after peptide mapping. The MAb were used in immunohistology to demonstrate the L-PK isoenzyme in paraffin-embedded normal rat tissues. L-PK was found only in hepatocytes, kidney proximal tubules, islet cells of pancreas, and epithelial cells of the villi of small intestine. The content of L-PK in hepatocytes was often lower in the periportal areas as compared with the periveneous zone. In kidneys a clearcut difference in L-PK content and distribution existed between male and female rats. Male animals possessed more L-PK in the kidney cortex than females. The L-PK content in the inner cortical zone (straight proximal tubules) was higher than in the outer cortical zone (convoluted proximal tubules) in kidneys of males. In contrast, female rats displayed less L-PK in the inner than in the outer cortical zone of the kidneys. Only some of them exhibited the same amount of the isoenzyme in both parts of the kidney proximal tubules.
