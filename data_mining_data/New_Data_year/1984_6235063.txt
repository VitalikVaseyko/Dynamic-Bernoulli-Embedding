In order to study the three regulator enzymes of glycolysis, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), in relation to lymphocyte maturation, lymphocytes of different origin were investigated. Lymphocytes from bone marrow, thymus, cord blood, adult peripheral blood and mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes were investigated. The enzyme activities were determined and the isozyme patterns were studied by means of electrophoresis, kinetic measurements and immunoprecipitation. The young lymphocytes from bone marrow and the mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes could be distinguished from the other lymphocytes by a higher residual HK activity in the presence of the inhibitor glucose-1,6-diphosphate. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes differed from non-T lymphocytes in the PK isozymes distribution. All the cells contained PK type K4 and the hybrid K3M. In T cells a smaller amount of the K isozyme was seen than in non-T cells. The PK residual activity in the presence of alanine was significantly higher in peripheral blood T cells than in non-T cells. Thymocytes are characterised by a larger amount of PFK M-subunits than peripheral blood T and non-T lymphocytes. The stimulation of PFK by the positive effector glucose-1,6-diphosphate was higher in thymocytes than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes.
