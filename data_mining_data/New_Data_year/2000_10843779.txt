The observation that the level of S-thiolated proteins (protein-thiol mixed disulfides) was transiently increased in the lens epithelial cells correlation with the transient inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3PD), a key glycolytic enzyme, when the cells were treated with a bolus of hydrogen peroxide, prompted our speculation that G-3PD may have been transiently thiolated at the SH sensitive active center. In the meantime, thioltransferase (TTase), a thiol regulating enzyme, whose activity remained constant under the same condition, may be regulating G-3PD and other sulfhydryl-sensitive glycolytic enzymes through thiol-disulfide exchange reactions ( Lou et al., 1998 ). To prove this hypothesis, several purified glycolytic enzymes from a commercial source, including hexokinase (HK), G-3PD, pyruvate kinase (PK) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), an enzyme in gluconeogenesis, were made into protein-thiol mixed disulfide and used for this study. Glycolytic enzymes in cultured rabbit lens epithelial cells pre-exposed to H(2)O(2)(0.5 m M for 15 min) were also studied for this purpose. Recombinant human lens thioltransferase (RHLT), which was isolated and purified previously in this laboratory, reactivated these pure glycolytic enzymes inactivated by forming protein-S-S-gluthathione (PSSG), protein-S-S-cysteine (PSSC) or, protein-S-S-cysteamine after thiolating with oxidized glutathione, cystine or cystamine respectively. RHLT also reactivated these enzymes in the cell extract of cultured rabbit lens epithelial cells after being briefly exposed to 0.5 m M H(2)O(2). The S-thiolation and dethiolation of FBPase however, showed an opposite effect to that of glycolytic enzymes. These results suggest that TTase may participate in the repair process of glycolytic enzymes during oxidative stress and restore their activities in situ.
