The parameters of oxidative phosphorylation and its interaction with creatine kinase (CK)- and adenylate kinase (AK)-phosphotransfer networks in situ were studied in skinned atrial fibers from 59 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, valve replacement/correction and atrial septal defect correction. In atria, the mitochondrial CK and AK are effectively coupled to oxidative phosphorylation, the MM-CK is coupled to ATPases and there exists a direct transfer of adenine nucleotides between mitochondria and ATPases. Elimination of cytoplasmic ADP with exogenous pyruvate kinase was not associated with a blockade of the stimulatory effects of creatine and AMP on respiration, neither could it abolish the coupling of MM-CK to ATPases and direct transfer of adenine nucleotides. Thus, atrial energy metabolism is compartmentalized so that mitochondria form functional complexes with adjacent ATPases. These complexes isolate a part of cellular adenine nucleotides from their cytoplasmic pool for participating in energy transfer via CK- and AK-networks, and/or direct exchange. Compared to atria in sinus rhythm, the fibrillating atria were larger and exhibited increased succinate-dependent respiration relative to glutamate-dependent respiration and augmented proton leak. Thus, alterations in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may contribute to pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation.
