OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gene expression profiles in lung adenocarcinoma (LA), tumor adjacent tissue (TAT) and fetal lung tissue (FLT) by cDNA microarray technique. METHODS: Total RNA from LA, TAT and FLT was extracted and purified. The cDNA was made by RT-PCR, and then labeled with Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescence as probes which were hybridized with the whole gene chips. Subsequently, the signal images were scanned by ScanArray 4000 fluorescence scanner and analyzed by Gene Pix PRO3.0. RESULTS: In 4 cases with LA and TAT, 25 genes were screened out for differences in gene expression level, among which 3 were upregulated and 22 downregulated; in FLT and TAT cases, 316 genes were screened out, among which 192 were upregulated and 124 downregulated; 16 genes were found to be differentially expressed genes in common in LA, TAT and FLT, among which 12 were upregulated and 4 downregulated. CONCLUSION: The 25 differentially expressed genes in LA and TAT may be related to occurrence and development of lung cancer, while the 316 genes in FLT and TAT may be related to fetal developmental. The 16 differentially expressed genes may be related to the initiation of lung cancer.
