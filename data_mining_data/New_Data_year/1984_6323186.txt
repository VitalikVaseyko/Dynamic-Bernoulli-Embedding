In this study pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and aldolase are investigated in two types of embryonal tumors, neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas; the results are compared with similar studies in gliomas. The activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase are significantly decreased in neuroblastomas. In neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma all five forms of pyruvate kinase (K4, K3M, K2M2, KM3 and M4) are present. In contrast, the gliomas investigated are characterized by the presence of mainly K4 and a little K3M. In neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas and gliomas, hexokinase type I is present; in addition, hexokinase type II is present in two medulloblastomas. Aldolase A is the predominant isozyme in all tumors investigated; this is in contrast with normal nervous tissue. It can be concluded that the isozyme characteristics especially of pyruvate kinase from neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas are comparable with similar findings in retinoblastoma; these findings support the hypothesis that these three tumors have a common embryonic origin.
