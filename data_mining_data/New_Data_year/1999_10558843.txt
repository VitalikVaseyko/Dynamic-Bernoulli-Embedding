Theileria parva schizonts propagated in vitro in peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified and assayed for key enzymes of glucose and glycerol catabolism and the citric acid cycle. The activities of glycolytic enzymes were in the range of 21-100 nmol/min/mg protein. Glycerol kinase and alpha -glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities were more than 16 times lower than the activities of other enzymes catalysing the oxidation of the triose phosphates to lactate. It was suggested that the catabolism of glycerol is negligible and that glucose is catabolized to lactate via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. The activities of the enzymes catalysing the section of the citric acid cycle that involves the formation of citrate to succinyl-CoA were consistently very low (less than 2.0 nmol/min/mg protein), indicating that this part of the cycle plays a minor role in this parasite. Enzyme activities of the cycle catalysing the formation of succinate from oxaloacetate were relatively higher than those catalysing other sections of the citric acid cycle, suggesting that this section of the cycle could be important to the parasite. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was more than 10 times that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. It was suggested that pyruvate could be carboxylated to oxaloacetate. Taken together, these results suggest that the catabolism of glucose in Theileria parva schizonts is mainly via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and that the citric acid cycle plays a minor role in energy production.
