Clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer therapy is limited by its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. But molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been well defined. This study was to investigate the effect of DOX on the changes of global genomics in hearts. Acute cardiotoxicity was induced by giving C57BL/6J mice a single intraperitoneal injection of DOX (15 mg/kg). Cardiac function and apoptosis were monitored using echocardiography and TUNEL assay at days 1, 3 and 5. Myocardial glucose and ATP levels were measured. Microarray assays were used to screen gene expression profiles in the hearts at day 5, and the results were confirmed with qPCR analysis. DOX administration caused decreased cardiac function, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and decreased glucose and ATP levels. Microarrays showed 747 up-regulated genes and 438 down-regulated genes involved in seven main functional categories. Among them, metabolic pathway was the most affected by DOX. Several key genes, including 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase (Bpgm), hexokinase 2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4 and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase, are closely related to glucose metabolism. Gene co-expression networks suggested the core role of Bpgm in DOX cardiomyopathy. These results obtained in mice were further confirmed in cultured cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, genes involved in glucose metabolism, especially Bpgm, may play a central role in the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
