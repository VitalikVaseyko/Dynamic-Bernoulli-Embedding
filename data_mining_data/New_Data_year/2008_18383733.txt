The effect of cold exposure (-10 degrees C, air speed--2.5 m/sec, 40 minutes) on physical activity, cognitive processes and metabolic status of 75 volunteers, healthy men of 20-24, was studied in termobarocomplex Tabaj (Japan). Cold exposure reduced physical and cognitive activity, the activity of kreatine phosphokinase, superoxide dismutase, the levels of redox glutation and pyruvate. Preliminary administration of adaptogenic drug trekrezan 0.2 g prior to cold exposure normalized the indexes studied of physical activity and metabolic status. It is suggested that trekrezan can be used as a meteoadaptogenic drug for rapid and effective adaptation to cold exposure of environment.
