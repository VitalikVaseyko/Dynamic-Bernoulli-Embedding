Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a valuable technique for the generation of genetically engineered animals, however, the efficiency of cloning in mammalian species is low (1-3%). Differentiated somatic cells commonly used in nuclear transfer utilize the tricarboxylic acid cycle and cellular respiration for energy production. Comparatively the metabolism of somatic cells contrasts that of the cells within the early embryos which predominately use glycolysis. Early embryos (prior to implantation) are evidenced to exhibit characteristics of a Warburg Effect (WE)-like metabolism. We hypothesized that pharmacologically driven fibroblast cells can become more blastomere-like and result in improved in vitro embryonic development after SCNT. The goals were to determine if subsequent in vitro embryo development is impacted by (1) cloning pharmacologically treated donor cells pushed to have a WE-like metabolism or (2) culturing non-treated donor clones with pharmaceuticals used to push a WE-like metabolism. Additionally, we investigated early gestational survival of the donor-treated clone embryos. Here we demonstrate that in vitro development of clones is not hindered by pharmacologically treating either the donor cells or the embryos themselves with CPI, PS48, or the combination of these drugs. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that early embryos (or at least in vitro produced embryos) have a low proportion of mitochondria which have high membrane potential and treatment with these pharmaceuticals does not further alter the mitochondrial function in early embryos. Lastly, we show that survival in early gestation was not different between clones from pharmacologically induced WE-like donor cells and controls.
