Activities of pyruvate kinase, lactate and malate dehydrogenases as well as concentration of oxaloacetate, lactic and pyruvic acids and of glycerol-I-phosphate were altered in liver tissues of rats with alloxane diabetes. Alteration in activity of LDH and MDH isoenzymes appears to be responsible for regulation of the content of pyrimidine nucleotides oxidized and reduced forms, which limit the glucose oxidation.
