A case of polymyositis associated with chronic active hepatitis was reported. A 53-year-old man, who had no previous history of blood transfusion nor hepatitis, noticed proximal dominant muscle weakness on January 29, 1985. He was admitted to Kyoto National Hospital on February 7, and laboratory studies disclosed the elevation of serum enzyme levels; creatine kinase (CK) 9845 IU/L (normal 54-263), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) 834 IU/L (9-31), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) 491 IU/L (4-34), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 2135 IU/L (248-464). Also serum gamma globulin was high (1.8 g/dl) and LE-like cell was found. The diagnosis of polymyositis was made and prednisolone therapy (60 mg/day) was started on February 23. The elevated serum enzymes decreased gradually, but severe muscle weakness persisted for about one month. On April 3, he was admitted to our hospital. Physical examination revealed moderate proximal dominant muscle weakness without skin eruption, jaundice or hepatosplenomegaly. The serum enzymes were still high; CK 1826, GOT 173, GPT 232 (GOT less than GPT), LDH 1548. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin were normal. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was not detected. Antinuclear antibody was positive. The electromyogram study showed myopathic change, and the muscle biopsy demonstrated myopathic change and cell infiltration, compatible with polymyositis. These results suggested liver dysfunction associated with polymyositis. Prednisolone therapy was continued and muscle weakness decreased. From December, 1985, serum enzymes (CK, GOT, GPT, LDH) elevated again and muscle weakness also slightly increased. Anti-smooth muscle antibody was positive. It was suggested that both polymyositis and liver dysfunction deteriorated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
