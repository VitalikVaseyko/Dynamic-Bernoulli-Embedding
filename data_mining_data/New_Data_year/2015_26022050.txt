In this issue of Blood, Jitschin et al demonstrate a microenvironmental glycolytic shift in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells mediated by Notch-c-Myc signaling. Interfering in the Notch-c-Myc pathway and reprogramming glycolytic metabolism could contribute to overcoming drug resistance in CLL.
