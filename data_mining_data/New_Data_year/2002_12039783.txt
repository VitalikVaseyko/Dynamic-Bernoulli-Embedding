The effect of Mn2+ amendment on peroxidase gene expression was studied during Pleurotus ostreatus growth on cotton stalks. Four peroxidase-encoding genes were expressed differentially and in a manner different from that observed in defined media. Mn2+ affects mnp3 expression even 2 h after its addition to the cultures, suggesting a direct effect of the metal ion on expression.
