The property of glucose nonfermentation, characteristic of the genus Veillonella, was investigated in V. alcalescens C1, a strain of sheep rumen origin. Cell-free extracts as well as intact cells were incapable of glucose fermentation, thereby eliminating the possibility of nonpermeation. Assimilation of (14)C-glucose was not detectable. Of the 10 glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphoglyceromutase, and pyruvate kinase were not detectable. The other glycolytic enzymes were present.
