The activity of the erythrocyte enzymes: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glutathion reductase and ATPase were measured in 8 patients with untreated myelomatosis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was significantly increased. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase values were negatively correlated with the glomerular filtration rate as measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance. The results support the existence of a shortened red cell survival in peripheral blood related to the degree of renal insufficiency.
