1. Intracellular concentrations of intermediates and cofactors of glycolysis were measured in guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices incubated under varying conditions. 2. Comparison of mass-action ratios with apparent equilibrium constants for the reactions of glycolysis showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase catalyse reactions generally far from equilibrium, whereas phosphoglucose isomerase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, adenlyate kinase and creatine phosphokinase are generally close to equilibrium. The possibility that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase may catalyse a ;non-equilibrium' reaction is discussed. 3. Correlation of changes in concentrations of substrates for enzymes catalysing ;non-equilibrium' reactions with changes in rates of glycolysis caused by alteration of the conditions of incubation showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and possibly glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase are subject to metabolic control in cerebral cortex slices. 4. It is suggested that the glycolysis is controlled by two regulatory systems, the hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-pyruvate kinase system. These are discussed. 5. It is concluded that the rate of glycolysis in guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices is limited either by the rate of glucose entry into the slices or by the hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system. 6. It is concluded that addition of 0.1mm-ouabain to guinea-pig cerebral cortex slices causes inhibition of either glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or phosphoglycerate kinase or both, in a manner independent of the known action of ouabain on the sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase.
