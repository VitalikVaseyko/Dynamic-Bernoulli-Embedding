Actinobacillus sp. 130Z fermented glucose to the major products succinate, acetate, and formate. Ethanol was formed as a minor fermentation product. Under CO2-limiting conditions, less succinate and more ethanol were formed. The fermentation product ratio remained constant at pH values from 6.0 to 7.4. More succinate was produced when hydrogen was present in the gas phase. Actinobacillus sp. 130Z grew at the expense of fumarate and l-malate reduction, with hydrogen as an electron donor. Other substrates such as more-reduced carbohydrates (e.g., d-sorbitol) resulted in higher succinate and/or ethanol production. Actinobacillus sp. 130Z contained the key enzymes involved in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and the pentose-phosphate pathways and contained high levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, malic enzyme, and oxaloacetate decarboxylase. The levels of PEP carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase were significantly higher in Actinobacillus sp. 130Z than in Escherichia coli K-12 and accounted for the differences in succinate production. Key enzymes in end product formation in Actinobacillus sp. 130Z were regulated by the energy substrates.
