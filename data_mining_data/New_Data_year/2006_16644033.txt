BACKGROUND: The function and survival of pancreatic beta-cells strongly depend on glucose concentration and on autocrine secretion of peptide growth factors. NGF and its specific receptors TrkA and p75NTR play a pivotal role in islet survival and glucose-dependent insulin secretion. We therefore investigated whether or not glucose concentration influences expression of TrkA and p75NTR in rat islets and in INS-1E beta-cells at the mRNA and protein level (INS-1E). METHODS: Gene expression of the NGF receptors TrkA and p75NTR but also of the metabolic gene liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) and the neurotrophin receptors TrkB and TrkC was studied by semi-quantitative PCR and by real-time PCR in islets and INS-1E beta-cells. RESULTS: In rat islets, high glucose exposure (25 mmol/l) increased gene expression of TrkA, p75NTR and L-PK. Expression of TrkA, p75NTR and L-PK reflected insulin secretion at the respective glucose concentration. In rat INS-1E insulinoma cells, expression of L-PK and p75NTR was suppressed by low glucose as in the islets, while expression of TrkA was strongly increased by low glucose levels and thus was regulated differently than in islets. Expression of TrkB and TrkC was not regulated by glucose concentration at all. TrkA protein was regulated in the same fashion as its mRNA expression, while p75NTR protein was not significantly regulated within 24 h. CONCLUSION: Glucose interacts with gene expression of TrkA and p75NTR that are strongly involved in beta-cell growth and glucose-dependent insulin secretion. The fact that TrkA expression is regulated the opposite way in islets and in INS-1E beta-cells might reflect their specific grade of differentiation and tendency to proliferate.
