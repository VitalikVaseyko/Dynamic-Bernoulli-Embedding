We present the first proteomic analysis on the cellular responses to avian influenza virus (H9N2) infection in a human cell line in different time courses in order to search for target proteins for viral pathogenesis/adaptation studies. By using 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF MS and nano-ESI-MS/MS, we identified a set of differentially expressed cellular proteins, including cytoplasmic actin, cytokeratin, prohibitin, enoyl-CoA hydratase, peptide-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIase A), chloride intracellular channel protein 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, elongation factor 1-beta and splicing factor, arginine/serine rich 1. The most significant changes in different time courses were found in cytoplasmic actin and cytokeratin, both of which constituted the major components of cytoskeleton network in the cells. The obtained data suggested a possible role of the cytoskeleton during avian influenza virus infection of mammalian cells, which might help for better understanding of the dynamics of avian influenza virus and host interaction in mammalian cell setting.
