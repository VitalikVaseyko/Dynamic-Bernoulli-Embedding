A co-culture system of cerebellar granule cells (glutamatergic neurons) and hepatocytes has been developed. Petri dishes divided in halves by a temporary septum were coated with poly-L-lysine and cerebellar granule cells plated in one of the compartments. Five days later hepatocytes were plated in the other compartment and after 2 days the septum was removed and the two cell types shared the same culture medium for a period of 5 days. During this period of time cultures of neurons and hepatocytes kept separately or in co-culture exhibited identical characteristics with regard to activities of pyruvate kinase and glucokinase (hepatocytes), aspartate aminotransferase (neurons) as well as evoked transmitter release (neurons) and content of cytochrome P-450 (hepatocytes). The results show that it is possible to maintain neurons and hepatocytes in co-culture sharing the same culture medium for a prolonged period of time. Such a system may serve as a pharmacological model to study interactions between liver and brain cells with regard to neuroactive drugs.
