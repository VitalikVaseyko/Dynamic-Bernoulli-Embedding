Alterations in enzyme activities involved in muscle energy metabolism and the muscle fiber type distribution were investigated in six subjects, ranging in age from 19-23 years, following short-term, high intensity exercise. Changes in the vastus lateralis muscle were studied prior to exercise and approximately 24 h after each of 2 consecutive days of supramaximal cycling exercise (120% VO2 max) performed intermittently as 1-min work to 4-min rest until fatigue or until 24 repetitions had been completed. The results indicated that there were no changes (P greater than 0.05) in maximal in vitro activities for representative enzymes of beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HAD), the citric acid cycle (succinic dehydrogenase, SDH), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase, HK), glycogenolysis (total phosphorylase, PHOSPH), or glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, PFK; pyruvate kinase, PK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) in spite of the large increase in carbohydrate utilization and glycolytic flux rate. In addition, although no change in fiber type distribution was found in the pre-exercise biopsy between days, an acute reduction (P less than 0.05) in type I fiber distribution occurred with exercise. It is concluded that supramaximal exercise performed on a short-term basis does not alter the enzymatic profile or the fiber type distribution when measured 24 h following the activity.
