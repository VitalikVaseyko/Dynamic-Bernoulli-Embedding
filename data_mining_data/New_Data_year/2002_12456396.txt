The role played by ADP in modulating cross-bridge function has been difficult to study, because it is hard to buffer ADP concentration in skinned muscle preparations. To solve this, we used an analog of ADP, spin-labeled ADP (SL-ADP). SL-ADP binds tightly to myosin but is a very poor substrate for creatine kinase or pyruvate kinase. Thus ATP can be regenerated, allowing well-defined concentrations of both ATP and SL-ADP. We measured isometric ATPase rate and isometric tension as a function of both [SL-ADP], 0.1-2 mM, and [ATP], 0.05-0.5 mM, in skinned rabbit psoas muscle, simulating fresh or fatigued states. Saturating levels of SL-ADP increased isometric tension (by P'), the absolute value of P' being nearly constant, approximately 0.04 N/mm(2), in variable ATP levels, pH 7. Tension decreased (50-60%) at pH 6, but upon addition of SL-ADP, P' was still approximately 0.04 N/mm(2). The ATPase was inhibited competitively by SL-ADP with an inhibition constant, K(i), of approximately 240 and 280 microM at pH 7 and 6, respectively. Isometric force and ATPase activity could both be fit by a simple model of cross-bridge kinetics.
