The enzymatic syntheses of ATP analogs, such as tubercidin 5'-triphosphate, formycin A 5'-triphosphate, and etheno-ATP, from their respective mono- and diphosphate are described. The reaction products were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C-18 matrix and a volatile mobile phase at pH 7, with tributylamine as the ion-pairing agent. Each of the analogs required a buffer of somewhat different composition for the baseline separation of reaction product and reactants. The elutions were isocratic and allowed several successive runs without any intermediate equilibration of the column. After freeze-drying of the pooled fractions, the yield of the synthesized nucleoside triphosphate was approximately 70%. The described procedures are applicable either for analytical investigations or for semi-preparative purposes.
