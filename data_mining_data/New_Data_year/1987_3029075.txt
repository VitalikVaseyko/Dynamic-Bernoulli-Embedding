The energy requirement for protein translocation across membrane was studied with inverted membrane vesicles from an Escherichia coli strain that lacks all components of F1F0-ATPase. An ompF-lpp chimeric protein was used as a model secretory protein. Translocation of the chimeric protein into membrane vesicles was totally inhibited in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or valinomycin and nigericin and partially inhibited when either valinomycin or nigericin alone was added. Depletion of ATP with glucose and hexokinase resulted in the complete inhibition of the translocation process, and the inhibition was suppressed by the addition of ATP-generating systems such as phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase or creatine phosphate-creatine kinase. These results indicate that both the proton motive force and ATP are required for the translocation process. The results further suggest that both the membrane potential and the chemical gradient of protons (delta pH), of which the proton motive force is composed, participate in the translocation process.
