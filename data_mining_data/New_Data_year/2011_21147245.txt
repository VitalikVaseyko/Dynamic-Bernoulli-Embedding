As metabolism of motile fish sperm is not well understood, the current study examined the metabolism of saline-activated zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm. Activation of sperm with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (potassium cyanide, 2,4 dinitrophenol or carbonyl cyanide 3-cholorophenylhydrazone) negatively impacted sperm motility by 60-90 s postactivation. Incubation of quiescent sperm with 2,4 dinitrophenol prior to activation resulted in a 67% decrease in the percent motile sperm assessed 15s postactivation. Thus, production of ATP in quiescent sperm is important for motility upon activation and nascent ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation by motile sperm appears important at 60-90 s postactivation. Exposure of sperm to iodoacetamide, an inhibitor of creatine kinase, at activation was without effect. However, incubation of quiescent sperm with iodoacetamide prior to activation resulted in a 77% reduction in percent motile sperm and decreased velocity and wobble at 15s postactivation. These results suggest that creatine kinase and phosphocreatine shuttle are physiologically important at, or shortly after the initiation of motility. Finally, sperm were exposed to lactate, pyruvate, or acetate as well as to several monosaccharides upon activation. The results provided no evidence supporting any metabolic role of exogenous organics (potentially from the female via ovarian fluid) in sperm once motility has begun.
