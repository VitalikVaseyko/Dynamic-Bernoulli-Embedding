Under experimental myocardial ischemia in rats of 10 months treatment with mildronate resulted in essential changes in metabolism of cardiomyocites. This includes stimulation of aerobic and anaerobic ways of power supply of heart cells: activation of glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative pyruvate decarboxylation with restoration of adenosine triphosphate pool to intact rats level in myocardium, serum and erythrocytes with signs of stabilization of cardiomyocytes membranes and essential decrease of tissue hypoxia. Introduction of mildronate to old rats (24 months) with an experimental myocardium ischemia was accompanied by lesser expressed changes of metabolism: activation of glycolysis and oxidative pyruvate decarboxylation without stimulation of Crebs' cycle enzymes. This became sufficient for restoration of adenosine triphosphate pool in myocardium without change of its quantity in serum and erythrocytes with signs of stabilization of cardiomyocytes membranes and moderate reduction of tissue hypoxia degree.
