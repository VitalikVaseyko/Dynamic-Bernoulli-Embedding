Patients of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease frequently develop clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, we sought to determine global proteome alterations that distinguish ccRCC tissue from adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue in VHL-patients. Our quantitative proteomic analysis clearly discriminated tumor and non-malignant tissue. Significantly dysregulated proteins were distinguished using the linear models for microarray data algorithm. In the ccRCC tissue, we noticed a predominant under-representation of proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and an increase in proteins involved in glycolysis. This profile possibly represents a proteomic fingerprint of the "Warburg effect", which is a molecular hallmark of ccRCC. Furthermore, we observed an increase in proteins involved in extracellular matrix organization. We also noticed differential expression of many exoproteases in the ccRCC tissue. Of particular note were opposing alterations of Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidases-1 and -2 (XPNPEP-1 and -2): a strong decrease of XPNPEP-2 in ccRCC was accompanied by abundant presence of the related protease XPNPEP-1. In both cases, we corroborated the proteomic results by immunohistochemical analysis of ccRCC and adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue of VHL patients. To functionally investigate the role of XPNPEP-1 in ccRCC, we performed small-hairpin RNA mediated XPNPEP-1 expression silencing in 786-O ccRCC cells harboring a mutated VHL gene. We found that XPNPEP-1 expression dampens cellular proliferation and migration. These results suggest that XPNPEP-1 is likely an anti-target in ccRCC. Methodologically, our work further validates the robustness of using FFPE material for quantitative proteomics.
