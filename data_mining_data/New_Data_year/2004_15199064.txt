The skeletal muscle specific Ca(2)+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKIIbeta(M)) is localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by an anchoring protein, alphaKAP, but its function remains to be defined. Protein interactions of CaMKIIbeta(M) indicated that it exists in complex with enzymes involved in glycolysis at the SR membrane. The kinase was found to complex with glycogen phosphorylase, glycogen debranching enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and creatine kinase in the SR membrane. CaMKIIbeta(M) was also found to assemble with aldolase A, GAPDH, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphorylase b kinase from the cytosolic fraction. The interacting proteins were substrates of CaMKIIbeta(M), and their phosphorylation was enhanced in a Ca(2+)- and calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner. The CaMKIIbeta(M) could directly phosphorylate GAPDH and markedly increase ( approximately 3.4-fold) its activity in a Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent manner. These data suggest that the muscle CaMKIIbeta(M) isoform may serve to assemble the glycogen-mobilizing and glycolytic enzymes at the SR membrane and specifically modulate the activity of GAPDH in response to calcium signaling. Thus, the activation of CaMKIIbeta(M) in response to calcium signaling would serve to modulate GAPDH and thereby ATP and NADH levels at the SR membrane, which in turn will regulate calcium transport processes.
