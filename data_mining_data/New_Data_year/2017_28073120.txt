Nano-encapsulation of several natural products has become an important tool in enhancing the bioavailability of some modern drugs against many diseases. Pelargonidin is an anthocyanidin found in many fruits and vegetables. Pelargonidin is loaded with poly-lactide-co-glycolic-acid, a non-toxic biodegradable polymer, to produce nano-pelargonidin. Size, morphology, zeta potential, and planar uniformity of formulated nano-pelargonidin were determined by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The time required for cellular entry, folds of nano-pelargonidin, and drug encapsulation efficiency of poly-lactide-co-glycolic-acid were also ascertained. Relative functional efficacy of nano-pelargonidin and pelargonidin was evaluated by examining markers such as pyruvate kinase, glucokinase, calcium ion level, ATP/ADP ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release of mitochondrial cytochrome-c, and structural analysis of mitochondrial DNA in controlled and experimental sets of alloxan-induced hyperglycemic L6 cells. Expressions of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins, such as bcl2 and caspase3, and glucose signalling cascades, such as GLUT4, IRS1, IRS2, and PI3, were analyzed. Nano-pelargonidin at a nearly 10-fold reduced dose significantly enhanced protection, presumably due to its smaller size, ability of faster entry, and drug delivery at target-specific sites. Thus, nano-pelargonidin can be used in formulating protective drugs for therapeutic management of mitochondrial dysfunction often encountered in diabetic conditions.
