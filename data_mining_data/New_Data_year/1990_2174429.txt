Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) rapidly stimulated the production of lactate by hepatocytes isolated from fed rats. Our results indicate that enzymes of both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are involved in these actions. EGF stimulated CO2 release from the 1-position of glucose, and caused a small but significant increase in pyruvate kinase activity. In addition, EGF caused a rise in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations, indicating activation of phosphofructokinase. TPA did not alter the concentrations of these sugar phosphates, but did cause an increased lactate production and CO2 production from the 1-position of glucose similar to EGF. Furthermore, the EGF stimulation of lactate formation was independent of the presence of medium Ca2+. Phenylephrine stimulation of this process, in parallel incubations, was entirely dependent upon the presence of Ca2+ in the medium. We conclude that EGF stimulates glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats. The duplication of these actions by TPA suggests that protein kinase C is a mediator of EGF action in hepatocytes.
