The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and PDH kinase were measured in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of 4-week-gold thioglucose (GTG)-obese mice. The proportion of PDH complex in the active dephosphorylated form was 2-fold higher in BAT of post-absorptive obese mice compared with lean controls. This result was consistent with the higher circulating insulin concentration observed in GTG-obese mice. In both obese and lean mice the PDH-complex activity in BAT decreased after 24 h starvation and increased in response to supraphysiological insulin injection, indicating that the PDH complex is insulin-responsive in BAT of GTG-obese mice. There was no difference in the PDH kinase activity of BAT in post-absorptive or insulin-injected lean and obese mice, suggesting that the higher PDH-complex activity in obese mice was not due to decreased PDH kinase activity. There is no evidence for a decreased activity of PDH complex contributing to insulin resistance in BAT of 4-week-GTG-obese mice.
