The accurate determination of very low concentrations of ATP is important in many areas of pure and applied biochemistry, particularly hygiene monitoring in the food industry. Two mathematical models have been used to show that a luciferase-linked ATP recycling enzyme assay can determine sample ATP concentration from the time taken for observed bioluminescence to reach half its maximum value. Such a time-based assay has the potential to detect very low ATP concentrations in less than 10 min without the need for a sensitive photometer.
