Nine enzyme activity variants of liver/erythrocyte pyruvate kinase have been found amongst laboratory and wild mice. Four of these variants have been shown by biochemical and immunological criteria to be mutations of the structural gene, Pk-1s. These four structural gene mutations, and two regulatory gene mutations, define the gene complex, [Pk-1]. One allele of the structural gene, Pk-1sl, found in the inbred strain C57BL, has an unusual phenotype and affects the expression of pyruvate kinase in the liver but not erythrocyte. A possible mechanism for this tissue-specific structural gene mutation is suggested.
