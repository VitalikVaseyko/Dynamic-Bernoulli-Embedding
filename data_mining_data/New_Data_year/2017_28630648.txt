Microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel production. Microalgal metabolic pathways are heavily influenced by environmental factors. For instance, lipid metabolism can be induced by nitrogen-limiting conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms of lipid biosynthesis are unclear. In this study, we analyzed the global metabolic profiles of three genetically closely related Chlorella strains (C1, C2, and C3) with significant differences in lipid productivity to identify the contributions of key metabolic pathways to lipid metabolism. We found that nitrogen obtained from amino acid catabolism was assimilated via the glutamate-glutamine pathway and then stored as amino acids and intermediate molecules (particularly proline, alanine, arginine, succinate, and gamma-aminobutyrate) via the corresponding metabolic pathways, which led to carbon-nitrogen disequilibrium. Excess carbon obtained from photosynthesis or glycolysis was re-distributed into carbon-containing compounds, such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate, citrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and leucine, and then diverted into lipid metabolism for the production of storage lipids via the gamma-aminobutyrate pathway, glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These results were substantiated in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by analyzing various mutants deficient in glutamate synthase/NADH-dependent, glutamate synthase/Fd-dependent, glutamine synthetase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, and citrate synthase. Our study suggests that not only carbon but also nitrogen assimilation and distribution pathways contribute to lipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, these findings may facilitate genetic engineering efforts to enhance microalgal biofuel production.
