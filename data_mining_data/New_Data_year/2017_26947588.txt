AIMS: The regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in squamous cervical cancer (SCC) frequently use cisplatin combined with paclitaxel. Unfortunately, some cervical cancers show resistance to the principal chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment, decreasing the effectiveness of this therapy. The objective of this study was to search for predictive markers of response to NAC in patients with SCC. MAIN METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) accompanied by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to analyze and identify differentially expressed proteins in ten cases of advanced cervical cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based NAC. Each of these patients received more than two cycles of NAC. Cell proliferation rate in cisplatin resistant human cervical cancer cell Hela/DDP and its parent cell Hela after treatment with Hsp70 inhibitor and/or cisplatin were tested by MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Twelve protein spots changed in abundance, quantitative comparison of spot volumes showed that seven protein spots were up-regulated and five spots were down-regulated in the NAC non-responders compared to the NAC responders. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes essential for cell metabolism, migration and apoptotic signal transduction. The high-fold changes proteins of stathmin1, Hsp70 and pyruvate kinase isoform M2 were validated by Western blot analysis. Over-expression of Hsp70 inhibits the efficacy of cisplatin. Hsp70 inhibitor enhanced the sensitivity to cisplatin in both Hela and Hela/DDP cells. SIGNIFICANCE: The study found many candidate proteins involved in chemotherapy resistance/sensitivity, among them Hsp70 might be potential biomarkers to predict the efficacy of chemotherapy for SCC patients.
