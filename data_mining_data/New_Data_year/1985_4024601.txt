Forty four patients with various degrees of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) were studied. The activity of both dehydrogenases and pentosephosphate pathway (PPhP) in erythrocyte--glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), as well as the activity of the main generating ATP-enzyme of glycolysis--pyruvate kinase (PK) was studied. The activity of the erythrocyte enzymes studied grows with the intensification of renal insufficiency, particularly manifested in G6PD and PK.
