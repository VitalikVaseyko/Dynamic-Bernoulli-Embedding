Kinetic studies were carried out on the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate phosphotransferase, E.C. 2.7.1.40) purified from white striated (epaxial) muscle of two marine fish Mugil lisa (Brazilian mullet) and Chaetoditerus faber (harvest fish). This included the establishment of kinetic parameters. Attention was given to the effect of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-P2) on PK activity. Effects of ATP, alanine and the divalent ions, Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Be2+ and Co2+, on the fish muscle enzyme were also studied.
