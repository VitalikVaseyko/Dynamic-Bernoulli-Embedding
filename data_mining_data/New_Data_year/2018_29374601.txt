Multiple studies have shown that protein kinase Bbeta (AKT2) is involved in the development and progression of ovarian cancer, however, its precise role remains unclear. Here we explored the underlying molecular mechanisms how AKT2 promotes ovarian cancer progression. We examined the effects of AKT2 in vitro in two ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and HEY), and in vivo by metastasis assay in nude mice. The migration and invasion ability of SKOV3 and HEY cells was determined by transwell assay. Overexpression and knockdown (with shRNA) experiments were carried out to unravel the underlying signaling mechanisms induced by AKT2. Overexpression of AKT2 led to increased expression of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in ovarian cancer cells and in lung metastatic foci from nude mice. Elevated AKT2/PKM2 expression induced cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as lung metastasis in vivo; silencing AKT2 blocked these effects. Meanwhile, PKM2 overexpression was unable to increase AKT2 expression. The expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT2, and PKM2 were increased when stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF); however, these expressions were blocked when inhibited the PI3K by LY294002. STAT3 expression was elevated and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation was activated both in vitro and in vivo when either AKT2 or PKM2 was overexpressed; and these effects were inhibited when silencing AKT2 expression. Taken together, AKT2 increases the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and promotes lung metastasis in nude mice in vivo through PKM2-mediated elevation of STAT3 expression and NF-kappaB activation. In conclusion, we highlight a novel mechanism of the AKT2-PKM2-STAT3/NF-kappaB axis in the regulation of ovarian cancer progression, and our work suggested that both AKT2 and PKM2 may be potential targets for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
