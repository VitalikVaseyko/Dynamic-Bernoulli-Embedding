This review describes the recent experimental data on the importance of the VDAC-cytoskeleton interactions in determining the mechanisms of energy and metabolite transfer between mitochondria and cytoplasm in cardiac cells. In the intermembrane space mitochondrial creatine kinase connects VDAC with adenine nucleotide translocase and ATP synthase complex, on the cytoplasmic side VDAC is linked to cytoskeletal proteins. Applying immunofluorescent imaging and Western blot analysis we have shown that beta2-tubulin coexpressed with mitochondria is highly important for cardiac muscle cells mitochondrial metabolism. Since it has been shown by Rostovtseva et al. that alphabeta-heterodimer of tubulin binds to VDAC and decreases its permeability, we suppose that the beta-tubulin subunit is bound on the cytoplasmic side and alpha-tubulin C-terminal tail is inserted into VDAC. Other cytoskeletal proteins, such as plectin and desmin may be involved in this process. The result of VDAC-cytoskeletal interactions is selective restriction of the channel permeability for adenine nucleotides but not for creatine or phosphocreatine that favors energy transfer via the phosphocreatine pathway. In some types of cancer cells these interactions are altered favoring the hexokinase binding and thus explaining the Warburg effect of increased glycolytic lactate production in these cells.
