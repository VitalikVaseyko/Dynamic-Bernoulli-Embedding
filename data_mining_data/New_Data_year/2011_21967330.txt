Borrowing a method from the folk healers A. Omelchenko and R. Brois for the treatment of oncology patients, and having evaluated the positive results of their treatment method, the author explains and further substantiates this method using the concept of the Warburg effect. In addition, the effects on an organism of this treatment method were explored by the author on himself, and those outcomes are analyzed and described. Explanations of the mechanism of the presented method are provided from the points of view of biochemistry, physical chemistry, and biophysics, and also using the concept of the Warburg effect (most cancer cells predominantly produce energy by a high rate of glycolysis in the cytosol, rather than by a comparatively low rate of glycolysis followed by oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria like most normal cells). The increase in lactic acid production is the necessary endoergonic mechanism for accumulation of energy required for huge anabolic processes in glycolysis metabolism and enormous consumption of energy for anabolic processes in cancer tissue, i.e. lactic acids accumulate energy for anabolic processes in cancer tissue metabolism (see section II). Prolonged medical starvation (42-45 days) for treatment of oncologic patients was used in the presented method. Following an explanation of the distinctions between the Warburg effect and other medical targets for treatment of cancer, the author substantiates theoretically the possibility of a new method of cancer disease treatment. The presented method of cancer treatment is also described in detail. Evaluations of the mechanisms of activity of some of the medical targets that are used in modern methods are given, also using the Warburg effect mechanism. In addition, the author suggests possible modes to integrate the presented method of treatment for cancer with modern cancer treatment methods, and encourages their pursuit following detailed clinical trials.
