Trimetazidine (TMZ) is effective for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy; however, little is known about the effect of TMZ in established injury-induced heart failure. When rats with established infarct-induced heart failure were treated for 12 weeks with TMZ there was no effect on left ventricular function or dilation, or on mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes. On the other hand, TMZ significantly reduced atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels compared with untreated rats.
