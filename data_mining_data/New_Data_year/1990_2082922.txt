The regulation of metabolic pathways of the red cell affected by an enzyme deficiency is studied on the basis of comprehensive mathematical models. The main steps of such a theoretical approach are outlined considering individual alterations in the kinetic properties of two regulatory enzymes: pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. It is demonstrated that mathematical modelling helps to relate the observed changes of cellular quantities as shortened life-span, or as resistance against oxidative stress to alterations in the metabolic regulation.
