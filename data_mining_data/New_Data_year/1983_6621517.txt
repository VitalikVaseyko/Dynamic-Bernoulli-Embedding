Rat hepatocytes isolated by enzymatic dissociation of the liver must attach in order to survive for more than a few hours. In conventional culture conditions, they rapidly lose their highly differentiated functions, e.g. adult isozymic forms, enzyme response to specific hormones and cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase activities. Incompletely differentiated cells such as perinatal and regenerating hepatocytes, can transiently exhibit a more differentiated state. Therefore, regulation of hepatic functions, particularly enzyme activities cannot be studied for more than a few days. Hepatocyte survival rate and maintenance of specific functions are dependent on nutrient composition of the medium as well as the substrate. Complex matrices, particularly that derived from the connective liver biomatrix, appear to have an important favorable effect. However, regardless of culture conditions specific functions cannot be quantitatively maintained for more than several days. Recent observations strongly suggest that such a problem may be overcome by mimicking in vivo specific cell-cell interactions. Thus when co-cultured with a liver epithelial cell line, probably derived from biliary ductular cells, adult hepatocytes remain able to synthesize high levels of albumin and to conjugate drugs. In these conditions, the cells secrete an abundant heterogeneous extracellular material. The co-cultures can be maintained in a serum-free medium and specific liver functions can be altered experimentally. Such a model could be appropriate for studying long-term induction and modulation of liver enzyme activities under defined experimental conditions.
