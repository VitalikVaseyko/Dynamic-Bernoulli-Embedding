Nuclear magnetic resonance is a method which contributes nowadays to further investigations of the phosphate metabolism in red blood cells. By means of 31P nuclear magnetic resonance it is possible to record in intact red cells signals of phosphate compounds as well as changes in their concentrations. In the submitted work the authors followed up the important phosphate compounds in red cells--adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. They assessed and evaluated by statistical methods spectra of 10 healthy blood donors of different age and sex. The same procedure was used in 6 patients with hereditary spherocytosis, in 6 patients with G-6-PD deficiency and in 4 patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency. The most important changes were recorded in the latter pathological entity, the results being consistent with those obtained by other methods.
