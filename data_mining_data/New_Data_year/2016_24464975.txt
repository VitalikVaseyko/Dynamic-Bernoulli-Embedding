Bisphenol-A (BPA), one of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, is a male reproductive toxicant. Previous studies have revealed the direct cytotoxicity of BPA in many cultured cells, such as mitotic aneuploidy in embryonic cells and somatic cells, and apoptosis in neurons and testicular Sertoli cells. To understand the action of BPA and assess its risk, the Pten/Akt pathway was investigated in cultured Sertoli cells to elucidate the mechanism of the reproductive effects of BPA. The results showed that over 50 muM BPA treatment could decrease the viability of Sertoli cells and cause more apoptosis. In addition, BPA could induce the increase in mRNA levels of Pten and Akt. The protein level of Pten was increased; however, the protein levels of phospho-Akt and procaspase-3 were decreased after BPA exposure. Taken together, observed results suggested that the Pten/Akt pathway might be involved in the apoptotic effects of BPA on Sertoli cells.
