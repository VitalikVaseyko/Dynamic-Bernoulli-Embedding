This study tested the hypothesis that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays a role in regulating some aspects of metabolism in IMR-90 normal human fetal lung fibroblasts. Among the enzymes studied, only pyruvate kinase showed a significant increase after treatment of confluent-phase cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 at various concentrations (0.1-100 nM range) for 24 h. A parallel increase in lactate output was observed. Steroid specificity was established by the failure of 10 nM levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, estradiol-17 beta and progesterone to affect pyruvate kinase activity. The determination of the time course of [3H]-2-deoxy-D-glucose transport indicated that the hormone did not influence the transmembrane transport system of D-glucose. The addition of the inhibitors cycloheximide and actinomycin D to the culture medium abolished, at least in part, the 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulation of pyruvate kinase activity, suggesting the probable dependence of the hormone effect on cellular RNA and protein synthesis. 1,25(OH)2D3 also affected fibroblast growth and DNA synthesis. Cell number significantly decreased after 2-5 days treatment with 10 nM hormone in comparison with control fibroblasts, and also the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA decreased after treatment of the cells with 1 and 10 nM hormone for 48 h. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates pyruvate kinase activity in confluent-phase IMR-90 human fibroblasts by a mechanism probably dependent on de novo protein synthesis, and also affects cell growth and DNA synthesis in sub-confluent-phase cells.
