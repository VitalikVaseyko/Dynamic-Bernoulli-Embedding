Enzymes can be assayed by HPLC by calculating the amount of substrate(s) left over, or product formed, through the peak area ratios with a suitable internal standard. However, sometimes the substrates used are contaminated with small amounts of products and this can lead to errors in the determination of the enzyme activity. A method for a HPLC test of such enzymes, which prevents eventual errors, uses the ratio substrate/product at time zero as internal standard and the kinetics can be followed with the aid of a simple mathematical equation. This approach was applied to the determination of the activities of papain, urokinase, NAD glycohydrolase, and pyruvate kinase samples and it was compared with the data obtained by the internal standard method, giving reproducible results in all cases.
