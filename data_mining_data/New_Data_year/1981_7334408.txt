The activities of enolase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase were measured in cerebrospinal fluid of 121 patients presenting with a range of disorders of the central nervous system. The results from 41 patients undergoing myelography were used as controls. An assessment was made of the relative merits of these five enzymes as markers of brain damage with special reference to brain tumours. Enolase was the most sensitive marker of pathological change and was the only enzyme raised in the CSF of patients with low grade astrocytomas.
