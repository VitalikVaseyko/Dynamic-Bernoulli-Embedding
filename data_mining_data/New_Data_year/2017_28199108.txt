Libraries of nonpurified resorcinol amide derivatives were screened by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine the binding dissociation constant (off-rate, kd) for compounds binding to the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) enzyme. Parallel off-rate measurements against HSP90 and application of structure-based drug design enabled rapid hit to lead progression in a program to identify pan-isoform ATP-competitive inhibitors of PDHK. Lead optimization identified selective sub-100-nM inhibitors of the enzyme which significantly reduced phosphorylation of the E1alpha subunit in the PC3 cancer cell line in vitro.
