Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human cancers. Genomic analyses define the molecular architecture of GBM and highlight a central function for mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. mTOR kinase exists in two multi-protein complexes, namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2. These complexes differ in terms of function, regulation and rapamycin sensitivity. mTORC1 is well established as a cancer drug target, whereas the functions of mTORC2 in cancer, including GBM, remains poorly understood. This study reviews the recent findings that demonstrate a central function of mTORC2 in regulating tumor growth, metabolic reprogramming, and targeted therapy resistance in GBM, which makes mTORC2 as a critical GBM drug target.
