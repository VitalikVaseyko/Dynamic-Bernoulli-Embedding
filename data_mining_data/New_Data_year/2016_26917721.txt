It has been recognized that the rate-limiting function of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in glycolysis plays an important role in distributing glycolytic intermediates for anabolic and catabolic purposes in cancer cells. However, after analysis of the catalytic capacity of PKM2 relative to other glycolytic enzymes, the regulation range of PKM2 activity, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics, we suggest that the PKM2-catalyzed reaction is not a rate-limiting step in cancer cell glycolysis. Hexokinase and phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), the first and third enzyme along the pathway, are rate-limiting enzymes that limit the overall glycolytic rate, whereas PKM2 and lactate dehydrogenase, the last two enzymes in the pathway, are for the fast removal of upstream intermediates to prevent the obstruction of the pathway. The argument is in accordance with the catalytic capacity of glycolytic enzymes, regulation range of enzyme activities, metabolic flux control, and thermodynamics.
