Rabbit sperm pyruvate kinase remains bound to the cell structure of hypotonically treated mature rabbit epididymal spermatozoa (HTRES). It displays kinetic behavior very similar to that of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase with regard to KM values for substrates, activation by monovalent and divalent cations, inhibition by phenylalanine which is reversed by alanine, and lack of activation by fructose-1,6-biphosphate. The flagellar ATPase also remains bound to the cell structure of HTRES, whose motility may be reactivated by a source of ATP. It requires Mg+2 for activity; the KM for both ATP and MG+2 is 0.2 mM, implying that MgATP is the substrate. The ATPase activity is not inhibited by ouabain, oligomycin, or vanadate, which also do not affect reconstituted motility, and is not affected by cyclic AMP in the presence of an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. The activities of pyruvate kinase and the flagellar ATPase in a given preparation of HTRES are comparable. Rabbit spermatozoa have a metabolic strategy which is very similar to muscle cells. This suggests that the major use of the sperm cell's metabolic machinery is maintenance of energy for the contractile work of motility and that only minor amounts of metabolic energy appear to be consumed in other reactions, including those involved in fertilization.
