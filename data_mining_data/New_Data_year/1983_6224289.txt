Pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) erythrocyte deficiencies induced by chemotherapy were studied in 6 patients. From immunological tests it may be assumed that the PK and PFK deficiencies were due to different direct mechanisms: a disturbance of the synthesis of one of the PFK subunit; mutation(s) in the structural gene of PK which result in the synthesis of mutant proteins. Several molecular mechanisms are probably at the origin of all the disturbances induced by chemotherapy in the red blood cells. The study of these alterations which mimic those detected in preleukaemic and leukaemic states, provides information on the molecular events in the possible production of chemo-induced cancers.
