Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in crude extracts of muscle has frequently been determined by using a continuous spectrophotometric method, which is shown to grossly overestimate enzyme activity. NADH oxidation attributed to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in the assay is due to lactate production. Under the normal assay conditions. Na+ ions stimulate pyruvate kinase, providing pyruvate for lactate formation by lactate dehydrogenase and sufficiently to account for most of the observed NADH oxidation.
