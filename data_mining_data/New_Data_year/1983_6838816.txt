Phosphoenolpyruvate when heated in acidic solution exchanges its phosphoryl and carboxyl oxygens rapidly and its enolic oxygen much more slowly with oxygens from water. The incorporation of 18O into phosphoenolpyruvate was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance after heating in H218O at 98 degrees C. The rates of exchange of all six oxygens of phosphoenolpyruvate with water increase with increasing acidity, and the phosphoryl oxygens exchange more rapidly than the carboxyl oxygens. The rate of exchange of each oxygen of the phosphoryl group is 16-fold greater than the hydrolysis rate at 1 N HCl. This provides a simple and useful method for the synthesis of [18O]phosphoenolpyruvate highly enriched in its phosphoryl-group oxygens. An enrichment of 89% was obtained with a 50% yield. The [18O]-phosphoenolpyruvate showed a binomial distribution of 18O in the phosphoryl-group oxygens. The exchange may be explained by the reversible formation of a transient cyclic phosphate and, for exchange of the enolic oxygen, a transient acyl phosphate. Preparation of [18O]phosphoenolypyruvate from [18O]Pi by a chemical synthesis from beta-chlorolactate was not satisfactory because of drastic loss of 18O during the procedures used. Some loss of 18O also occurred during an enzymic synthesis with KCNO, [18O]Pi, carbamate kinase, and pyruvate kinase.
