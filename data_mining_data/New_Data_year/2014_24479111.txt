The identification of various fecal biomarkers has provided insight into the intestinal milieu. Most of these markers are associated with the innate immune system of the gut, apart from the more novel M2-pyruvate kinase. The innate immunity of the gut plays a role in maintaining a fine balance between tolerance to commensal bacteria and immune response to potential pathogens. It is a complex system, which comprises of multiple elements, including antimicrobial peptides (e.g., defensins, cathelicidins, lactoferrin, and osteoprotegerin), inflammatory proteins (e.g., calprotectin and S100A12), and microbial products (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). Dysfunction of any component can lead to the development of intestinal disease, and different diseases have been associated with different fecal levels of these biomarkers. Each fecal biomarker provides information on specific biological and disease processes. Therefore, stool quantification of these biomarkers provides a non-invasive method to define potential pathways behind the pathogenesis of diseases and can assist in the assessment and diagnosis of various gastrointestinal conditions. The abovementioned fecal biomarkers and their role in intestinal health and disease will be reviewed in this paper with a pediatric focus.
