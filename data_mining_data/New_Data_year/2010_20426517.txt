Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can lead to acute hemolytic anemia, chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, and neonatal jaundice. Neonatal red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency may cause clinical patterns, ranging from extremely severe hemolytic anemia to moderate jaundice. The authors aimed at studying the prevalence of G6PD and PK deficiency among Egyptian neonates with pathological indirect hyperbilirubinemia in Cairo. This case-series study included 69 newborns with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. All were subjected to clinical history, laboratory investigations, e.g., complete blood counts, reticulocytic counts, direct and indirect serum bilirubin levels, Coombs tests, qualitative assay of G6PD activity by methemoglobin reduction test, and measurement of erythrocytic PK levels. The study detected 10 neonates with G6PD deficiency, which means that the prevalence of G6PD deficiency among Egyptian neonates with hyperbilirubinemia is 14.4% (21.2% of males). G6PD deficiency was significantly higher in males than females (P = .01). The authors detected 2 cases with PK deficiency, making the prevalence of its deficiency 2.8%. These data demonstrate that G6PD deficiency is an important cause for neonatal jaundice in Egyptians. Neonatal screening for its deficiency is recommended. PK deficiency is not a common cause of neonatal jaundice. However, this needs further investigation on a larger scale.
