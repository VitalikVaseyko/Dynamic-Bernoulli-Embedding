Estrogen-dependent mammary gland tumors, induced in rats by DMBA, were found to show a high content of estradiol receptors. Among hormone-dependent tumors there were ones both with low and high content of the receptors. Loss of estrogen dependence by tumors with a high level of estradiol receptors is due to an impairment of the translocation of estradiol-receptor complexes into nuclei. Only in estrogen-dependent tumors the activity of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and glucoso-6-phosphatedehydrogenase was changed following ovariectomy and administration of estradiol to the animals.
