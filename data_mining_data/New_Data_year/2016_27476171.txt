MicroRNAs play an important role in tumor development and progression. Tumor growth is closely associated with glucose metabolism. Specifically, tumor cells produce energy (ATP) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions through glycolysis and metabolites, such as lactic acid and ATP, as a result of the Warburg effect. However, the transport of glucose into cells depends on protein transporters in the cell membrane. Therefore, this area has recently become a topic of interest for research on targeted cancer therapy. We found that miRNA-451 inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway to modify the biological behavior of glioma cells. Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway may prevent glucose-addicted cancer cells from performing glycolysis. Akt directly affects glycolysis by regulating the localization of the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). However, how miRNA-451 regulates glucose transporters on the cell membrane and affects the regulatory mechanisms of glucose metabolism in glioma cells remains unclear. Consequently, we predict and verify related gene protein interactions. By targeting CAB 39, miRNA-451 likely triggers the LKB1/AMPK/PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulates GLUT1, to inhibit the glucose metabolism of, reduce the energy supply to, and inhibit the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells. Our results suggest a new direction for the treatment of glioma.
