In the past decade mitochondria have emerged as an important cellular signaling hub controlling metabolism, epigenetics, and cell fate. Dysfunctional mitochondria initiate a retrograde nuclear response that influences the cellular reprograming observed in various human pathologies, including cancer. New data suggest that loss of cytochrome c oxidase function promotes the Warburg effect and upregulates several genes with roles in tumor development.
