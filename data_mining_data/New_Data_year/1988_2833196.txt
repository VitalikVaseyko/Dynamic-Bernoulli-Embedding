Some enzymatic activities of the glycolytic and hexose monophosphate pathways of Candida parapsilosis, a yeast lacking alcohol dehydrogenase but able to grow on high glucose concentrations, were compared to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells were grown either on 8% glucose or on 2% glycerol and activities measured under optimal conditions. Results were as follows: glycolytic enzymes of C. parapsilosis, except glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibited an activity weaker than that of S. cerevisiae, especially when yeasts were grown on glycerol. Fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase, an enzyme implicated in gluconeogenesis and in the hexose monophosphate pathway, and known to be very sensitive to catabolite repression in S. cerevisiae, was always active in C. parapsilosis even when cells were grown on 8% glucose. However, the allosteric properties towards AMP and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate were the same in both strains. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, two other enzymes of the hexose monophosphate pathway, exhibited a higher activity in C. parapsilosis than in S. cerevisiae. Regulation of two important control points of the glycolytic flux, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, was investigated. In C. parapsilosis phosphofructokinase was poorly sensitive to ATP but fructose-2,6-bisphosphate completely relieved the light ATP inhibition. Pyruvate kinase did not require fructose-1,6-bisphosphate for its activity, and by this way, did not regulate the glycolytic flux.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
