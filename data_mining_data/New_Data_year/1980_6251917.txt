Penicillium janthinellum is able to grow on glycine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. The amino acid is transaminated to glyoxylate which is further metabolised to pyruvate by the glycerate pathway. The reaction product of partially purified glycerate kinase from this fungus is 2-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycerate mutase initiates gluconeogenesis from glycine. Partially purified phosphoglycerate mutase is inhibited by fructose 6-phosphate. The possible significance of this regulation is discussed.
