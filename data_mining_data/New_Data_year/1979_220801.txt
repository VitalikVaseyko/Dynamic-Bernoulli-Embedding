The ratio of two substrates (pyruvate and lactate), activity of enzymes, responsible for their turnover in liver tissue, sceletal muscles and blood, were studied simultaneously in experiments on the effect of hydroxythiamin, which was administered at doses, causing a state of hypovitaminosis B1. Hydroxythiamin was shown to inhibit specifically the activity of thiamin-dependent enzymes (transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase). It affected also the metabolism of triose phosphates, pyruvate and lactate. At the same time, hydroxythiamin was responsible for changes in activities of other enzymes, participating in turnover of the substrates studied.
