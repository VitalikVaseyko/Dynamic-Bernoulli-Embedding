BACKGROUND: The currently available tumour markers used in the management of patients with colorectal metastases are of limited value. Tumour M2-pyruvate kinase (TuM2-PK), a tumour-associated isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase, is elevated in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This study has measured TuM2-PK levels in patients before and after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with CLM and no local residual disease had TuM2-PK levels measured before liver resection. In 20 patients, TuM2-PK levels were repeated at 2 weeks, 5 weeks and 5 months after resection. Plasma levels were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ScheBo, Giessen, Germany). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 levels were measured at the same time periods by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. CEA, CA19-9 and TuM2-PK levels were compared with the tumour number, volume, differentiation and stage. Cut-off values used for TuM2-PK, CEA and CA19-9 were 15 IU/ml, 10 ng/ml and 39 IU/ml, respectively. RESULTS: TuM2-PK was elevated in 68%, CEA in 62% and CA19-9 in 40% of patients with CLM. TuM2-PK+CEA was elevated in 88% and TuM2-PK+CA19-9 in 78% of patients. A significant correlation was observed between tumour volume and CEA (r=0.34, P<0.05) and CA19-9 (r=0.49, P<0.005). TuM2-PK levels did not show a significant correlation with tumour differentiation, volume or the number of metastases. At 2 weeks after liver resection, CEA and CA19-9 levels had decreased to normal value in 73 and 67% of patients, respectively, but TuM2-PK remained elevated in all patients. At 5 weeks, TuM2-PK, CEA and CA19-9 levels decreased to normal in 64, 93 and 70% of patients, respectively, and at 5 months levels were normal in 58, 92 and 67%. CONCLUSION: Plasma TuM2-PK is commonly elevated in patients with CLM. Levels do not correlate with tumour volume, number or differentiation. Levels remain elevated after liver resection, the cause of which requires further investigation.
