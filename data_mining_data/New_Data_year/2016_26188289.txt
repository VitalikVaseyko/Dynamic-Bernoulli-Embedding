In order for Candida species to adhere and colonize human host cells they must express cell wall proteins (CWP) and adapt to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by phagocytic cells of the human host during the respiratory burst. However, how these pathogens change the expression of CWP in response to oxidative stress (OSR) is not known. Here, fifteen moonlight-like CWP were identified that expressed differentially in four species of Candida after they were exposed to H2O2 or menadione (O2(-)). These proteins included: (i) glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1), phosphoglycerate mutase (Gpm1), phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), pyruvate kinase (Pk) and enolase (Eno1); (ii) the heat shock proteins Ssb1 and Ssa2; (iii) OSR proteins such as peroxyredoxin (Tsa1), the stress protein Ddr48 (Ddr48) and glutathione reductase (Glr1); (iv) other metabolic enzymes such as ketol-acid reductoisomerase (Ilv5) and pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1); and (v) other proteins such as elongation factor 1-beta (Efb1) and the 14-3-3 protein homolog. RT-PCR revealed that transcription of the genes coding for some of the identified CWP are differentially regulated. To our knowledge this is the first report showing that moonlight-like CWP are the first line of defense of Candida against ROS, and that they are differentially regulated in each of these pathogens.
