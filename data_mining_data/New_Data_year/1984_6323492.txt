P-815 mastocytoma cells increase the level of pyruvate kinase (PK) expression in response to chloroform-methanol extracts of conditioned media, butyrate, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (but2cAMP) plus theophylline. The butyrate effect is indomethacin sensitive, suggesting a prostaglandin (PG) is the active signaling factor. Moreover, the chloroform-methanol extracts contain PGE2 and PGF2 alpha and additions of the latter enhance PK activity. PGE2 alone has little or no effect but acts synergistically with PGF2 alpha. These data show that PGF2 alpha can regulate PK levels. On the other hand, other factors may also be active, since the endogeneous and the but2cAMP plus theophylline effects are indomethacin insensitive. Most of the factors that increase PK activity also inhibit cellular growth; however, regulation of PK expression can be uncoupled from growth inhibition.
