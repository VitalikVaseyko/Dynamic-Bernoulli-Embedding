Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate-like 1 (MARCKSL1) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis and has been shown to maintain antitumor and metastasis-suppressive properties. In the present study, we examined the effects of MARCKSL1 as a novel anti-angiogenic agent on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell migration. MARCKSL1 also reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, as well as capillary-like tubular structure formation in vitro. MARCKSL1 disrupted phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in ovarian tumorigenesis. In addition, MARCKSL1 showed potent anti-angiogenic activity and reduced the levels of VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression, an essential regulator of angiogenesis. Consistently, MARCKSL1 decreased VEGFinduced phosphorylation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway components, including phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC-2), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) protein. Collectively, our results provide evidence for the physiological/biological function of an endothelial cell system involved in angiogenesis through suppression of Akt/PDK-1/mTOR phosphorylation by interaction with VEGFR-2.
