The use of energy restriction mimetic agents (ERMAs) to selectively target cancer cells addicted to glycolysis could be a promising therapeutic approach. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are synthetic agonists of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma that were developed to treat type II diabetes. These compounds also display anticancer effects which appear mainly to be independent of their PPARgamma agonist activity but the molecular mechanisms involved in the anticancer action are not yet well understood. Results obtained on ciglitazone derivatives, mainly in prostate cancer cell models, suggest that these compounds could act as ERMAs. In the present paper, we introduce how compounds like 2-deoxyglucose target the Warburg effect and then we discuss the possibility that the PPARgamma-independent effects of various TZD could result from their action as ERMAs.
