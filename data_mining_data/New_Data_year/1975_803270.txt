The specific activity of a peroxisomal enzyme, lactate oxidase, and of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which are not peroxisomal, increased rapidly when shaken cultures of Tetrahymena were transferred to conditions of oxygen restriction and supplemented with glucose. Two other peroxisomal enzymes, catalase and TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, did not increase substantially, nor did succinate dehydrogenase. The increases were reduced if glucose was not added at the time of transfer, and were prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, but not by chloramphenicol. The results suggest an involvement of peroxisomes in the metabolism of glycolytic endproducts when the availability of oxygen to the cell is limiting.
