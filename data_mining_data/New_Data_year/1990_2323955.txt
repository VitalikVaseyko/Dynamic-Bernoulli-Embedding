The distribution patterns of the enzyme activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase and malic enzyme were determined in the liver acini of men and women by microquantitative means. The activity of PEPCK was higher in men compared to the activity in women. In both sexes no heterotopic distribution pattern was observed. PK activity of men was higher, but in both sexes no heterotopic distribution was detectable. G6PDH and ME showed relatively low activity. The distribution of G6PDH and ME activity was to some extent different in men and women. Yet their heterotopic patterns were not particularly distinct.
