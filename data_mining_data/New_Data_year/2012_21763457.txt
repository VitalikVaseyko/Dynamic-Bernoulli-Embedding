The protein kinase Cdelta signalosome modulates the generation of acetyl-Coenzyme A from glycolytic sources. This module is composed of four interlinked components: PKCdelta, the signal adapter p66Shc, cytochrome c, and vitamin A. It resides in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and is at the center of a feedback loop that senses upstream the redox balance between oxidized and reduced cytochrome c as a measure of the workload of the respiratory chain, and transmits a forward signal to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to adjust the flux of fuel entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The novel role of vitamin A as co-activator and potential electron carrier, required for redox activation of PKCdelta, is discussed.
