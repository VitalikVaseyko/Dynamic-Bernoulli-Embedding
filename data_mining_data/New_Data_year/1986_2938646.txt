The genetic locus designated Dpg has two alleles in outbred Long-Evans rats. Genotype at this locus affects quantities of red cell 2,3- diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and adenosine triphosphate, as well as activities of two important glycolytic enzymes: phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Intravascular red cell survival is shortened in low-DPG animals. In order to get closer to the specific action of this locus, we addressed the question of whether the Dpg gene acts through intracorpuscular or extracorpuscular factors. Bone marrow transplantation after total body irradiation and 51Cr red cell survival after cross transfusion were the methods used. Because the animals that were used differed in hemoglobin phenotype, donor and recipient cells could be quantified in cross-transplanted animals. Phenotypic markers of Dpg genotype were measured in animals 40 to 50 days after transplantation. Values for these markers correlated highly with the percentage of donor and recipient cells present. In vivo survival of low-DPG red cells was significantly shorter than that of high-DPG cells (P less than .05), regardless of the genotype of the recipient. From the present studies, we conclude that the action of the Dpg gene is exerted by an intracorpuscular factor.
