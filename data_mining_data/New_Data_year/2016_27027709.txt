OBJECTIVE: To compare mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of fibroblasts from Doberman Pinschers with and without dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and mutation of the gene for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) and to evaluate in vitro whether treatment with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (i.e., gene therapy) would alter metabolic efficiency. ANIMALS: 10 Doberman Pinschers screened for DCM and PDK4 mutation. PROCEDURES Fibroblasts were harvested from skin biopsy specimens obtained from Doberman Pinschers, and dogs were classified as without DCM or PDK4 mutation (n = 3) or with occult DCM and heterozygous (4) or homozygous (3) for PDK4 mutation. Fibroblasts were or were not treated with tyrosine mutant AAV type 2 vector containing PDK4 at multiplicities of infection of 1,000. Mitochondrial OCR was measured to evaluate mitochondrial metabolism. The OCR was compared among dog groups and between untreated and treated fibroblasts within groups. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD basal OCR of fibroblasts from heterozygous (74 +/- 8 pmol of O2/min) and homozygous (58 +/- 12 pmol of O2/min) dogs was significantly lower than that for dogs without PDK4 mutation (115 +/- 9 pmol of O2/min). After AAV transduction, OCR did not increase significantly in any group (mutation-free group, 121 +/- 26 pmol of O2/min; heterozygous group, 88 +/- 6 pmol of O2/min; homozygous group, 59 +/- 3 pmol of O2/min). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mitochondrial function was altered in skin fibroblasts of Doberman Pinschers with DCM and PDK4 mutation. Change in mitochondrial function after in vitro gene therapy at the multiplicities of infection used in this study was not significant.
