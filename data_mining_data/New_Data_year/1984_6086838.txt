We examined the patterns of cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation in membranes prepared from rat cortical synaptosomes following gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. We determined the optimum pH (6.2), time (20 s), Mg2+ concentration (10 mM) and cyclic AMP concentration (5 microM) for the reaction. We also found that the detergents Triton X-100 and gramicidin S enhanced cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Inhibitors of the Na+, K+ ATPase (ouabain, NaF, vanadate) enhanced protein phosphorylation. This effect occurred in the presence but not in the absence of detergent. The addition of purified bovine brain cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit enhanced membrane protein phosphorylation. The addition of homogeneous neural (bovine brain) and non-neural (bovine skeletal muscle) cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase type II regulatory subunit partially inhibited protein phosphorylation. Both neural and non-neural regulatory subunits behaved similarly. In addition to cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, the alpha-subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Mr = 41,000) is phosphorylated in a cyclic AMP-independent fashion. We also examined the phosphorylation pattern of membranes prepared from rat heart and found that the number of acceptor substrates was much less than that from the nervous system.
