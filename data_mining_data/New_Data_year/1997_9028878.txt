Cleavage of tubulin at tryptophan residues yielded several peptides, one of which strongly interacted with aldolase as determined by inhibition of aldolase activity. This peptide was identified as the C-terminal, residues 408-451, of the alpha-subunit of tubulin. Peptides with identical sequences to the C-terminal regions of the alpha- and beta-subunits of tubulin were synthesized to further characterize interactions with glycolytic enzymes. A 43-amino-acid C-terminal peptide from alpha-tubulin (residues 409-451) was found to have binding properties similar to those of native tubulin and was designated the tubulin glycolytic enzyme binding domain (T-GEBD-43mer).
