1. The effect on oxygen evolution of Chlorella vulgaris produced by light intensities up to about 40,000 f.-c. has been studied by the use of the Warburg technique. 2. Above a certain critical intensity, which is determined by the previous history of the cells, the rate of oxygen evolution decreases from the maximum to another constant rate. This depression is at first a completely reversible effect. 3. With a sufficiently high intensity this constant rate represents an oxygen uptake greater than the rate of dark respiration. During such a constant rate of oxygen uptake a progressive injury to the photosynthetic mechanism takes place. After a given oxygen consumption the rate falls off, approaching zero, and the cells are irreversibly injured. 4. The constant rate of oxygen evolution (2 and 3) decreases in a continuous manner with increasing light intensities, approaching a value which is approximately constant for all lots of cells regardless of previous history. 5. Two alternative hypotheses have been presented to explain the observed phenomena. The more acceptable of these proposes quick inactivation of the photosynthetic mechanism, the extent of inhibition depending on the light intensity. 6. In Chlorella vulgaris solarization is influenced by the previous history of the cells.
