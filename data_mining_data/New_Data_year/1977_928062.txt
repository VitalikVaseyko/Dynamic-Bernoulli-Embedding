A rapid, simple and inexpensive procedure is described for the preparation of purine ribo-and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates specifically and highly radiolabeled with [32P]phosphate in the beta position. The method involves two successive enzymatic reactions: conversion of donor [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of an excess of acceptor 5'-mononucleotide to the 5'-diphosphates by myokinase or guanosine 5'-monophosphate kinase followed by phosphorylation with pyruvate kinase to yield 5'-triphosphates.
