Glycolysis is linked to the rapid response of memory CD8(+) T cells, but the molecular and subcellular structural elements enabling enhanced glucose metabolism in nascent activated memory CD8(+) T cells are unknown. We found that rapid activation of protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) led to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions. This enabled recruitment of hexokinase I (HK-I) to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on mitochondria. Binding of HK-I to VDAC promoted respiration by facilitating metabolite flux into mitochondria. Glucose tracing pinpointed pyruvate oxidation in mitochondria, which was the metabolic requirement for rapid generation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in memory T cells. Subcellular organization of mTORC2-AKT-GSK3beta at mitochondria-ER contact sites, promoting HK-I recruitment to VDAC, thus underpins the metabolic reprogramming needed for memory CD8(+) T cells to rapidly acquire effector function.
