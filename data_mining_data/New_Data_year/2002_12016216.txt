A high carbohydrate diet up-regulates the transcription of enzymes of triglyceride biosynthesis (lipogenesis) in the mammalian liver. This treatment stimulates hepatic insulin signaling, leading to transcription of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). SREBP-1c has been implicated as a major factor that up-regulates lipogenic genes in response to carbohydrate feeding. However, we presented evidence for another factor, carbohydrate response factor, which is also involved in this response, and we proposed a model wherein SREBP-1c and carbohydrate response factor are independent transcription factors that act in response to insulin and glucose, respectively. In this study, we examined the contribution of SREBP-1c to the expression of lipogenic genes in glucose- and insulin-treated primary rat hepatocytes using an inducible adenovirus system. We found that SREBP-1c overexpression leads to a modest induction of fatty acid synthase, S(14), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNAs to 20% (fatty acid synthase), 10% (S(14)), and 5% (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) of the induction seen by high glucose and insulin treatment. Restoring insulin to cells overexpressing SREBP-1c did not further increase these mRNA levels. In contrast, adenovirus-expressed SREBP-1c did not induce pyruvate kinase mRNA, suggesting that induction of this gene is SREBP-1c-independent. SREBP-1c does indeed play a role in the induction of lipogenic enzyme genes in response to insulin treatment, but it is not sufficient for the induction seen when hepatocytes are treated with insulin and high glucose.
