The mode of action of lithium in prophylaxis of recurrent affective disorder is unknown although it has been suggested that lithium might compete with magnesium in magnesium dependent processes. We have previously shown pyruvate kinase to be inhibited by lithium and the present study demonstrates a small inhibition by lithium of phosphofructokinase that is also a major regulatory step in glycolysis. Inhibition of PFK was competitive with respect to ATP and magnesium and noncompetitive with respect to potassium and fructose-6-phosphate. Inhibition was enhanced at reduced concentrations of magnesium.
