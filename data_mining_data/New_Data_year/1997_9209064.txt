An interaction between the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase Mck1 and pyruvate kinase (Pyk1) was detected by using the two-hybrid method. Purified Mck1 was able to phosphorylate purified Pyk1 on Ser in vitro. Pyruvate kinase activity was elevated in mck1 delta cells. Several of the phenotypes of mck1 delta mutants are similar to those observed in cells overexpressing PYK1. Co-overexpression of MCK1 suppressed all of the phenotypes associated with PYK1 overexpression. These results indicate that Mck1 negatively regulates pyruvate kinase activity, possibly by direct phosphorylation.
