The decarboxylation of oxalacetate shows equilibrium-ordered kinetics, with Mg2+ adding before oxalacetate. The Ki for Mg2+ increases below a pK of 6.9, corresponding to a ligand of the metal that is probably glutamate, and decreases above a pK of 9.2, corresponding to water coordinated to enzyme-bound Mg2+. Both V and V/KOAA decrease above the pK of 9.2, suggesting that the carbonyl oxygen of oxalacetate must replace water in the inner coordination sphere of Mg2+ prior to decarboxylation. The enzyme-Mg2+-oxalacetate complex must be largely an outer sphere one, however, since the pK of 9.2 is seen in the V profile. The phosphorylation of glycolate or N-hydroxycarbamate (the actual substrate that results from reaction of hydroxylamine with bicarbonate) occurs only above the pK of 9.2, with V/K profiles decreasing below this pH. The alkoxides of these substrates appear to be the active species, replacing water in the coordination sphere of Mg2+ prior to phosphorylation by MgATP. Glycolate, but not N-hydroxycarbamate, can bind when not an alkoxide, since the V profile for the former decreases below a pK of 8.9, while V for the latter is pH independent. Initial velocity patterns for phosphorylation of fluoride in the presence of bicarbonate show saturation by MgATP but not by fluoride. The V/K profile for fluoride decreases above the pK of 9.0, showing that fluoride must replace water in the coordination sphere of Mg2+ prior to phosphorylation. None of the above reactions is sensitive to the protonation state of the acid-base catalyst that assists the enolization of pyruvate in the physiological reaction.
