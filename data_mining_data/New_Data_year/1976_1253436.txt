We evaluated a new enzymatic kit for serum triglycerides (triacylglycerols) in two laboratories. The procedure involved both enzymatic hydrolysis of the triglycerides and conversion of the glycerol, which was linked to an indicator reaction. There was excellent agreement with the mechanized procedure of Kessler and Lederer and with a manual method. The test requires 50 mul of serum and can be completed in about 50 min. Inter- and intra-laboratory variation, linearity, accuracy, and specimen storage were studied.
