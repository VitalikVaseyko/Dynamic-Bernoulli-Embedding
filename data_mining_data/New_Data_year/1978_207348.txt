Interaction of several enzymes (pyruvate kinase, myokinase, creatine kinase, aldolase, malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and other proteins (bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin) with Blue Dextran was studied by means of affinity electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. A decrease of electrophoretic mobility of enzymes in affinity gels was dependent on Blue Dextran concentration and in some cases, dissociation constants of the protein-immobilized dye complexes could be calculated. Affinity electrophoresis in the presence of Blue Dextran reveals in some cases additional bands of isoenzymes, as compared with the control gels (without Blue Dextran).
