As a corollary to the metabolite data obtained from yeast cultures undergoing an exponential anaerobic-aerobic phase transition, levels of various glycolytic and citric acid cycle enzyme activities have been monitored in these cells. The relation of the changes in these enzyme activities in cells grown on either glucose or galactose is discussed on light of different metabolic postures these cells demonstrate as a result of their transitions. A general discussion is presented which compares the results obtained in this series of papers from both step-down and exponential transfer experiments and relates these data to control of mitochondriogenesis in yeast.
