L-type pyruvate kinase gene regulation is an excellent model of gene control by hormones and diet. In vivo and ex vivo experiments allowed us to established that thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids act on pyruvate kinase gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In contrast, glucose and insulin together stimulate transcription of this gene while glucagon inhibits it. Insulin or glucose are individually inefficient and glucagon-dependent transcriptional inhibition seems to be dominant in insulin + glucose-dependent activation. A 14-kbp fragment encompassing the entire pyruvate kinase gene and 3.2-kbp of 5' flanking sequences is expressed in transgenic mice exactly like the endogenous gene; the 3.2-kbp upstream region is sufficient to confer this tissue-specific and hormone/diet-regulated expression to reporter genes. In vivo, DNAse I hypersensitivity analysis revealed the presence of 3 liver-specific groups of hypersensitive sites (HSS). The proximal sites, between + 1 and -183 bp with respect to the start site of transcription, were, in addition, transcription-dependent. The nature and functional role of proteins binding to this proximal upstream sequence were analyzed by in vitro binding and cell free transcription experiments. The existence of more upstream cis-acting elements was investigated by transient transfection assays using differentiated hepatoma cell lines and hepatocytes in primary culture. These experiments permitted the detection of an extinguisher active in hepatoma Hep G2 cells but not in hepatocytes, and of an activating element which could correspond to a distal HSS. Unfortunately, this investigation has not yet allowed us to determine with accuracy the DNA elements responsible for response to diet and hormones.
