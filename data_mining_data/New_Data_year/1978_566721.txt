Monolayers of liver cells cultured from postnatal rats were grown in two types of media. One set of cultures was grown in selective medium which contained ornithine but was deficient in arginine; the other set was grown in nonselective medium which contained arginine but no ornithine. The cultures that were grown in the nonselective medium contained primarily a mixture of two cell types found in the liver: parenchymal hepatocytes and fibroblast-like cells. The fibroblast cells tended to overgrow the hepatocytes after several days in culture. In contrast, fibroblast overgrowth was inhibited in cultures grown in the selective, arginine-deficient medium, thereby resulting in relatively pure cultures of functional parenchymal hepatocytes. Comparative studies of sulfobromophthalein (BSP) uptake showed that the cultures grown in selective medium continued to be active much longer than the cultures grown in the nonselective medium. Pyruvate kinase assays revealed that the cultures grown in selective medium contained primarily the L-isoenzyme type which is characteristic of parenchymal hepatocytes. Cultures grown in nonselective medium contained a mixture of L- and M-isoenzymes which is indicative of nonparenchymal liver cells. The reported results indicate that selective, arginine-deficient medium permits primarily the growth of parenchymal hepatocytes found in neonatal rat liver.
