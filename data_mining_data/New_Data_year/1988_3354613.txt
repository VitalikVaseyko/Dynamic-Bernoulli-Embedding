We have evaluated the relation between height and rate of clinical progression in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In all, 111 DMD patients with age ranging from 2 to 23 years (mean 8.2 +/- 3.4 years) were assessed; of these patients, 92 had their height measured. Clinical course was determined through Vignos scale of functional disability, motor ability, and timed functional tests. All patients had grossly elevated serum creatine-kinase (CK) and pyruvate-kinase (PK) levels. When height was adjusted for patients' age, a statistically significant correlation was found between height and clinical course (positive with Vignos scale and negative with motor ability), suggesting that smaller boys have a better clinical course than taller patients of comparable age. These results support our previous hypothesis and suggest that growth inhibition seems to be effective in diminishing the progression of DMD.
