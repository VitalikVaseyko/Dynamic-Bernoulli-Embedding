Male ninespine sticklebacks, Pungitius pungitius, acclimated to 3 degrees C have higher activities of mitochondrial enzymes in their axial muscles than males acclimated to 20 degrees C. Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities tended to be higher in cold than warm acclimated males. For females, warm acclimation tended to decrease only mitochondrial enzyme activities. As thermal acclimation did not change the physical condition and most anatomic parameters of the sticklebacks, the enzymatic changes do not seem due to mobilization of somatic reserves. Field acclimatization to warm temperatures led to a marked decrease in physical condition in both males and females. This decrease in physical condition could largely be attributed to atrophy of the carcass mass. Spring males had higher activities of phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase in the axial muscle than summer males. Again, females showed a less marked response. These data suggest that environmental temperature is a major determinant of muscle aerobic capacity, at least for male ninespine sticklebacks. Thus, these northern temperate zone fish retain the capacity for thermal compensation, much like their temperate zone counterparts.
