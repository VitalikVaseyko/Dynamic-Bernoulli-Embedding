Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK), pyrimidine 5'nucleotidase (P5N) and reduced glutathione content (GSH) were studied in 126 untreated patients with acute leukaemia (AL, 80 cases), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL, 38 cases) and B-cell lymphoma with leukaemic expression (LSCL, eight cases). Acute leukaemias were classified into lymphoblastic (ALL) and non-lymphoblastic (ANLL), the latter have been further sub-divided into four different variants according to FAB morphological criteria (1976). A significant decrease of PK activity was observed only in the ANLL group, leading to a clear-cut difference with the ALL group where a normal value was obtained. The decrease of P5N activity was similar in all the morphological variants of ANLL and no abnormalities in the low PEP assay system or after fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru 1,6-P2) activation were observed. P5N activity was found to be significantly decreased in all groups of patients except in B-CLL, where it was normal. In regards to the different morphological groups of ANLL, a striking decrease of P5N activity was observed in the M3 variant. Although red cell GSH content was significantly increased in all groups of patients, no correlation was demonstrated between the raised GSH levels and the decreased P5N activities.
