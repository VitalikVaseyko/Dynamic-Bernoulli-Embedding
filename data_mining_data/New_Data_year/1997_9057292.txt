A Rhodococcus sp. 094 bacterium was tested for its ability to oxidize alkanes in crude oil emulsified by nonionic chemical and biological surfactants. Oxidation rates were measured in a 3-h period by Warburg respirometry. 14CO2 recovery was measured from the [1-14C]hexadecane spiked crude oil. Response to emulsified oil depended on the physiological state of the bacteria (i.e., cells harvested in the exponential and stationary growth phases) were tested. Oxidation rates by cells in the exponential growth phase were negatively affected by surfactant amendment. Oxidation rates by cells in the stationary growth phase were in some cases stimulated by surfactants. The stimulatory effect depended on both the chemical structure and the physicochemical properties (i.e., hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)) of the surfactants. Surfactants with intermediate HLB values (8-12) gave the best results. Neither the biosurfactants nor the commercial oil-spill dispersants tested had any significant stimulatory effect.
