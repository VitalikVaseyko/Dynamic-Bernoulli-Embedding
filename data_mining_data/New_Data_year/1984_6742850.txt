The ability for various ligands to modulate the binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) with purified rat liver pyruvate kinase was examined. Binding of Fru-1,6-P2 with pyruvate kinase exhibits positive cooperativity, with maximum binding of 4 mol Fru-1,6-P2 per enzyme tetramer. The Hill coefficient (nH), and the concentration of Fru-1,6-P2 giving half-maximal binding [FBP]1/2, are influenced by several factors. In 150 mM Tris-HCl, 70 mM KCl, 11 mM MgSO4 at pH 7.4, [FBP]1/2 is 2.6 microM and nH is 2.7. Phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate enhance the binding of Fru-1,6-P2 by decreasing [FBP]1/2. ADP and ATP alone had little influence on Fru-1,6-P2 binding. However, the nucleotides antagonize the response elicited by pyruvate or phosphoenolpyruvate, suggesting that the competent enzyme substrate complex does not favor Fru-1,6-P2 binding. Phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase or the inclusion of alanine in the medium, two actions which inhibit the enzyme activity, result in diminished binding of low concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 with the enzyme. These effectors do not alter the maximum binding capacity of the enzyme but rather they raise the concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 needed for maximum binding. Phosphorylation also decreased the nH for Fru-1,6-P2 binding from 2.7 to 1.7. Pyruvate kinase activity is dependent on a divalent metal ion. Substituting Mn2+ for Mg2+ results in a 60% decrease in the maximum catalytic activity for the enzyme and decreases the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate needed for half-maximal activity from 1 to 0.1 mM. As a consequence, Mn2+ stimulates activity at subsaturating concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, but inhibits at saturating concentrations of the substrate or in the presence of Fru-1,6-P2. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ diminish binding of low concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2; however, the concentrations of the metal ions needed to influence Fru-1,6-P2 binding exceed those needed to support catalytic activity.
