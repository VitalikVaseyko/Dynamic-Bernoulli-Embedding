Shear stress is a potential cause of erythrocyte fragmentation and hemolysis in flowing blood. In this study, the response of abnormal human erythrocytes to shear stress in virto was evaluated using a concentric cylinder viscometer. Compared to normal red cells, deoxygenated erythrocytes from persons with sicle cell anemia were particularly susceptible to fragmentation and hemolysis by shear stress. Oxygenation of sicke cell blood improved the resistance of those red cells to shear stress; they remain, however, more susceptible to shear stress than normal erythrocytes. Erythrocytes from patients with iron deficiency, thalassemia minor, and erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency showed fragmentation and hemolysis at threshold shear stresses intermediate between those ovserved for blood from patients with sickle cell anemia and normal persons. Blood samples from patients with hereditary spherocytosis were more resistant to shear stress than normal blood. These results indicate that there are important differences in the response of various red cells to shear stress.
