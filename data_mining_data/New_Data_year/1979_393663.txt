A method for the localization of pyruvate kinase isoenzymes type L, M2 and M1 in tissue sections is described. Mono-specific antibodies directed against isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase from chicken and the peroxidase antiperoxidase method were used. The following preferential localizations of the isoenzymes in chicken tissues were observed: Pyruvate kinase M1 was found in skeletal muscle. The white muscle fibers were more intensely stained than the red. Some dark muscles (e.g., anterior latissimus dorsi) and the heart muscle showed no reaction with antiserum against pyruvate kinase M1. Pyruvate kinase type L was found in the hepatocytes and in kidney cortex. Pyruvate kinase type M2 was seen in the distal tubules of kidney, in hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells in liver, in lung, adipose tissue, and in the spleen mainly in the bursa dependent areas. Pyruvate kinase type M2 was detected in high concentrations in the granulation tissue of regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy. Liver sections of a hen bearing a pancreatic tumor showed an unusually high content of pyruvate kinase type M2 in some hepatocytes, which were each clustered to spots in the liver parenchyma. Thus, contrary to previous reports, the tissue distribution of isoenzymes in chicken is similar to that of other vertebrates.
