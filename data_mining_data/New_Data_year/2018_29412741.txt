The Warburg effect is a metabolic phenomenon characterized by increased glycolytic activity, decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and the production of lactate. This metabolic phenotype is characterized in rapidly proliferative cell types such as cancerous cells and embryonic stem cells. We hypothesized that a Warburg-like metabolism could be achieved in other cell types by treatment with pharmacological agents, which might, in turn, facilitate nuclear reprogramming. The aim of this study was to treat fibroblasts with CPI-613 and PS48 to induce a Warburg-like metabolic state. We demonstrate that treatment with both drugs altered the expression of 69 genes and changed the level of 21 metabolites in conditioned culture media, but did not induce higher proliferation compared to the control treatment. These results support a role for the reverse Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblast cells in the surrounding stroma to exhibit the metabolically characterized Warburg effect. Cancer-associated fibroblasts then produce and secrete metabolites such as pyruvate to supply the cancerous cells, thereby supporting tumor growth and metastasis. While anticipating an increase in the production of lactate and increased cellular proliferation, both hallmarks of the Warburg effect, we instead observed increased secretion of pyruvate without changes in proliferation.
