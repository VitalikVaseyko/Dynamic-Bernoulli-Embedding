The understanding of control of metabolic processes requires quantitative studies of the importance of the different enzymatic steps for the magnitude of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations. An important element in such studies is the modulation of enzyme activities in small steps above and below the wild-type level. We review a genetic approach that is well suited for both Metabolic Optimization and Metabolic Control Analysis and studies on the importance of a number of glycolytic enzymes for metabolic fluxes in Lactococcus lactis. The glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PEK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PYK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are shown to have no significant control on the glycolytic flux in exponentially growing cells of L. lactis MG1363. Introduction of an uncoupled ATPase activity results in uncoupling of glycolysis from biomass production. With MG1363 growing in defined medium supplemented with glucose, the ATP demanding processes do not have a significant control on the glycolytic flux; it appears that glycolysis is running at maximal rate. It is likely that the flux control is distributed over many enzymes in L. lactis, but it cannot yet be excluded that one of the remaining glycolytic steps is a rate-limiting step for the glycolytic flux.
