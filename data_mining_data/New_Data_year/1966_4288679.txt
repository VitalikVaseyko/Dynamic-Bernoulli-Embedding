Increasing concentrations of sodium octanoate were progressively inhibitory to the activities of glucokinase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases were also markedly inhibited. Other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism such as lactate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase, and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase were not decreased. Among the key glycolytic enzymes, the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by the fatty acid was most marked. The biological significance of the inhibition of the key glycolytic enzymes is interpreted as a feedback inhibitory mechanism in regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis. The mechanism may function for rapid adaptation by which the organism can use the fatty acid level as a metabolic directional switch in decreasing glycolysis and turning on gluconeogenesis.
