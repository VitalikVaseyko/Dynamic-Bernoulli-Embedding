Glucagon caused a marked decrease in the total L-pyruvate kinase activity of control hepatocytes maintained in monolayer culture (t1/2 = 54 h), while the addition of insulin to hepatocytes isolated from a fasted rat caused a four- to fivefold increase in the total enzyme activity. Maintenance of L-pyruvate kinase in control cultures of hepatocytes was shown to require insulin. However, when 1 microM glucagon was present in the medium, the total L-pyruvate kinase activity was not maintained even in the presence of 1 microM insulin, but rather the total L-pyruvate kinase activity of the cells steadily declined from 12.1 to 5.7 units/mg DNA by the 6th day in culture. The increase in the total L-pyruvate kinase activity of fasted hepatocytes cultured in the presence of insulin was shown to result from an increase in protein synthesis, since actinomycin D and cycloheximide blocked the insulin-induced increase in the enzyme activity. The addition of 1 microM glucagon to cultures of fasted hepatocytes also blocked the insulin-induced increase in total L-pyruvate kinase activity. Since glucagon decreased the total L-pyruvate kinase activity in control hepatocytes and blocked the increase in L-pyruvate kinase activity in fasted hepatocytes, it is suggested that, in addition to the phosphorylation of L-pyruvate kinase by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, glucagon also acts to decrease the synthesis of L-pyruvate kinase in vitro.
