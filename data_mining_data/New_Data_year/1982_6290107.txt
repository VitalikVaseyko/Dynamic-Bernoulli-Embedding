Erythrocyte glycolysis has been studied in the anaemia associated with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in Kivu. Several results were compatible with a lowering of the mean age of the erythrocyte population, notably raised levels of glucose-6-phosphate, hexokinase, Na+-K+- adenosinetriphosphatases and potassium, and low sodium concentration. Non-significant differences were observed for glucose utilization, lactate formation, and for concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, adenosine diphosphate and pyruvate kinase; there was no gross disturbance of cation transport. The level of adenosine triphosphate was slightly decreased and that of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate was not elevated, in spite of anaemia. The latter could not be explained by an instability of this metabolite. It is concluded that slight erythrocyte glycolytic abnormalities may occur in the anaemia of Kivu PEM, but that they are not the main cause of the haemolysis observed in this syndrome.
