Differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemia is discussed, with regard to the classification into corpuscular and extracorpuscular types of hemolysis. Presence of antibodies in a patient's serum, indicate extracorpuscular-acquired hemolytic anemia. Coombs test may be positive or negative according to the antibody present. A primary disease has to be excluded in each case. Abnormal hemoglobin, defect of the corpuscular-hereditary type. Direct laboratory enzyme estimation indicate enzyme deficiency (Glucose-6-P-dehydrogenase, Pyruvate-kinase, Glutathione-reductase). Hemoglobinelectrophoresis and special tests for unstable hemoglobins indicate this type of disturbance. For defect of the membrane measuring of osmotic fragility might be helpful. Activity of membrane enzymes and introduction of 32P in the fractionated membrane lipids, point out special types of a deficient membrane. 6 of our own cases are discussed.
