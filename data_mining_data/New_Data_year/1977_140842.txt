The influence of clofibrate on the glycolytic pathway in liver was studied. The changes in the activity of glucokinase and hexokinase were not significant. A reduction of phosphofructokinase (p less than 0.05) and pyruvate kinase activity was found (p less than 0.0005) during clofibrate feeding. An in vitro inhibition of these enzymes could not be demonstrated by clofibrate up to a concentration of 2.5 mM. Crossover plots of glycolytic intermediates indicate that the reduced pyruvate kinase activity may influence the glycolytic pathway in vivo. Clofibrate feeding induces a lower ATP:ADP ratio, a lower adenylate energy charge and elevates AMP levels in rat liver. This may possibly stimulate the hepatic glycogenolysis and the glucose utilisation by this organ.
