Our group has developed more than 600 DNA markers to build a map of the canine genome. Of these markers, 125 correspond to genes (anchor loci). Here we report the first six autosomal genes assigned to canine chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using cosmid DNA: adenine phosphoribosyl transferase on Chromosome (Chr) 3; creatine kinase muscle type on Chr 4; pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell type on Chr 2; and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, glucose transporter protein-2, and tumor protein p53 on Chr 5. These assignments are based on the karyotype proposed by Stone and associates (Genome 34, 407, 1991) using high-resolution techniques. In addition, we have assigned the Menkes gene to the X Chr of the dog.
