L-alanine as well as AIB have been shown to stimulate gluconeogenesis in isolated kidney cortex tubules in a catalytic way. The data reported are consistent with the view, that the stimulation of renal gluconeogenesis by L-alanine and AIB is due to an inhibition of glycolysis at the level of the pyruvate kinase reaction. In the light of results of Carminatti et al. [8], showing that in kidney cortex 70-80% of total pyruvate kinase activity is represented by a type which is insensitive to inhibition by ATP but sensitive to inhibition by alanine, it appears conceivable also from our results, that alanine counteracted by FDP might contribute to the regulation of pyruvate kinase acti-ity and consequently thereby gluconeogenesis in kidney cortex.
