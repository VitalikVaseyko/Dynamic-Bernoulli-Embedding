The influence of pH upon the O(2) inhibition of (14)CO(2) photoassimilation (Warburg effect) was examined in intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts. With conditions which favored the Warburg effect, i.e. rate-limiting CO(2) and 100% O(2), O(2) inhibition was greater at pH 8.4 to 8.5 than at pH 7.5 to 7.8. At pH 8.5, as compared with 7.8, there was an enhanced (14)C-labeling of glycolate, and a decrease of isotope in some phosphorylated Calvin cycle intermediates, particularly triose-phosphate. The (14)C-labeling of starch was also more inhibited by O(2) at higher pH. The enhanced synthesis of glycolate during (14)CO(2) assimilation at higher pH resulted in a diminution in the level of phosphorylated intermediates of the Calvin cycle, and this was apparently a causal factor of the increased severity of the Warburg effect.The (14)C-labeling profiles have been interpreted in terms of a "CO(2)"-sensitive as well as a "CO(2)"-insensitive mechanism for glycolate synthesis. Both mechanisms functioned optimally at the higher pH and both responded to O(2).
