Cancer cells have distinctive energy metabolism pathways that support their rapid cell division. The preference for anaerobic glycolysis under the normal oxygen condition is known as the Warburg effect and has been observed in head and neck cancers. These metabolic changes are controlled by cancer-related transcription factors, such as tumor suppressor gene and hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha. In addition, various metabolic enzymes also actively regulate cancer-specific metabolism including the switch between aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. For a long time, these metabolic changes in cancer cells have been considered a consequence of transformation required to maintain the high rate of tumor cell replication. However, recent studies indicate that alteration of metabolism is sufficient to initiate tumor transformation. Indeed, oncogenic mutations in the metabolic enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase, have been increasingly found in various cancers, including head and neck cancers. In the present review, we introduce recent findings regarding the cancer metabolism, including the molecular mechanisms of how they affect cancer pathogenesis and maintenance. We also discuss the current and future perspectives on therapeutics that target metabolic pathways, with an emphasis on head and neck cancer.
