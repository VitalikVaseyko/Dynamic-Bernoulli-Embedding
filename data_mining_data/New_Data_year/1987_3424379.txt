Mechanical responses of isolated atria to (-)-isoproterenol and activities of myocardial pyruvate kinase and citrate synthase, enzymes involved in energy metabolism, were assessed in rats 7 days after 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) treatment. Basal tension development by electrically paced left atria was significantly elevated by all doses of TCDD (6.25, 25, or 100 micrograms/kg) when compared to that of vehicle-treated rats with unlimited access to feed. The basal rate of spontaneously beating right atria was significantly depressed in rats receiving 100 micrograms/kg TCDD. In left atria from rats treated with 100 micrograms/kg TCDD, maximal inotropic responses to (-)-isoproterenol and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine were enhanced to the same degree. Right and left atria from rats receiving 100 micrograms/kg TCDD had an increased sensitivity to the chronotropic and inotropic effects of (-)-isoproterenol, respectively. The augmented atrial effects caused by TCDD were not secondary to loss of body weight because pair-fed animals that lost the same amount of weight did not display the responses. The ratio of heart ventricular mass to body weight and the activities of pyruvate kinase and citrate synthase in homogenates of heart ventricular muscle were not affected by TCDD treatment. Thus, overtly toxic doses of TCDD in the rat did not depress mechanical function of the heart.
