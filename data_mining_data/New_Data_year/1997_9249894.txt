Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed on 12 healthy sedentary subjects and on 22 non-dyalized chronic renal failure patients (CRF) on a free diet and after overnight fasting. Parathormone, glucagon and insulin were determined at the same time of biopsies. CRF patients showed significantly low ATP and creatine phosphate levels. Regarding enzyme activities, a high hexokinase Vmax was found, while the pyruvate kinase activity was lower than in the control group. For the tricarboxylic acid cycle, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase activities were higher; total NADH cytochrome c reductase activity was also high, while cytochrome oxidase activity was slightly lower. Both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were considerably high in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, our study revealed a hypermetabolic TCA cycle, but impaired oxidative phosphorylation, which partly explained the reduced ATP concentration. Excessive protein intake and hormonal derangements may play a role in these metabolic changes.
