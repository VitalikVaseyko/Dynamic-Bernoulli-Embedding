Escherichia coli grown in a rich medium excreted acetate and reused the acetate. Using cloned genes and a plasmid with a temperature-sensitive replication origin, three kinds of Pta-Ack pathway deletion mutants were constructed. Acetate production and reuse by wild-type cells grown in the rich medium was confirmed to largely occur through the Pta-Ack pathway. The deletion mutants of the gene encoding phosphotransacetylase secreted pyruvate before the secretion of acetate into the medium. A deletion mutant of the gene encoding acetate kinase grew at a slow rate, but its secretion and use of acetate were rapid. These results indicated that a pathway(s), other than the Pta-Ack pathway, functions in the control of excess carbon flow in the mutants.
