F172-8, an H(+)-ATPase-defective mutant of the glutamic acid-producing bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 14067, exhibits enhanced rates of glucose consumption and respiration compared to the parental strain when cultured in a biotin-rich medium with glucose as the carbon source. We conducted a comparative proteomic analysis to clarify the mechanism by which the enhanced glucose metabolism in this mutant is established using a proteome reference map for strain ATCC 14067. A comparison of the proteomes of the two strains revealed the up-regulated expression of the several important enzymes such as pyruvate kinase (Pyk), malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo), and malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) in the mutant. Because Pyk activates glycolysis in response to cellular energy shortages in this bacterium, its increased expression may contribute to the enhanced glucose metabolism of the mutant. A unique reoxidation system has been suggested for NADH in C. glutamicum consisting of coupled reactions between Mqo and Mdh, together with the respiratory chain; therefore, the enhanced expression of both enzymes might contribute to the reoxidation of NADH during increased respiration. The proteomic analysis allowed the identification of unique physiological changes associated with the H(+)-ATPase defect in F172-8 and contributed to the understanding of the adaptations of C. glutamicum to energy deficiencies.
