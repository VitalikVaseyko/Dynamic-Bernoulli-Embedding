Thin-layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of various rat tissues revealed three major isozymes (types L, M1 and M2) and various intermediate forms of pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). In vitro dissociation and reassociation of purified enzymes showed that the three major isozymes had homotetrameric structures. L.M2 hybrids and M1.M2 hybrids closely resembled some naturally occurring intermediates; the subunit structure of intermediates isolated from the small intestine (form 3 or form 4) were estimated to be (L)2(M2)2 and (L)(M2)3, respectively. Pyruvate kinase activity after electrophoresis could be estimated quantitatively from densitometric measurements of the electrophoretic pattern. Type L activity in fetal liver was separated from type R activity derived from intrahepatic erythropoietic cells. It changes in three distinct steps during development: it increased during the late fetal period, remained steady during the neonatal period and increased again after weaning. Some of the intermediates found in extracts of early fetal iver were shown to cross-react with both anti-L and anti-M1 serum, suggesting that they might be L.M2 or R.M2 hybrids. These hybrid enzymes were shown to appear only during early fetal and neonatal periods.
