Hormone-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue was inhibited by fluoroacetate and there was a concomitant decrease in both the basal and hormone-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. Adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity in membrane preparations was inhibited by fluoroacetate. There was no influence of fluoroacetate on the low Km cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) activity. The rate of glucose conversion to fatty acids was increased when adipose tissue was incubated in the presence of fluoroacetate. The outputs of pyruvate and lactate into the incubation medium were decreased at this time, suggesting decreased tissue pyruvate levels and a site of activation of lipogenesis distal to pyruvate formation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1) activity was increased twofold in adipose tissue incubated in the presence of fluoroacetate. This was attributed to a fluoroacetate-induced inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, the enzyme responsible for inactivating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Glucose transport was increased to a small but significant degree by fluoroacetate. In addition, both the tissue content of citrate and its release into the incubation medium were increased, suggesting that fluoroacetate resulted in an inhibition of aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3). The tissue ATP content was unchanged. Because the antilipolytic and lipogenic effects of fluoroacetate parallel those of insulin, they may share a common mechanism.
