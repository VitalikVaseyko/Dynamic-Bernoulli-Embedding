Lysates of protoplasts from the endosperm of developing grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum) were fractionated on density gradients of Nycodenz to give amyloplasts. Enzyme distribution on the gradients suggested that: (i) starch synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase are confined to the amyloplasts; (ii) pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase are confined to the cytosol; (iii) a significant proportion (23-45%) of each glycolytic enzyme, from phosphoglucomutase to pyruvate kinase inclusive, is in the amyloplast. Starch synthase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and each of the glycolytic enzymes showed appreciable latency when assayed in unfractionated lysates of protoplasts. No activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was found in amyloplasts or in homogenates of endosperm. Antibody to plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase did not react positively, in an immunoblot analysis, with any protein in extracts of wheat endosperm. It is argued that wheat endosperm lacks significant plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and that carbon for starch synthesis does not enter the amyloplast as a C-3 compound but probably as hexose phosphate.
