The messages for LF-B1, which interacts with the cis-acting element of PKL-I to play an essential role in expression of L-type pyruvate kinase (PK) in the liver, and L-type PK were found to be present in RIN-m5F insulinoma cells as well as the liver, kidney and small intestine, although the levels of the two mRNAs in these tissues were not correlated. Gel retardation assay suggested that similar nuclear proteins bound to two other cis-acting elements, PKL-II and PKL-III, were expressed in both liver and insulinoma cells, and that additional PKL-III-binding proteins were present only in RIN-m5F cells. Thus, we suggest that the mechanism of L-type PK expression in pancreatic B cells is similar to that in the liver.
