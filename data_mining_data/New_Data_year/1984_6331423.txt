Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of a variant erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) was studied. This variant PK shows a faster electrophoretic mobility than the normal enzyme. The decreased enzyme activity observed in this variant is associated with a quantitative decrease of enzyme protein. Other parameters are within normal ranges. The partially purified variant PK is phosphorylated with a subsequent increase of k0.5s (phosphoenolpyruvate) similar to the normal control, suggesting that the structural abnormality of the variant enzyme has no influence on the phosphorylation-deactivation mechanism. On the other hand, the variant PK in the erythrocyte was less extensively phosphorylated than PK in normal erythrocytes. This may be the result of abnormal metabolism in the patient's red cells, including increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and decreased adenosine triphosphate levels.
