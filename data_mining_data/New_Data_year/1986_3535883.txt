The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was purified to homogeneity from bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). No pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity was detected at any stage of the purification. However, the purified pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was phosphorylated and inactivated with purified pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase from bovine kidney. The protein-bound radioactivity was localized in the pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha subunit. The phosphorylated, inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was dephosphorylated and reactivated with purified pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase from bovine heart. Tryptic digestion of the 32P-labeled complex yielded a single phosphopeptide, which was purified to homogeneity. The sequence of the phosphopeptide was established to be Tyr-Gly-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Thr-Thr-Tyr-Arg. This sequence is very similar to the sequence of a tryptic phosphotetradecapeptide derived from the alpha subunit of bovine kidney and heart pyruvate dehydrogenase: Tyr-His-Gly-His-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Asp-Pro-Gly-Val-Ser-Tyr-Arg.
