BACKGROUND: Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia is a widely used biomarker, associated with initial severity and poor outcomes. This increased circulating lactate concentration has been proposed to result in part from a mismatch between oxygen delivery and demand in organs. However, other mechanisms may participate. In particular, a metabolic reprogramming similar to the Warburg effect initially described in cancer cells could lead to increased lactate production by immune cells such as T lymphocytes after sepsis. The objective of this study was to set up a protocol for lactate measurement in T lymphocytes, and to evaluate whether lactate production by T lymphocytes was increased in septic shock patients. METHODS: We first optimized protocols for lactate and pyruvate measurements in T lymphocytes purified from healthy volunteers' blood, either stimulated with phytohaemagglutinine (PHA) or left untreated. We then conducted a pilot study to confirm the feasibility of this protocol in samples from septic shock patients. RESULTS: PHA stimulation induced aerobic glycolysis in human lymphocytes ex vivo, with increased lactate and pyruvate productions. To correctly measure this phenomenon, minimal cell number was 250,000 and optimal culture duration was 40 h. We also observed a significant correlation between lactate concentration in T lymphocytes and in their culture supernatants. We were able to measure lactate concentration in T lymphocytes from septic shock patients. Our preliminary results showed that intra-lymphocyte lactate concentration was not different between patients and healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: This protocol should now be tested in a larger cohort of patients. The association between immune cell metabolic reprogramming as measured by lactate concentration in T cells and functionality represents an exciting field for research.
