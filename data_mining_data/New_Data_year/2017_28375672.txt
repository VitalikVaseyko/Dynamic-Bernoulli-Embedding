Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) are currently considered an intracellular organelle "hot spot" for the intracellular signaling. MAMs are thought to function in cellular energy homeostasis, apoptosis, and calcium signaling. MAM ultrastructure in surgical specimens from human astrocytic neoplasms was studied. Abnormalities in respect to density, length, and width were found. Poorly differentiated glioma like-stem cells deficient in MAM and well-differentiated glioma cells abundant in MAM were observed. This finding could be the structural basis of functional role of MAM linked to some metabolic abnormalities in astrocytic tumors associated to mitochondrial dysfunction and the Warburg effect and their therapeutics implications.
