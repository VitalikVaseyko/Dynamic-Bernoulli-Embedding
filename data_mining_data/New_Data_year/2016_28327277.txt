Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, complex and multifactorial disease in which pulmonary vascular remodeling plays a major role ending in right heart failure and death. Current specific therapies of PAH that mainly target the vasoconstriction/vasodilatation imbalance are not curative. Bi-pulmonary transplantation remains the only option in patients resistant to current therapies. It is thus crucial to identify novel vascular anti-remodeling therapeutic targets. This remodeling displays several properties of cancer cells, especially overproliferation and apoptosis resistance of pulmonary vascular cells, hallmarks of cancer related to the metabolic shift known as the "Warburg effect". The latter is characterized by a shift of ATP production, from oxidative phosphorylation to low rate aerobic glycolysis. In compensation, the cancer cells exhibit exacerbated glutaminolysis thus resulting in glutamine addiction, necessary to their overproliferation. Glutamine intake results in glutamate production, a molecule at the crossroads of energy metabolism and cancer cell communication, thus contributing to cell proliferation. Accordingly, therapeutic strategies targeting glutamate production, its release into the extracellular space and its membrane receptors have been suggested to treat different types of cancers, not only in the central nervous system but also in the periphery. We propose that similar strategies targeting glutamatergic signaling may be considered in PAH, especially as they could affect not only the vascular remodeling but also the right heart hypertrophy known to involve the glutaminolysis pathway. Ongoing studies aim to characterize the involvement of the glutamate pathway and its receptors in vascular remodeling, and the therapeutic potential of specific molecules targeting this pathway.
