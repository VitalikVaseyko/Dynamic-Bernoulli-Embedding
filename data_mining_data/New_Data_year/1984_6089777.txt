Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels were assayed in freeze-clamped livers of anesthesized rats. All doses of pentobarbital that were effective in anesthesizing the rats caused a significant decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels. Injection of pentobarbital also resulted in decreased 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase activity and increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity measured in dialyzed (NH4)2SO4-treated liver extracts but with no change in pyruvate kinase activity. It was concluded that the anesthesia-induced decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels results at least in part from increased phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase.
