In myopathic disorders, abnormal serum enzyme activities are seen primarily in diseases of skeletal muscle where the condition involves the muscle fibers themselves. In denervation myopathies, serum enzyme activities are usually normal. The most dramatic increases of serum enzymes, particularly creatine kinase, are found in the dystrophic diseases, particularly Duchenne dystrophy. A review is given here of the many causes of abnormal serum enzyme activities where the source of enzymes is believed to be skeletal muscle. These include the dystrophies, various types of trauma, exercise, drug- and poison-induced causes including alcohol, malignant hyperthermia, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes. Tissue and serum activities are summarized for the commonly performed serum enzymes, i.e., CK, LD, AST, and aldolase. An extensive tabular and current description of the various types of dystrophies is given along with serum CK and pyruvate kinase activities.
