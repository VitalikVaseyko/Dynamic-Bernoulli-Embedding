The phylogeny and substitution rates of the mammalian X chromosome-located and autosomal phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase genes were investigated. Compatibility analysis was used to show reticulate evolution in these genes. Analysis of the marsupial, mouse, and human phosphoglycerate kinase genes suggests that at least two recombination events have taken place, one occurring about the time of the placental-marsupial split involving exons 1-5 and the other before the primate-rodent split involving exons 9-10. Similar analysis of the pyruvate dehydrogenase genes indicates a recombination event involving exons 2-3 at a time before the primate-rodent split and a gene conversion between exons 3-4 in the human somatic and testis-specific pyruvate dehydrogenase genes after the primate-rodent split. This demonstrates that genetic exchange can occur between paralogous genes at widely separated chromosomal locations. Estimation of nucleotide substitution rates in these genes confirmed a higher substitution rate in the pyruvate dehydrogenase genes. In the phosphoglycerate kinase genes, there is no difference between the substitution rates in mice and humans and between the X chromosome- and autosome-located genes. A greater substitution rate was noted in the mouse autosomal pyruvate dehydrogenase gene when compared with the other mouse and human genes. This may be a result of either directional natural selection or a relaxation of functional constraint at this specific gene.
