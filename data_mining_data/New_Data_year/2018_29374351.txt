PURPOSE: Increasing evidence shows that altered metabolism is a critical hallmark in colon cancer. There is a strong need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer metabolism. Whether the aberrant expression of microRNAs contributes to cancer metabolism is not fully understood. miR-328 is a putative potential target of SLC2A1, but the regulating mechanism between them remains unknown. We have examined whether miR-328 directly regulates SLC2A1/GLUT1 expression in colon cancer cells. METHODS: We performed in silico bioinformatic analyses to identify miR-328-mediated molecular pathways and targets. We also performed luciferase assays and western blot analyses in LOVO and SW480 colon cancer cell lines. In addition, we assessed miR-328 expression in 47 paired tumor and normal tissue specimens from resected colon cancer patients. RESULTS: Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-328 directly targeted SLC2A1 3'-untranslated region (UTR), with a significant decrease in luciferase activity in both LOVO and SW480 cell lines. These results were validated by western blot. miR-328 expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissue compared with paired normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that miR-328 targets SLC2A1/GLUT1. We suggest that miR-328 may be involved in the orchestration of the Warburg effect in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-328 expression is reduced in colon cancer patients and thus inversely correlates with the classically reported upregulated SLC2A1/GLUT1 expression in tumors.
