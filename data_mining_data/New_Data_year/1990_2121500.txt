To examine the possible effects of hyperoxalaemia on anaerobic metabolism and erythrocyte pyruvate kinase activity, we induced a rise in plasma oxalate in 11 dialysis patients by the oral administration of ascorbic acid, 500 mg day-1 for 3 weeks. Blood samples were taken from the same antecubital vein before and after the supplementation period, without venous stasis, after an overnight fast. This protocol allowed patients to be used as their own controls. Five healthy subjects underwent an identical protocol to exclude any effect of ascorbate per se. Mean (SEM) plasma oxalate (mumol l-1) rose from 30.3 (3.5) to 48.4 (6.1) in patients and from 1.4 (0.2) to 6.8 (0.9) in healthy subjects. Whole blood ascorbate (mg l-1) rose from 7.0 (0.7) to 26.6 (2.5) in patients and from 9.3 (1.2) to 17.8 (1.8) in healthy subjects (reference range 7.5-20.0 mg l-1). No changes were observed in either group in plasma creatinine, bicarbonate, haemoglobin, or erythrocyte 2,3,diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) after the 3 week supplementation period. Before supplementation lactate generation (area under curve, mmol min l-1) in the 5 min following a 60 s period of standardized ischaemic forearm exercise was significantly (P = 0.026) greater in patients [69.1 (4.7)] than in healthy subjects [46.9 (6.7)]; no significant change in lactate generation occurred in either group after ascorbate-induced hyperoxalaemia. We conclude that changes in plasma oxalate of the order of 20 mumol l-1 have no significant effect on lactate generation or 2,3,DPG levels in uraemic subjects.
