Modification of ethanol productivity and yield, using mineral medium supplemented with glucose or xylose as carbon sources, was studied in ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 by increasing the activity of five key carbon metabolism enzymes. KO11 efficiently converted glucose or xylose to ethanol with a yield close to 100% of the theoretical maximum when growing in rich medium. However, when KO11 ferments glucose or xylose in mineral medium, the ethanol yields decreased to only 70 and 60%, respectively. An increase in GALP(Ec) (permease of galactose-glucose-xylose) or PGK(Ec) (phosphoglycerate kinase) activities did not change xylose or glucose and ethanol flux. However, when PDC(Zm) (pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis) activity was increased 7-fold, the yields of ethanol from glucose or xylose were increased to 85 and 75%, respectively, and organic acid formation rates were reduced. Furthermore, as a response to a reduction in acetate and ATP yield, and a limited PDC(Zm) activity, an increase in PFK(Ec) (phosphofructokinase) or PYK(Bs) (pyruvate kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus) activity drastically reduced glucose or xylose consumption and ethanol formation flux. This experimental metabolic control analysis showed that ethanol flux in KO11 is negatively controlled by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, and positively influenced by the PDC(Zm) activity level.
