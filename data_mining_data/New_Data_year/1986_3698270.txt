We present evidence for the utility of an improved assay for the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) isoenzymes 1 and 2 in serum, involving inhibition of the H-subunit of LD by pyruvate at pH 7.1. Results correlate well with the LD-1/total LD ratio as evaluated by immunological assay and, as an index to infarct, the method is superior to either the change in CK-MB activity or to the LD-1 activity or to a combination of these tests, as is the percentage of LD-1 to total LD activity. Moreover, the percentage inhibition of LD activity by pyruvate may have an advantage over other methods of isoenzyme fractionation because of its smaller population CV for patients with acute myocardial infarction than is true of other methods. We also demonstrate how, using a linear discriminant analysis, we compared this method with alternative methods. We determined that evaluation of CK-MB isoenzyme contributes no information in addition to that obtained from the LD-1 isoenzyme.
