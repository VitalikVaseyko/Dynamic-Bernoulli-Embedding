Concentration of copper and zinc in isolated Suillus bovinus mycelia, used nutrient solution and 0.5 mol/L EDTA mycelia washing solution were measured to investigate the distribution of heavy metals in mycelia growth in excess copper or zinc nutrient solution. Treated with zinc, most of added zinc maintained in used solution, and 9.8%/14.6% was in/on mycelia in treatment, and in treatment 2 was 3.9%/8.0% in/on mycelia. In the copper applications, copper stimulated in more than on mycelia, i.e., 25.9%/4.5% in/on mycelia in treatment, and 7%/18.8% in/on mycelia while most of copper retained in used nutrient solution. Certain amount of copper or zinc uptake by mycelia led to pronounced influence on glycolysis and nitrogen incorporating process of Suillus bovinus, while the tested enzymes kept constant in treatment. In crude extracts of copper treatment 2 mycelia, activities of HK, PFK and GS were inhibited and decrease to 63%, 48% and 38% and GIDH increased by 68% of the control, respectively. The behaviors of these tested enzymes toward zinc corresponded in general with that towards copper. The potential protection of Suillus bovinus for its host plant under excess copper or zinc threaten was discussed.
