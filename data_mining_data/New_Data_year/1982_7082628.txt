1. The physiological response of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) reared on different levels of available carbohydrate in practical trout diets having the same levels of energy and nitrogen for 16-24 weeks was determined. 2. Weight gain was significantly reduced in trout reared on the highest level of available carbohydrate, 210 g cerelose (alpha-glucose) kg, and there was a significant linear regression (R2 0.88 of dietary carbohydrate on weight gain. 3. Liver: body-weight values and liver glycogen levels increased in relation to increased dietary carbohydrate. 4. Liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) activity increased and liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) activity decreased per kg body-weight of fish with increasing dietary carbohydrate. However, no significant effect was noted on the activity of these liver enzymes above a dietary cerelose level of 140 g/kg. 5. Liver fructose diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) activity increased with increasing dietary carbohydrate has been interpreted as meaning a recycling of triosephosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. 6. Dietary carbohydrate level had no significant effect on the liver pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity, the rate of glucose utilization or the percentage conversion of [14C]alanine to glucose in the plasma of trout. 7. The results indicate that rainbow trout have a limited ability to adapt to increased dietary carbohydrate and a level in excess of 140 g/kg of the diet is not efficiently utilized.
