The distribution of the phenotypes of the red cell enzymes adenosine deaminase, adenylate kinase, glutamate pyruvate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucomutase was studied in blood samples of 794 West Hungarian subjects and 955 subjects from Franconia in Bavaria. All enzymes were separated on cellulose acetate foil, SEP in starch gel. The method of separation has been described elsewhere. The phenotypes of all enzymes were found to be distributed according to the Hardy-Weinberg law. The calculated gene frequencies were in good agreement with data from the literature, according to the results of other investigations carried out in Germany and the central European region. No significant difference was found between the gene frequencies of these enzyme phenotypes in West Hungary and Franconia, although the PGM2 frequency level was higher in West Hungary than in Franconia.
