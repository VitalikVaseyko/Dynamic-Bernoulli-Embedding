In this report the authors present the results about biochemical analyses in human ejaculate. The following parameters were determined ATP, ADP, pyruvate, lactate, alpha-ketoglutarate, fructose, myokinase, phosphoglucoseisomerase, phosphoglycerate-kinase, ATPase, acid phosphatase. It was found a relationship between age and fructose content, this was equally for pyruvate, whilst the converse was observed for lactate. No age dependend relationship was observed for the other substrates. For ATP and ADP distinctly higher values can be demonstrated in normozoospermia. A special study of the extent to which the encyme activities in sperm plasma are associated with the respective pH values measured shows that pH values above 7.2 correlate with distinctly lower activities for acid phosphatase, PGI and MK.
