This review reports recent observations concerning specificities of the cellular energy metabolism in cerebral tissues that highlight on characteristics of that of glial tumours, such as the association of metabolic alterations aggressiveness of these tumours. Compared to normal cerebral tissue, glial tissue exhibits both a relative independence towards oxygen and substrate furnitures and thus vascularization, as well as the metabolic co-operation of neurons and glial cells within the tumour. Occurrence of a Warburg effect could explain such metabolic autonomy that might be associated to genetic changes observed in gliomas. Characteristics of the glycolytic metabolism within glioma tissue therefore may be novel land therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these tumours.
