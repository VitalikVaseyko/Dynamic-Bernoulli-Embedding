The discovery of the Warburg effect in the early twentieth century followed by the development of the fluorinated glucose analogue (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) and the invention of positron emission tomographs laid the foundation of clinical PET/CT. This review discusses the challenges and obstacles in clinical adoption of this technique. We then discuss advances in instrumentation, including the critically important introduction of PET/CT and current PET/CT protocols. Moreover, we provide evidence for the clinical utility of PET/CT for patient management and its potential impact on patient outcome, and address its cost and cost-effectiveness. Although this review largely focuses on (18)F-FDG imaging, we also discuss a variety of additional molecular imaging approaches that can be used for cancer phenotyping with PET. Throughout this review we emphasize the critical contributions of CT to the strength of PET/CT.
