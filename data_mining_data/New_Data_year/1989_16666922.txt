When Brassica nigra leaf petiole suspension cells were subjected to 7 days of inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation the extractable activity of: (a) pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, nonphosphorylating NADP-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase increased at least fivefold, (b) phosphorylating NAD-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased about sixfold, and (c) ATP:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, or NAD malic enzyme was not altered. Pi deprivation also resulted in significant reductions in extractable levels of Pi, ATP, ADP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and soluble protein, but caused a sixfold elevation in free amino acid concentrations. No change in inorganic pyrophosphate concentration was observed following Pi starvation. It is hypothesized that pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, nonphosphorylating NADP-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase bypass nucleotide phosphate or Pi-dependent glycolytic reactions during sustained periods of Pi depletion.
