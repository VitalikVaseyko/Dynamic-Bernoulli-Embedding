Two basic types of cancers were identified &#x2013; those with the mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells (the Warburg effect) or in fibroblasts supplying energy rich metabolites to a cancer cell with functional mitochondria (the reverse Warburg effect). Inner membrane potential of the functional and dysfunctional mitochondria measured by fluorescent dyes (e.g. by Rhodamine 123) displays low and high values (apparent potential), respectively, which is in contrast to the level of oxidative metabolism. Mitochondrial dysfunction (full function) results in reduced (high) oxidative metabolism, low (high) real membrane potential, a simple layer (two layers) of transported protons around mitochondria, and high (low) damping of microtubule electric polar vibrations. Crucial modifications are caused by ordered water layer (exclusion zone). For the high oxidative metabolism one proton layer is at the mitochondrial membrane and the other at the outer rim of the ordered water layer. High and low damping of electric polar vibrations results in decreased and increased electromagnetic activity in cancer cells with the normal and the reverse Warburg effect, respectively. Due to nonlinear properties the electromagnetic frequency spectra of cancer cells and transformed fibroblasts are shifted in directions corresponding to their power deviations resulting in disturbances of interactions and escape from tissue control. The cancer cells and fibroblasts of the reverse Warburg effect tumors display frequency shifts in mutually opposite directions resulting in early generalization. High oxidative metabolism conditions high aggressiveness. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a gate to malignancy along the cancer transformation pathway, forms a narrow neck which could be convenient for cancer treatment.
