Muscle biopsies were taken from the m. quadriceps femoris of man immediately after termination of dynamic and isometric exercise. These were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5'-phosphate (AMP), phosphorylcreatine (PC), creatine, pyruvate and lactate. Regardless of type, intensity, and duration of the preceding exercise, a general pattern of the relation between high-energy phosphates and lactate content could be observed. PG showed a nonlinear relationship to the muscle lactate content. The ratio of ATP to ADP appeared to decrease linearly when lactate content increased. The relationships are believed to be the consequence of a steady-state condition where muscle pH is one of the major determining factors.
