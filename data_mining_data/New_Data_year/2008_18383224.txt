Nutrient enrichment with a nitrogen (as nitrate) or carbon (as fructose) source to unaerated diazo and photoautorophic cultures of the cyanobacterium Anabaena torulosa induced early development of akinetes with high frequency. When cultures under any mode of nutrition were aerated, akinetes were not differentiated. Unaerated cultures with nitrate nitrogen or fructose exhibited higher respiratory rates and nitrogen assimilation compared to aerated cultures. This was evidenced by increased respiratory O2 uptake and high activities of pyruvate kinase, malate dehydrogenase (NAD+), nitrogenase and nitrate reductase signifying that akinete forming unaerated cultures exhibited high carbon dissimilation and nitrogen assimilation resulting in high nitrogenous build up in the cells. Aerated, non-akinete cultures, on the other hand, were associated with low respiratory O2 uptake, low pyruvate kinase and malate dehydrogenase (NAD+) activities, suggesting that carbon dissimilation was not favoured either in presence of nitrate or fructose. Moreover, higher activity of NADP+ linked malate dehydrogenase and lower nitrate reductase activity in aerated cultures led to a high carbon and low nitrogen content of the cells resulting in high cellular C:N ratio. The results suggest that interaction between carbon and nitrogen metabolism regulates akinete development in A. torulosa.
