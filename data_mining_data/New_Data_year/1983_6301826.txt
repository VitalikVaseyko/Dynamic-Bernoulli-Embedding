The nature of the protein phosphatases involved in the regulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis in rat liver has been investigated using L-pyruvate kinase, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase as substrates. The results show that protein phosphatases-1, 2A and 2C are the only significant protein phosphatases in rat liver acting on these four substrates. The relationship of these three enzymes to other protein phosphatases described in the literature is discussed.
