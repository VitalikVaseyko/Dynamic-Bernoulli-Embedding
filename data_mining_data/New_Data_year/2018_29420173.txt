Unequal transmission of nutritive signaling during cell division establishes fate disparity between sibling lymphocytes, but how asymmetric signaling becomes organized is not understood. We show that receptor-associated class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activity, indexed by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) staining, is spatially restricted to the microtubule-organizing center and subsequently to one pole of the mitotic spindle in activated T and B lymphocytes. Asymmetric PI3K activity co-localizes with polarization of antigen receptor components implicated in class I PI3K signaling and with facultative glucose transporters whose trafficking is PI3K dependent and whose abundance marks cells destined for differentiation. Perturbation of class I PI3K activity disrupts asymmetry of upstream antigen receptors and downstream glucose transporter traffic. The roles of PI3K signaling in nutrient utilization, proliferation, and gene expression may have converged with the conserved role of PI3K signaling in cellular symmetry breaking to form a logic for regenerative lymphocyte divisions.
