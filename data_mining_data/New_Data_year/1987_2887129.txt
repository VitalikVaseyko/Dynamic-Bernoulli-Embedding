A rapid enzymatic assay method for ammonia was developed by using glutamine synthetase from glutamate-producing bacteria together with pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH. The time required for determination of 25 nmol of ammonia was 5 min with 1 unit of glutamine synthetase, as opposed to 14-30 min with 1 unit of glutamate dehydrogenases from various sources. The present method was used to determine ammonia in serum, microbiol-culture broth, and waste water. The method can be modified for spectrophotometry in the visible region by substituting pyruvate oxidase, peroxidase, and appropriate chromogens for lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. With 4-aminoantipyrine (4AA) and phenol, and with 4AA and N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl-m-toluidine as chromogens, the sensitivity of ammonia determination was 0.65 and 1.7 times that with glutamate dehydrogenase, respectively. The present method was also applicable to the continuous detection of the activity of some ammonia-forming enzymes such as guanase, adenosine deaminase, and urease and to the determination of 0.5-30 microM ATP-ADP after some modification of the mixture.
