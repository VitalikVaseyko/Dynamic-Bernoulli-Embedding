From about the 16th day of gestation three forms of pyruvate kinase are present in foetal rat liver (L, R, and M2). Hepatocytes isolated from 15-day-old foetuses do not possess the liver form of pyruvate kinase, but after three days in culture this enzyme can be detected. No effect on the appearance of the enzyme could be seen by administration of insulin and fructose. Hepatocytes isolated from 19-day-old foetuses exhibit three forms of the enzyme (L, R, and M2) on day 1 of culture but thereafter only two forms are detectable (L and M2). A decrease in activity of the L form is observed. This could be retarded by administration of insulin and fructose.
