Supply of exogenous ethylene to lactate-grown yeast initially accelerated the rate of ethanol production from glucose, but later reduced the rate, with the overall effect being to reduce the total ethanol production. The rate of ethanol production by ethylene-treated yeast was not changed by removal of metabolic carbon dioxide. However, if CO2 was allowed to build up in the absence of applied ethylene, the ethanol production decreased. Ethylene increased the activities of a number of pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathway enzymes. The largest increase in activity was observed for phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), regulatory enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. After an initial stimulation, glucose (and also 3-O-methyl glucose) uptake was reduced by ethylene. Ethylene appears to inhibit non-competitively the glucose transport system.
