Tetanic stimulation of fibers in the hippocampal slice preparation produces long-term potentiation (LTP) and also decreases the in vitro incorporation of phosphate into the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (alpha PDH). This paper describes 6 experiments that were undertaken to replicate this observation. Hippocampal slices were incubated in a specially designed chamber and stimulated with a tungsten wire electrode in the stratum radiatum for 1 s at 100 Hz. Two minutes after the tetanus, the stimulated slices were removed alternately with control (not tetanized) slices and each group was pooled for subcellular fractionation and labeling of the fractions with [32P]ATP. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis and relative 32P contents of 41K and 50K protein bands were studied. Tetanic stimulation of the stratum radiatum did not affect subsequent phosphorylation of a 50K Mr protein that has been reported to be altered by perforant path activation. Stimulation also had no effect on pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity or on the ratio of active (dephosphorylated) to inactive enzyme. In most cases tetanic stimulation produced no significant change in the in vitro phosphorylation of this enzyme. Only under one set of conditions, labeling with 250 microM [gamma-32P]ATP for 10 s, was a decrease in the in vitro labeling of alpha PDH shown to be statistically significant. These findings suggest that LTP is not necessarily accompanied by an initial change in PDH phosphorylation level or activity but may be associated with a decrease in the kinase activity directed toward this protein.
