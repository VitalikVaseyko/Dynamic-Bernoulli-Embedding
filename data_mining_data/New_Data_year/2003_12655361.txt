The nonallosteric regulation mechanism of enzyme reaction velocity assumes that the substrate and enzyme interact via a metal cation and form simple and mixed, mono- and multi-nuclear complexes. A solution of equations for individual cases gives a function of initial reaction velocity at any given substrate or modifier concentration. This function can describe kinetic effects that are considered allosteric, as well as phenomena omitted by commonly-accepted models.
