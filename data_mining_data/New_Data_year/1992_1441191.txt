A comparative biochemical study on some enzymes of glycogenolysis, glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway in various fractions (cyst wall, cyst fluid and zoites) of the sarcocysts of Sarcocystis fusiformis from the oesophageal muscles of naturally infected Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) was carried out. The pattern and the magnitude of enzymic activity differed markedly in these fractions. Phosphorylase, hexokinase, aldolase and pyruvate kinase showed their highest levels of activity in the zoites fractions, whereas lactate dehydrogenase was the highest in cyst fluid. Alcohol dehydrogenases were non-detectable. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were localized in the cyst wall only. Zoites were considered to be the most active metabolic sites for glucose breakdown.
