Fat-storing cells and other non-parenchymal cells (endothelial and Kupffer cells) were isolated from rat liver by a combined pronase-collagenase procedure and subsequent Visotrast-370 density gradient centrifugation. The lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme pattern of fat-storing cells was found different from that of other non-parenchymal liver cells. Fat-storing cells contain LDH-4 as the main isoenzyme and do not contain LDH-1, whereas the other non-parenchymal cells have all five lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes, among which LDH-5 is dominating. All non-parenchymal liver cell populations contain the M-type pyruvate kinase. The alkaline phosphatase of fat-storing cells has the same electrophoretic mobility as that of the other non-parenchymal cells.
