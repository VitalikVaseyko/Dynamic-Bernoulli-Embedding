Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) has been wildly verified to modulate glycolysis in tumor cells. However, the role of PKM2 on the glycolysis of osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes is still unclear. In present study, we investigate the function of PKM2 on OA chondrocyte glycolysis and the collagen matrix generation in vitro. Results showed that PKM2 was upregulated in OA chondrocytes compared with healthy control chondrocytes. In OA chondrocytes, ATP expression was lower compared with healthy control chondrocytes. Loss-of-function experiment showed that PKM2 knockdown mediated by lentivirus transfection could significantly suppress the glucose consumption and lactate secretion levels and decrease glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha), indicating the inhibition of PKM2 knockdown on glycolysis. Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that PKM2 knockdown inhibited OA chondrocyte proliferation and promoted the apoptosis. Western blot and immunocytochemical staining showed that PKM2 knockdown downregulated the expression levels of COL2A1 and SOX-9. In summary, our results conclude that PKM2 modulates the glycolysis and extracellular matrix generation, providing the vital role of PKM2 on OA pathogenesis and a novel therapeutic target for OA.
