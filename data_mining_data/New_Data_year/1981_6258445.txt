The effects of diabetes on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism were investigated in spontaneously diabetic Bio-Breeding Worcester (BB/W) rats. The juvenile-onset-type syndrome displayed by these animals is characterized by beta-cell destruction with subsequent ketosis-prone insulinopenia. Livers from diabetic animals demonstrated increased adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels but subnormal total protein and glycogen content. Isolated perfused livers of diabetic BB/W rats demonstrated an increased rate of glucose production from [14C]lactate and an impaired rate of glycogen synthesis. These data were consonant with hepatic enzyme studies demonstrating markedly increased activities of component gluconeogenic (glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and glycogenolytic (glycogen phosphorylase) enzymes with decreased activities of glycolytic (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) and glycogenic (glycogen synthase) enzymes. These findings agree with previous studies using alloxan- and streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals and suggest that accelerated hepatic gluconeogenesis and impaired glucose utilization are pathognomonic of all insulin-deficient diabetic syndromes.
