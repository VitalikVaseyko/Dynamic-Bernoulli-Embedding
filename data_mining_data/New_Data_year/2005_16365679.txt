Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Bugang) plants exhibit a hypersensitive response (HR) upon infection by Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) pathotype P(0). Previously, to elucidate molecular mechanism that underlies this resistance, hot pepper cv. Bugang leaves were inoculated with TMV-P(0) and genes specifically up-regulated during the HR were isolated by microarray analysis. One of the clones, Capsicum annuum cytosolic pyruvate kinase 1 (CaPK(c)1) gene was increased specifically in the incompatible interaction with TMV-P(0). The expression of CaPK(c)1 gene was also triggered not only by various hormones such as salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but also NaCl and wounding. These results suggest that CaPK(c)1 responds to several defense-related abiotic stresses in addition to TMV infection.
