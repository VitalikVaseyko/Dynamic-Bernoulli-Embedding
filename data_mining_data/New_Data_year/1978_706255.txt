Metabolic activity of rat lungs were studied in normal state and in acute hypoxia, caused by an effect of rarefied atmosphere (3 hrs, "height" 10,000 m). Glycolytic splitting of carbohydrates and catabolism of proteins were increased in lungs under hypoxic stress. In hypoxia activities of adlobase, pyruvate kinase, succinate dehydrogenase, 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase were increased, but hexokinase activity was decreased. Activities of lipase, lactate dehydrogenase and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase were not altered, whereas the ratio in specific activity of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase was decreased.
