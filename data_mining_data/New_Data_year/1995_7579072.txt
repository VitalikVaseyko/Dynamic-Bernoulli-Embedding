In order to improve knowledge about the mechanisms underlying the alterations of energy metabolism recently observed in the skeletal muscle of patients suffering from chronic renal failure, this study was designed to test (1) whether changes in the activity of key enzymes of energy metabolism occur in the muscle of these patients, and if so (2) whether the different muscle fiber types are equally altered in their metabolic machinery. For this, the maximum activities of 14 enzymes were measured in individual muscle fibers microdissected from biopsies of rectus abdominis muscle obtained from seven normal subjects and seven patients with end-stage renal failure before renal replacement therapy. A large decrease in the activities of beta-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the beta-oxidation pathway, of citrate synthase, which initiates the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which contributes to the synthesis of glycogen from lactate, was observed in the three fiber types (slow-twitch oxidative, fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic, and fast-twitch glycolytic). A smaller reduction of the activities of phosphofructokinase and/or pyruvate kinase, two key enzymes of glycolysis, was also observed in slow-twitch oxidative and/or fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers. These results demonstrate that the abnormalities of muscle energy metabolism observed in patients with chronic renal failure are due, at least in part, to intrinsic changes in the key enzymes of major energy-providing pathways; they also offer a satisfactory explanation for the defect of oxidative metabolism recently demonstrated in the muscle of these patients.
