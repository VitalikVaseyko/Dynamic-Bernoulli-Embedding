Asymmetry in the cow affects ovarian function and pregnancy. In this work we studied ovarian and uterine asymmetry. Synchronised animals, in which in vitro-produced embryos (n=30-60) had been transferred on Day 5 to the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL), were flushed on Day 8. Ovulatory follicle diameter, oestrus response and total protein flushed did not differ between sides. However, a corpus luteum in the right ovary led to plasma progesterone concentrations that were higher than when it was present in the left ovary. Fewer embryos were recovered from the left than the right horn. Among 60 uterine proteins identified by difference gel electrophoresis, relative abundance of nine (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long chain; twinfilin, actin-binding protein, homologue 1; enolase 1; pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (rabbit); complement factor B Bb fragment ; albumin; fibrinogen gamma-B chain; and ezrin differed (P<0.05) between horns. Glucose concentration was higher, and fructose concentration lower, in the left horn. In a subsequent field trial, pregnancy rates after embryo transfer did not differ between horns (51.0+/-3.6, right vs 53.2+/-4.7, left). However, Day 7 blood progesterone concentrations differed (P=0.018) between pregnant and open animals in the left (15.9+/-1.7 vs 8.3+/-1.2) but not in the right horn (12.4+/-1.3 vs 12.4+/-1.2). Progesterone effects were independent of CL quality (P=0.55). Bilateral genital tract asymmetry in the cow affects progesterone, proteins and hexoses without altering pregnancy rates.
