Quinolinic acid (QA) has been shown to evoke neurotoxic events via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) overactivation and oxidative stress. NMDARs are particularly vulnerable to free radicals, which can modulate protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities. The src family of tyrosine kinases are associated with the NMDAR complex and regulate NMDA channel function. Because QA is an NMDAR agonist as well as a pro-oxidant agent, we investigated whether it may affect the activity of PTKs and PTPs in vivo and in vitro. In synaptosomes prepared from striata dissected 15 min, 30 min or 15 days after bilateral injection of QA we observed modulation of the phosphotyrosine pattern; a significant decrease in PTP activity; and a sustained increase in c-src and lyn activity at 15 and 30 min after treatment with QA, followed by a decrease 2 weeks later. Striatal synaptosomes treated in vitro with QA showed time- and dose-dependent modulation of c-src and lyn kinase activities. Moreover, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester, the NMDAR antagonist d-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and pyruvate suppressed the QA-induced modulation of c-src activity. These findings suggest a novel feature of QA in regulating src kinase activity through the formation of reactive radical species and/or NMDAR overactivation.
