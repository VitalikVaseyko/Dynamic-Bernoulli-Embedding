The age dependent behaviour of 11, mainly glycolytic, red blood cell enzymes in 26 patients with various haematological disorders has been investigated after separation of red blood cells by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. The frequency of enzyme deficiencies in the old cells of these patients was significantly increased in comparison with the unseparated cells, 29 and 13 deficiencies, respectively. Particularly hexokinase activity, although normal or even increased in unseparated cells, was found deficient in old cells in seven cases. In addition, an increased number of phosphofructokinase deficiencies was observed in the patients' old cells (eight cases) as compared to the unseparated cells (three cases). However, the red blood cells of the majority of these patients were found to contain increased enzyme activities, irrespective of cell age. Enzyme activities in the youngest cell population did not correlate with the reticulocyte count. Cases of high pyruvate kinase and hexokinase activities were studied for kinetical, electrophoretical and immunological properties of the respective enzymes, but no abnormalities could be demonstrated, indicating an increased synthesis of these enzymes.
