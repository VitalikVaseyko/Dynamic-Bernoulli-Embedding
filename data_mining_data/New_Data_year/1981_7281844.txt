Porcine livers were preserved for 6 hours by simple hypothermic storage using plasma-protein-fraction, albumin, Collins C2, Ringer solution, and Ring-trickle-perfusion. Following glycolytic metabolites were examined: G6P, F6P, FDP, GAP, 2PG, PEP, pyruvate, and lactate. An alteration of glycolytic metabolite-profile by the different preservation methods was not seen. There is a limitation of glycolysis by the pyruvate-kinase-reaction. Glycolysis decreases depending from preservation time. An artificial increasing of glycogen or rate of glycolysis before hepatectomy seems to be without any effect.
