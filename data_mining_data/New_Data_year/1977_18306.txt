In several patients suffering from congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia or from malignant hemotological disorder associated with erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, a metabolic study has been carried out involving the following biochemical determinations: assay of red cell enzyme activities; estimation of glucose consumption; measurement of the rate of glycolytic intermediates; and, in some cases, enzyme purification and characterization of the PK variant. Metabolic equilibrium most probably does not depend on kinetic characteristics of PK molecules. Furthermore, the data obtained allow separation of cases with congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (hereditary defect) and acquired PK deficiencies.
