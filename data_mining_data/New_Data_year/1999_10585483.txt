In Escherichia coli, changes in redox condition of growth are sensed and signaled by the Arc two-component system. This system consists of ArcB as the membrane-associated sensor kinase and ArcA as the cytoplasmic response regulator. ArcB is a tripartite kinase, possessing a primary transmitter, a receiver, and a secondary transmitter domain that catalyzes the phosphorylation of ArcA via a His --> Asp --> His --> Asp phosphorelay, as well as the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by a reverse phosphorelay. When ArcA and ArcB were incubated with ATP, the peak levels of phosphorylated proteins increased in the presence of the fermentation metabolites D-lactate, acetate, or pyruvate. In this study, we report that these effectors accelerate the autophosphorylation activity of ArcB and enhance the transphosphorylation of ArcA, but have no effect on the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P. Moreover, the presence of the receiver domain of ArcB is essential for the effectors to influence the autophosphorylation rate of the primary transmitter domain of ArcB.
