Pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-0-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 40) from bovine adrenal cortex was purified 243 fold. The whole purification procedure included ammonium sulphate fractionation, heat treatment, Sephadex HW-55 chromatography and phosphocellulose chromatography. The specific activity of the preparation is 15.6 U/mg at 30 degrees C, the yield--36%. Pyruvate kinase showed only one protein band as judged by sodium dodecyl sulphate acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme displayed a hyperbolic saturation curve with respect to P-enolpyruvate. The apparent Km for this substrate was 0.55 X 10(-4) M, pH optimum--6.8-7.0. K+ concentrations above 0.1 M inhibit the enzyme.
