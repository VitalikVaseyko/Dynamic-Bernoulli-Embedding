The characteristics of the energy metabolism were evaluated in the gastrocnemius muscle from 3- and 24-month-old rats in normoxia or subjected to either mild or severe chronic (4 weeks) intermittent normobaric hypoxia. Furthermore, 4-week treatment with saline or the TRH-analogue posatireline was performed. The muscular concentration of the following metabolites related to the energy metabolism was evaluated: glycogen, glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate; aspartate, glutamate, alanine; ammonia; ATP, ADP, AMP, creatine phosphate; energy charge potential. Furthermore the maximum rate of the following muscular enzymes was evaluated: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; total NADH cytochrome c reductase; cytochrome oxidase. The age-related decrease in muscular glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate and alanine concentrations and increase in citrate concentration were consistent with the age-related decreased hexokinase and increased citrate synthase activities. Ageing was characterized by a decrease in muscular creatine phosphate concentration, while the energy mediators and the energy charge potential were unchanged. The chronic (4 weeks) intermittent normobaric mild and severe hypoxia-induced alterations of the components in the anaerobic glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and energy storage, that were magnified in the skeletal muscle from the oldest animals. The effect of the chronic treatment with the TRH-analogue posatireline suggests that the action of central nervous system-acting drugs could also be related to their direct influence on the muscular biochemical mechanisms related to the energy transduction.
