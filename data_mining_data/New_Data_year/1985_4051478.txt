Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase was immobilized by covalent attachment to a polyacrylamide support (Akrilex C) containing carboxylic functional groups. As a result of immobilization, the pH optimum for catalytic activity shifted into a more alkaline direction. The apparent Km value with phosphoenolpyruvate increased, and that with ADP slightly decreased. With respect to the stability against urea and thermal inactivation, the immobilized pyruvate kinase seemed to be the more stable at lower urea concentrations and between 45 and 55 degrees C. At 1.5 and 2.5M urea and at higher temperature, there were no marked differences between the soluble and the immobilized enzyme.
