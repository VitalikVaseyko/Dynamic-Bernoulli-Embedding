The potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced a rapid increase in glycolysis in rat thymocytes. The increase in the glycolytic flux was also reflected by elevated fructose 1,6-diphosphate levels. TPA treatment did not result in an increase of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase when measured in cell homogenates. It is suggested that the early increase in glycolysis in TPA treated lymphocytes may result from TPA-mediated increase in glucose transport.
