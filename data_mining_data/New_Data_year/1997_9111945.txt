The effect of cytoskeleton modulators on glycolytic enzyme binding was examined in the hepatopancreas of Otala lactea in an attempt to identify potential cellular binding sites. Binding was followed by measuring phosphofructokinase (PFK), aldolase (ALD), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) distribution between low speed pellets (12,000 xg), high speed pellets (100,000 xg) and high speed supernatants. Taxol (which stabilizes microtubules), colchicine (which destabilizes microtubules) and cytochalasin B and D (which destabilize F-actin filaments) were added to the homogenate prior to centrifugation. Addition of taxol increased the amount of PFK associated with the high speed pellet. Cytochalasin B and D reduced the binding of PFK and PK to the low speed pellet. ALD and GAPDH binding were unaffected by any treatment. Lowering the pH of the crude homogenate increased PFK binding to the low speed pellet by 33%. This effect could be reversed by addition of cytochalasin B and D suggesting that pH influences the PFK-F-actin interaction in vivo. The differential binding response of PFK, PK, ALD and GAPDH to added effectors suggests that, in the cell, PFK and PK are bound to different subcellular structural elements than are ALD and GAPDH.
