This study analyzed the differences in karyotype and genetic variation between a mutant and wild-type Siraitia grosvenorii. Genetic variation included changes in genome and gene expression by SRAP molecular markers. Results showed that wild-type S. grosvenorii was diploid, with a chromosome number of 2n = 2x = 28, whereas the mutant was tetraploid with a chromosome number of 2n = 4x = 56. 4573 DNA bands were obtained using 189 different primer combinations, 577 of which were polymorphic, averaging 3.1 bands for each primer pair, while 1998 pairs were identical. There were no apparent differences on bands amplified by most primer pairs. After comparing the diploid and tetraploid strains, the data generally indicated that the polymorphism would be quite low. 2917 cDNA bands were generated using 133 primer combinations, and stable and clearly differential fragments were sorted out, cloned and sequenced. Ninety-two differentially expressed fragments were successfully sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that most fragments had significant homologous nucleotide sequences with resistant to stress and photosynthesis genes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, peroxisomal membrane transporter, NBS-LRR type resistance protein, protein phosphatase and others. The results revealed that the tetraploid strain has more resistant and photosynthesis ability than its diploid relatives, which providing reference information and resources for molecular breeding and seedless Luohanguo.
