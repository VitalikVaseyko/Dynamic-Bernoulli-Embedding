The activities of uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48), uridine monophosphate (UMP) kinase (EC 2.7.1.3.14), and uridine diphosphate (UDP) kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) were measured in retinal high-speed supernatant fractions following unilateral optic nerve crush in the goldfish. The enzyme activities followed a similar time course, with initial increases 2-3 days following nerve crush, peak activity at 4 days, and a gradual return to basal levels by day 21. The magnitude of the stimulation on day 4 was about 35% in each case. Activities of two enzymes of intermediary metabolism, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) and lactic dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), were not altered, indicating that the coordinate increases in nucleoside and nucleotide kinase activities were specific responses to the nerve injury. The increased labeling could not be explained by altered phosphohydrolytic activities. The nature of the enhancement was further studied in UDP kinase, the most active of the kinases examined. Neither low-molecular-weight components nor substrate availability could account for the observed increase in UDP kinase in the 4 day post-crush retinas. The Km for UDP was unaltered, and a mixing experiment did not support the possibility that stimulatory or inhibitory factors played a role. The enhancement of UDP kinase activity was blocked by injection of actinomycin D following nerve crush. The results suggest that the observed increases in enzymes of uridine metabolism result from their increased formation following nerve crush.
