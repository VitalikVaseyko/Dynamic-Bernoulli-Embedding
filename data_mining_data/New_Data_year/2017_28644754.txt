Purpose/Aim: Cancer cells are addicted to glycolytic anaerobic pathways, in presence or in absence of a functional Krebs' cycle (phenomenon Warburg). This metabolic predilection relies on both extracellular (impaired vascularization and oxygenation) and intracellular (oncogenic activation of genes) causes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression and prognostic relevance of enzymes involved in the glucose absorption and metabolism, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) expression, MCT1 and MCT2, pentose pathway (Glucose-6-phospahte dehydrogenase G6PD), glycogene synthesis (glycogene synthase GYS1), glycolysis (Hexokinase HXKII, phosphofructokinase PFK1, fructose biphosphate aldolase), fate of pyruvate (pyruvate dehydrogenase PDH, phosphorylated pPDH, PDH kinase PDK1, lactate dehydrogenase LDH5 and LDH1) and key Kreb's cycle enzymes (citrate synthase CSynth and isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH). RESULTS: A strong overexpression of the above enzymes/proteins was noted in a varying percentage of cases examined. An interesting significant correlation between the enzymes involved in glycolysis and with the LDH5 was noted. Adenocarcinomas expressed higher levels of GLUT1 and MCT2 compared to other subtypes. Stage (p = 0.0001), aldolase (p = 0.004), LDH5 (p = 0.008), GLUT2 (p = 0.008), MCT2 (p = 0.009), GSYS1 (p = 0.04), and GLUT1 (p = 0.05) were significantly related with poor disease specific overall survival. In multivariate analysis stage (p = 0.001), LDH5 (p = 0.04), pPDH (p = 0.04), and aldolase (p = 0.04) were independent prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an orchestrated activation of glucose absorption and metabolism towards anaerobic pathways characterize the majority of NSCLC, and this phenotype is strongly linked with an aggressive clinical behavior. This glycolytic addiction of lung cancer cell is revealed as a key therapeutic target.
