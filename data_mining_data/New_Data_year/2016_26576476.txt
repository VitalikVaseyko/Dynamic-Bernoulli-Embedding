Hypoxia has been proved to be a typical character of solid tumors. Tumor cells prefer to use glucose through the glycolysis pathway instead of aerobic respiration. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this so-called Warburg effect remains elusive. In the current study, siRNA was synthesized and transfected into BxPC-3 cell line to silence the expression of HIF-1alpha gene. It was found that hypoxia induced hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) overexpression in BxPC-3 cells, enhanced the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A, thus facilitating glycolysis and making tumor cells more tolerant to hypoxic stress. The silencing of HIF-1alpha gene significantly attenuated glycolysis under hypoxic conditions, inhibited the growth and invasion ability of BxPC-3 cells, and enhanced hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis.
