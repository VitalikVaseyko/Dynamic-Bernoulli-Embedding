There is critical demand in contemporary medicine for gene expression markers in all areas of human disease, for early detection of disease, classification, prognosis, and response to therapy. The integrity of circadian gene expression underlies cardiovascular health and disease; however time-of-day profiling in heart disease has never been examined. We hypothesized that a time-of-day chronomic approach using samples collected across 24-h cycles and analyzed by microarrays and bioinformatics advances contemporary approaches, because it includes sleep-time and/or wake-time molecular responses. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the value of this approach in cardiovascular disease using a murine Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) model of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice. First, microarrays and a novel algorithm termed DeltaGene were used to identify time-of-day differences in gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy 8 wks post-TAC. The top 300 candidates were further analyzed using knowledge-based platforms, paring the list to 20 candidates, which were then validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Next, we tested whether the time-of-day gene expression profiles could be indicative of disease progression by comparing the 1- vs. 8-wk TAC. Lastly, since protein expression is functionally relevant, we monitored time-of-day cycling for the analogous cardiac proteins. This approach is generally applicable and can lead to new understanding of disease.
