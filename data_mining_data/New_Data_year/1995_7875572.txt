The phoD gene encoding the membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALPI) from Zymomonas mobilis CP4 was cloned and sequenced. Both the translated sequence and the properties of the recombinant enzyme were unusual. Z. mobilis ALPI was monomeric (M(r) 62,926) and hydrolysed nucleotides more effectively than sugar phosphates. The translated sequence contained a single hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus which may serve as a membrane-anchor in Z. mobilis, although the recombinant enzyme was recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction of Escherichia coli. The predicted amino acid sequence for ALPI did not align well with other ALPs or other known genes. However, some similarity to E. coli ALP was noted in the metal-binding and phosphate-binding regions. Two other regions were identified with similarity to the active sites of pyruvate kinase and mammalian 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (also membrane-bound), respectively. It is likely that Z. mobilis phoD represents a new class of alkaline phosphatase genes which has not been described previously.
