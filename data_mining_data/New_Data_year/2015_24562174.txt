Diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel diseases rely on clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic parameters. Inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated as a surrogate marker for endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory activity. Fecal inflammatory biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin are direct products of bowel inflammation and provide an accurate and noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring modality for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This report contains an overview of the currently existing literature pertaining to clinical implications of fecal biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease.
