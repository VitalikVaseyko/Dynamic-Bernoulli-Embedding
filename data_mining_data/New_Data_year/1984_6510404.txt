The red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, KM for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and thermostability properties were studied in patients with acute leukemias. The acquired PK defect was found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, while it was normal in acute non-myeloid leukemia enzyme kinetic tests. PK abnormality was expressed in 17 patients as deficient PK activity, in 15 patients as decreased enzyme thermostability, and in 11 patients as altered PK affinity for ADP.
