This study attempted to determine whether the quantity and the quality of protein intake could influence the activity of some enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, adult rats were fed for 23 days a diet containing different levels (10 to 70%) and qualities (casein, wheat gluten, and egg yolk) of protein. Variations in liver enzyme activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), malic enzyme (ME), glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were studied. Also the changes in enzyme activities were compared with changes in food intake and body weight gain. Increasing the protein level produced a progressive fall in the activities of ME and PK. The decrease in PK activity was greater when the biological value of the dietary proteins was higher (P less than 0.05). On the other hand, the activities of G6PDH and PEPCK increased as the protein level increased. The activity of G6Pase was unchanged. The relationship between the two opposing enzyme activities PK and PEPCK, in relation to protein intake, shows that for each protein studied, the equilibrium between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis was obtained at different protein intakes (1.5, 1.9, and 2.2 g of protein/day/100 g of body weight, respectively, for egg yolk, casein, and wheat gluten) regardless of daily consumption of energy as carbohydrate, which are similar (8 to 9 kcal/day/100 g of body weight). This equilibrium also corresponded to the maximum weight gain (5 g) of the experimental animals. In conclusion, the experimental method used permits a simultaneous assessment of the protein and carbohydrate requirements ensuring the best weight gain in young adult rats.
