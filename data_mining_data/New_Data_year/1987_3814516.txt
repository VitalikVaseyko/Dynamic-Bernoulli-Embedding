The activity of granulocyte pyruvate kinase in 46 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and eight patients with psoriasis arthropathica was investigated. It was found that in both groups of patients the activity of pyruvate kinase was significantly higher than in healthy individuals. This suggests that the rate of glycolysis in granulocytes of patients with psoriasis is markedly increased. The activity of granulocyte pyruvate kinase in 11 psoriatic patients with actively spreading lesions was compared with the activity of this enzyme when the patients were in remission. The activity of the enzyme was significantly increased during the active stage of the disease and returned to normal during remission.
