Skin cancers are the most common cancers worldwide. The incidence of common skin cancers, including basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and melanomas, continues to rise by 5 to 7% per year, mainly due to ultraviolet (UV) exposure and partly because of aging. This suggests an urgent necessity to improve the level of prevention and protection for skin cancers as well as developing new prognostic and diagnostic markers of skin cancers. Moreover, despite innovative therapies especially in the fields of melanoma and carcinomas, new therapeutic options are needed to bypass resistance to targeted therapies or treatment's side effects. Since reprogramming of cellular metabolism is now considered as a hallmark of cancer, some of the recent findings on the role of energy metabolism in skin cancer initiation and progression as well as its effect on the response to targeted therapies are discussed in this review.
