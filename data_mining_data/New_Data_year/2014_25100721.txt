Many factors are known to influence the oligomerization, fibrillation, and amyloid formation of the Abeta peptide that is associated with Alzheimer disease. Other proteins that are present when Abeta peptides deposit in vivo are likely to have an effect on these aggregation processes. To separate specific versus broad spectrum effects of proteins on Abeta aggregation, we tested a series of proteins not reported to have chaperone activity: catalase, pyruvate kinase, albumin, lysozyme, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin. All tested proteins suppressed the fibrillation of Alzheimer Abeta(1-40) peptide at substoichiometric ratios, albeit some more effectively than others. All proteins bound non-specifically to Abeta, stabilized its random coils, and reduced its cytotoxicity. Surprisingly, pyruvate kinase and catalase were at least as effective as known chaperones in inhibiting Abeta aggregation. We propose general mechanisms for the broad-spectrum inhibition Abeta fibrillation by proteins. The mechanisms we discuss are significant for prognostics and perhaps even for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer disease.
