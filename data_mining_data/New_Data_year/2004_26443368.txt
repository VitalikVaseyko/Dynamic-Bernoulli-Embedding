Pyruvate and acetyl-CoA form the backbone of central metabolism. The nonoxidative cleavage of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate by the glycyl radical enzyme pyruvate formate lyase is one of the signature reactions of mixed-acid fermentation in enterobacteria. Under these conditions, formic acid accounts for up to one-third of the carbon derived from glucose. The further metabolism of acetyl-CoA to acetate via acetyl-phosphate catalyzed by phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase is an exemplar of substrate-level phosphorylation. Acetyl-CoA can also be used as an acceptor of the reducing equivalents generated during glycolysis, whereby ethanol is formed by the polymeric acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE) enzyme. The metabolism of acetyl-CoA via either the acetate or the ethanol branches is governed by the cellular demand for ATP and the necessity to reoxidize NADH. Consequently, in the absence of an electron acceptor mutants lacking either branch of acetyl-CoA metabolism fail to cleave pyruvate, despite the presence of PFL, and instead reduce it to D-lactate by the D-lactate dehydrogenase. The conversion of PFL to the active, radical-bearing species is controlled by a radical-SAM enzyme, PFL-activase. All of these reactions are regulated in response to the prevalent cellular NADH:NAD+ ratio. In contrast to Escherichia coli and Salmonella species, some genera of enterobacteria, e.g., Klebsiella and Enterobacter, produce the more neutral product 2,3-butanediol and considerable amounts of CO2 as fermentation products. In these bacteria, two molecules of pyruvate are converted to alpha-acetolactate (AL) by alpha-acetolactate synthase (ALS). AL is then decarboxylated and subsequently reduced to the product 2,3-butandiol.
