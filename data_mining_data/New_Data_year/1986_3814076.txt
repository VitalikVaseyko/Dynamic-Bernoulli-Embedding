Starvation of rats for 48 h increased the activity of PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) kinase 2.2-fold in extracts of liver mitochondria, 2.9-fold in PDH complex partially purified therefrom by fractional precipitation, and 5-fold in PDH complex partially purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. A protein fraction was separated from PDH complex in extracts of rat liver mitochondria by gel filtration or fractional precipitation, which increased the activity of PDH kinase in rat liver and pig heart PDH complexes. The activity of this protein fraction was increased approx. 2.5-fold by 48 h starvation of rats. With highly purified pig heart PDH complex it was shown that the protein fraction increased the Vmax. of the PDH kinase reaction 35-fold (fraction from fed rats) or 82-fold (fraction from starved rats); starvation had no effect on the concentration of protein fraction required to give 0.5 Vmax. Evidence is given that the increase in PDH kinase activity effected in extracts of liver mitochondria by starvation is due to increased activity of kinase activator protein, which is tightly bound by rat liver PDH complex and not removed by a single gel filtration. With pig heart PDH complex, increased PDH kinase activity was retained after gel filtration of an admixture with kinase activator protein from starved rats, but was restored to the control value by a second gel filtration; the alterations in PDH kinase activity were associated with obvious changes in protein bands in SDS gels.
