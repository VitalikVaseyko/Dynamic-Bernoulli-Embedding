In a reconstituted open and homogeneous enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase sustained oscillations could experimentally be generated. The approach is based on a stirred flow-through reaction chamber. The periodic motions of the reactants are mainly caused by the antagonistic allosteric effects of the adenine nucleotides on the activities of the phosphofructokinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.
