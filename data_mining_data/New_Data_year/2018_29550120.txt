Previous studies have demonstrated that the anti-tumor alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid complex (alpha-LA-OA) may target the glycolysis of tumor cells. However, few data are available regarding the effects of alpha-LA-OA on energy metabolism. In this study, we measured glycolysis and mitochondrial functions in HeLa cells in response to alpha-LA-OA using the XF flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The gene expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transfer chain, and ATP synthesis were also evaluated. Our results show that alpha-LA-OA significantly enhanced the basal glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including the basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity and ATP production were also improved in response to alpha-LA-OA. The enhanced mitochondrial functions maybe partly due to the increased capacity of utilizing fatty acids and glutamine as the substrate. However, the gene expressions of pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 were inhibited, suggesting an insufficient ability for the glycolysis process and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The increased expression of acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2, a central enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, would enhance the unbalance due to the decreased expression of electron transfer flavoprotein beta subunit, which acts as the electron acceptor. These results indicated that alpha-LA-OA may induce oxidative stress due to conditions in which the ATP production is exceeding the energy demand. Our results may help clarify the mechanism of apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial destruction.
