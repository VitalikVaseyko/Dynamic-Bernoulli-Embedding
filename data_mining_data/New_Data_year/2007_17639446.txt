Tumorigenesis involves energy production by aerobic glycolysis ("Warburg effect") in malignant tumors. One of the key enzymes is transketolase. Transketolase, transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1), and transketolase-like-2 are known. Antibodies against TKTL1 exist for immunohistochemical investigations. This study investigated the influence of TKTL1 on survival and metastasizing in 40 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs, T2-T4, 27 metastasized). Staining was assessed by an immunoreactive score (IRS) with values from 0 to 12 in primaries and their nodal metastases. The highest IRS was 8. Normal epithelium did not show an expression. Three SCCs were negative. Advanced SCCs had a higher IRS than lower stages. An IRS>4 was associated with a shorter disease specific survival, independent on the tumor stage in the multivariate analysis. Significant differences between metastasized and non-metastasized SCCs were absent, but poorly differentiated SCCs had a higher IRS in their metastases than moderate differentiated SCCs. TKTL1 overexpression is associated with a more aggressive behavior and shorter survival of laryngeal SCCs. These observations could lead to additional therapeutic options targeting a blocking of the enzyme activity.
