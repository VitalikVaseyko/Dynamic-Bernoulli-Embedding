Serum pyruvate kinase activity was measured in several myopathic and denervating illnesses as well as in 86 potential carriers of Duchenne dystrophy. These data showed that in potential Duchenne carriers, the serum pyruvate kinase assay is more sensitive in younger patients, especially those under 20 years of age.
