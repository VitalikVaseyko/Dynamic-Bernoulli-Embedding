A short-term training program involving 2 h of daily exercise at 59% of peak O2 uptake (VO2max) repeated for 10-12 consecutive days was employed to determine the significance of adaptations in energy metabolic potential on alterations in energy metabolism and substrate utilization in working muscle. The initial VO2max determined before training on the eight male subjects was 53.0 +/- 2.0 (SE) ml.kg-1.min-1. Analysis of samples obtained by needle biopsy from the vastus lateralis muscle before exercise (0 min) and at 15, 60, and 99 min of exercise indicated that on the average training resulted (P less than 0.05) in a 6.5% higher concentration of creatine phosphate, a 9.9% lower concentration of creatine, and a 39% lower concentration of lactate. Training had no effect on ATP concentration. These adaptations were also accompanied by a reduction in the utilization in glycogen such that by the end of exercise glycogen concentration was 47.1% higher in the trained muscle. Analysis of the maximal activities of representative enzymes of different metabolic pathways and segments indicated no change in potential in the citric acid cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase), beta-oxidation (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase), glucose phosphorylation (hexokinase), or potential for glycogenolysis (phosphorylase) and glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase). With the exception of increases in the capillary-to-fiber area ratio in type IIa fibers, no change was found in any fiber type (types I, IIa, and IIb) for area, number of capillaries, capillary-to-fiber area ratio, or oxidative potential with training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
