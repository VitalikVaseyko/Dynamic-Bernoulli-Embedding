The reaction of rats and rabbits to long-term application of acidified drinking water (pH 2.3-2.5) was observed over a 7-months period. The following parameters were studied: growth curves initiated at weaning, haematology, blood glucose, total serum protein, creatinine, inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase, serum glutamate oxalacetate transaminase, and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase in serum as well as the acid-base status in arterial blood; in addition in rabbits gamma-glutamyl transferase and lactate dehydrogenase were examined in the serum. No significant changes were seen in comparison to the control groups.
