The unique pattern of anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism in invertebrate facultative anaerobes serves to couple other substrate-level phosphorylations to the glycolytic reactions, thus increasing the potential yield of high-energy phosphate compounds. Currently, two important coupling sites can be identified:
