Glycolytic activity was measured in red cells from epileptic patients treated with anticonvulsant drugs. These results are compared with measurements of red cell glycolytic activity from megaloblastic anaemia patients and normal controls. The differences obtained between epileptic patients and controls, as well as the differences between anaemia, epileptic patients and controls is discussed.
