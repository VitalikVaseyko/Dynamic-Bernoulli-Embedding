The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in human adipose tissue (AT) of newborns aged 0-2 and 2-48 h, of 3- to 5-month-old infants and of adults. AT was sampled by means of a special needle from the gluteal region without anesthesia. We observed significantly higher activity of the two pentose phosphate shunt enzymes when calculated on protein content and wet weight basis in newborns as compared to infants and adults. There were no differences for PK and LDH between newborns and adults when the values were calculated for the soluble protein. The protein concentration of the AT decreased significantly during the development.
