The possibility of reducing ammonium concentration in the blood of mice with hyperammonemia with ammocytes (erythrocytes loaded with glutamate synthase) and the metabolic characteristics of these cells were studied. Injection of ammocytes into the blood stream of animals with hyperammonemia led to reduction of the blood ammonium concentration within the first 30-120 min and this activity of ammocytes was retained for at least 2 days. Endogenous phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase in ammocytes remained at the levels of catalytic activities characteristic of intact erythrocytes. Hence, ammocytes are functionally active cells and can be used as a protective system in pathological hyperammonemia, while the method can be regarded as a new technology for medicine and veterinary.
