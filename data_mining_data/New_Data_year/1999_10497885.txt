Chronic sepsis promotes a stable increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) activity in skeletal muscle. PDHK is found tightly bound to the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and as free kinase. We investigated the ability of sepsis to modify the activity of the PDHK intrinsic to the PDH and free PDHK. Sepsis was induced by the intraabdominal introduction of a fecal-agar pellet infected with E. coli and B. fragilis. Five days later, mitochondria were isolated from skeletal muscle and PDHK measured in mitochondrial extracts. Sepsis caused an approximate 2-fold stimulation of PDHK. The mitochondrial extracts from control and septic rats were fractionated by gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 to separate PDHK intrinsic to PDH complex and free PDHK. PDH complex eluted at void volume and was assayed for PDHK intrinsic to the complex. The activity of PDHK intrinsic to PDH complex was a significantly increased 3 fold during sepsis. Free PDHK activity eluted after the PDH complex and its activity was enhanced by 70% during sepsis. Incubation of PDHK intrinsic to PDH with dichloroactate, an uncompetitive inhibitor of PDHK, showed the PDHK from septic rats relatively less sensitive to inhibition than controls. These results indicate that sepsis induces stable changes in PDHK in skeletal muscle.
