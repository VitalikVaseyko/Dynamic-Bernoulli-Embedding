The interactions of the isozymes of pyruvate kinase with cellular structure have been studied in the major tissues of the mouse during development. Overall, these data provide a firm indication that the interactions between this enzyme and cellular structure are appreciable in most tissues during all stages of development, and an analysis of the isozyme status of the enzyme in both soluble and bound compartments has been effected. Evidence has been provided that the A4 form of pyruvate kinase interacts to a greater extent with subcellular structure than does the C4 form, and the C4 form in turn interacts to a greater extent to subcellular structure than does the B4 form.
