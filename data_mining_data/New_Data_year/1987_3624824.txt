Muscle cells were cultured from six patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and nine normal subjects. Protein and myosin content and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity were similar in normal and Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures. Creatine kinase (CK) activity was lower in Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures and the isoenzyme distribution indicated MB-CK was significantly lower, while BB-CK was significantly higher in later Duchenne muscular dystrophy cultures. This abnormal isoenzyme pattern suggested aberrant or impaired maturation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy myotubes in vitro.
