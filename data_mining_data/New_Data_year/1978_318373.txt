1. The relationships between food intake self-selection and liver substrates (glycogen, fat) or activities of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, acetyl CoA carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were determined during the spontaneous variations of body weight in the dormouse. 2. The results show that during the phase of increasing body weight, carbohydrate intake and enzyme activities involved in lipogenesis are on a high level. 3. On the last part of the body weight increasing phase, when lipid intake occurs, lipogenesis is depressed and a gluconeogenetic activity is set on, while total caloric intake is important and body weight is still increasing. 4. These metabolic changes are interpreted as a preparation to hibernating conditions in the dormouse.
