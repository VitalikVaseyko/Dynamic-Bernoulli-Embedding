Glycolytic metabolism has been assessed by studying a set of key enzymes, in anterior cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus septum and hippocampus, in thyroidectomized rats. The reversibility of the changes induced by the thyroidectomy has been assessed by replacement therapy. In thyroidectomized rats the hexokinase activity was significantly decreased in anterior cortex and hypothalamus. The increase in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activity was probably due to an increase in cellular energy requirements. Hexokinase activity was best restored by treatment with L-thyroxine (T4) or T4+ propylthiouracil (PTU). The low response of pyruvate kinase activity in all treated animals could suggest that this metabolic step is the least reversible.
