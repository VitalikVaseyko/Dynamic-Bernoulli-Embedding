Extracts of human liver were found to contain activities which copurified and coeluted with the two major subtypes of mediators (type A and type P) isolated from insulin-stimulated rat liver. The putative type A mediator from human liver inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart, decreased phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels in rat hepatoma cells, and stimulated lipogenesis in rat adipocytes. The putative type P mediator stimulated bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. Both fractions were able to stimulate proliferation of EGFR T17 fibroblasts and the type A was able to support growth in organotypic cultures of chicken embryo cochleovestibular ganglia. Both activities were resistant to Pronase treatment and the presence of carbohydrates, phosphate, and free-amino groups were confirmed in the two fractions. These properties are consistent with the structure/ function characteristics of the type A and P inositolphosphoglycans (IPG) previously characterized from rat liver. Further, the ability of the human-derived mediators to interact with rat adipocytes and bovine-derived metabolic enzymes suggests similarity in structure between the mediators purified from different species. Galactose oxidase-susceptible membrane-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI) have been proposed to be the precursors of IPG. GPI was purified from human liver membranes followed by treatment with galactose oxidase and reduction with NaB3H4. Serial t.l.c. revealed three radiolabeled bands which comigrated with the putative GPI precursors found in rat liver. These galactose-oxidase-reactive lipidic compounds, however, were only partially susceptible to hydrolysis with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis and were resistant to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Trypanosoma brucei. These data indicate that IPG molecules with insulin-like biological activities are present in human liver.
