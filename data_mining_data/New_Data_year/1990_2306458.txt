A fast and reliable two-step method has been established for the chemical synthesis of 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate, 6-thioguanosine 5'-diphosphate and 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate starting from the ribonucleoside. In the first step, 6-thioguanosine dissolved in triethyl phosphate, at high yield reacts with phosphorus oxide trichloride to 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate which is purified by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex using a step gradient of hydrochloric acid. In the second step, 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate dissolved in water, reacts with phosphoric acid in the presence of pyridine/dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and is converted to 6-thioguanosine 5'-diphosphate and 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate which are separated from each other and from the 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex using a gradient of ammonium bicarbonate. Material from each step of the preparation procedure is separated by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography and analyzed for its free ribonucleoside content, 5'-monophosphate, 5'-diphosphate, 5'-triphosphate and small amounts of unidentified phosphorylated compounds. The purity of the final preparations and the identity of each 6-thioguanosine 5'-phosphate are proven by highly specific enzymatic peak-shifting/HPLC analyses using alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, pyruvate kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase and combined hexokinase/glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
