This study was designed to understand the mechanism and functional implication of the two heterozygous mutations (H391Y and K422R) of human pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme (PKM(2)) observed earlier in a Bloom syndrome background. The co-expression of homotetrameric wild type and mutant PKM(2) in the cellular milieu resulting in the interaction between the two at the monomer level was substantiated further by in vitro experiments. The cross-monomer interaction significantly altered the oligomeric state of PKM(2) by favoring dimerization and heterotetramerization. In silico study provided an added support in showing that hetero-oligomerization was energetically favorable. The hetero-oligomeric populations of PKM(2) showed altered activity and affinity, and their expression resulted in an increased growth rate of Escherichia coli as well as mammalian cells, along with an increased rate of polyploidy. These features are known to be essential to tumor progression. This study provides insight in understanding the modulated role of large oligomeric multifunctional proteins such as PKM(2) by affecting cellular behavior, which is an essential observation to understand tumor sustenance and progression and to design therapeutic intervention in future.
