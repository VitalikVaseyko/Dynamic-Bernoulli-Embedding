Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of non-apoptotic cell death in multiple human diseases. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying ferroptosis remain poorly defined. First, we demonstrated that lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH), which is a DNA methylation modifier, interacted with WDR76 to inhibit ferroptosis by activating lipid metabolism-associated genes, including GLUT1, and ferroptosis related genes SCD1 and FADS2, in turn, involved in the Warburg effect. WDR76 targeted these genes expression in dependent manner of LSH and chromatin modification in DNA methylation and histone modification. These effects were dependent on iron and lipid reactive oxygen species. We further demonstrated that EGLN1 and c-Myc directly activated the expression of LSH by inhibiting HIF-1alpha. Finally, we demonstrated that LSH functioned as an oncogene in lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our study elucidates the molecular basis of the c-Myc/EGLN1-mediated induction of LSH expression that inhibits ferroptosis, which can be exploited for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of cancer.
