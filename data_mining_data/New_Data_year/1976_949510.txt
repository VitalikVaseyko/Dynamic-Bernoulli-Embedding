1. The metabolic response of livers to perfusion with ethanol with and without avenaciolide, has been followed by measuring the perfusate levels of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, ethanol, amino acids, urea and lipid. 2. Analysis of the perfused livers showed changes in the activities of some of the key enzymes of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Ethanol perfusion decreased the levels of phosphofructokinase, glucokinase and cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase, while avenaciolide lowered pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase as well as glucokinase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase were unchanged, but the ionophore increased the level of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase. Ethanol plus avenaciolide showed the same pattern as ethanol alone, together with the decrease in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase found with avenaciolide. 3. Neither ethanol nor avenaciolide had any effect on kexokinase, pyruvate kinase or acetyl-CoA carboxylase. There were small changes in glucose-6-phosphatase and malic enzyme, and a tendency for citrate lyase levels to decline in avenaciolide perfusions.
