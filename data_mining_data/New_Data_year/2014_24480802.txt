Metabolic reprogramming is one of the critical features in cancer. Tumor cells preferentially utilize glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen, namely 'Warburg Effect'. Recent studies have provided new insights into the Warburg effect, elucidating metabolic-dependent and independent mechanisms of metabolic enzymes regulated by post-translational modifications and providing further evidence for the critical role of these tricks in cancer metabolism and tumorigenesis. Of particular interest, we summarized the latest advances in both the metabolic and the non-metabolic functions of metabolic enzymes via the acetylation regulation in the Warburg effect. In addition, their potential roles in cancer metabolism therapy will also be briefly discussed.
