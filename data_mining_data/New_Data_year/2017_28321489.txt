The reprogramming of glucose metabolism from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, known as the Warburg effect, is an anomalous characteristic of cancer cell metabolism. Recent studies have revealed a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) that play critical roles in regulating the reprogramming of glucose metabolism in cancer cells. These miRNAs regulate cellular glucose metabolism by directly targeting multiple metabolic genes, including those encoding key glycolytic enzymes. In the first part of this review, we summarized the recent knowledge of miRNA regulation in the reprogramming of glucose metabolism in cancer cells and discussed the potential utilization of the key miRNA regulators as metabolic targets for developing new antitumor agents. Then, we summarized recent advances in methods and techniques for studying miRNA regulation in cancer cell metabolism.
