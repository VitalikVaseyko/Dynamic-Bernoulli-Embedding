ADP, generated from red blood cells is believed to be responsible for the spontaneous aggregation of platelets in whole blood. This notion is based mainly on the use of enzymes which remove ADP. We have studied spontaneous platelet aggregation in whole blood and autologous platelet rich plasma obtained from 12 healthy male and female volunteers. Platelet aggregation was quantitated by measuring the fall in the number of single platelets counted using a whole blood platelet counter (Ultra Flo 100). In a rotating tube model, the mean fall in the number of platelets due to spontaneous aggregation was 56% in whole blood but, only 3% in platelet rich plasma prepared from the same blood samples. Spontaneous platelet aggregation in whole blood was unaffected by apyrase grade I, but was reduced to 15% by apyrase grade II, to 38% by creatine phosphokinase/creatine phosphate and to 9% by pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate. The results of this study provide additional evidence that ADP generated in whole blood triggers the spontaneous aggregation of platelets.
