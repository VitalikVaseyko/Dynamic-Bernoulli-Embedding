Pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase isozymic expression have been investigated in 62 childhood cancers by electrofocusing and immunoneutralization. Isozymic expression was roughly intermediate between that of the corresponding normal adult and fetal tissue. There were unique features distinguishing malignant from both adult and fetal tissues. In addition, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase appeared to be excellent markers for nervous tissue and skeletal muscle differentiation. In neuroblastomas there was a close relationship between the differentiation level of tumors and their isozyme composition. The same phenomenon was observed in rhabdomyosarcomas and teratomas.
