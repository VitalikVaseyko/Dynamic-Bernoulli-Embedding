The complete amino acid sequence of cat muscle pyruvate kinase has been determined and fitted to the 2.6 A resolution electron density map. Residues in the active site region are highly conserved in the cat muscle, chicken muscle, rat liver and yeast enzymes. The enzyme-bound magnesium, which is essential for activity, interacts with the side chain of glutamate-271 and with two main carbonyl groups. Lysine-269 is the probable acid/base catalyst responsible for the interconversion of pyruvate and enolpyruvate. A possible binding site for the essential monovalent cation is proposed.
