The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate in mitochondria. The PDC activity is regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle catalyzed by specific kinases (PDK) and phosphatases (PDP). In this study, the regulatory mechanisms of PDC were examined in skeletal muscle of the spontaneously diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat before and after the onset of diabetes. The Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rat was used as control. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were at normal levels in both groups at 8 weeks of age but were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats at 25 weeks of age (1.2-fold for glucose and 15-fold for insulin), indicating development of diabetes in the former. Plasma free fatty acids were 1.6-fold concentrated and the skeletal muscle PDC activity state was significantly lower in OLETF than in LETO rats at both ages, suggesting suppression of pyruvate oxidation in OLETF rats even before the onset of diabetes. The PDK activity and the abundance of the PDK isoform 4 protein as well as mRNA were greater in OLETF rats at both ages. Conversely, the abundance of the PDP isoform 1 protein and mRNA was less in OLETF than in LETO rats at both ages. These results suggest that concomitant greater PDK4 and less PDP1 expression in skeletal muscle of OLETF rats before the onset of diabetes are responsible for the lowering of the PDC activity and may be related with the development of diabetes mellitus.
