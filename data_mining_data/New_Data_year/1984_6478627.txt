Erythrocytes from individuals with Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) were fractionated on Percoll density gradients. The osmotic fragility, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count and cell morphology of the fractions showed that the gradients separate the erythrocytes according to age, the older small spherocytes appearing in the dense fractions. Comparison of the well established parameters of erythrocyte ageing, pyruvate kinase activity, acetylcholinesterase activity and cell potassium content in normal and HS erythrocyte fractions of similar age revealed abnormalities in the senescence of HS erythrocytes both before and after splenectomy.
