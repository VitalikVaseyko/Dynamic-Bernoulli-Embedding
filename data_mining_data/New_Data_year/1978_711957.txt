The fixation of [14C]bicarbonate into aspartate by Streptococcus lactis C10 was achieved by the combined reactions of pyruvate carboxylase (E.C. 6.4.1.1) and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (E.C. 2.6.1.1). The pyruvate carboxylase from Str. lactis C10, which was most active at pH 8.0, was activated by the divalent metal ions Mn2+, Mg2+ and Co2+, and inhibited by sulphydryl reagents. The enzyme was inhibited non-competitively by aspartic acid and competitively by oxaloacetate.
