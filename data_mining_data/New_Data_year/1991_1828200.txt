The above study was intended to assess the effect of a bicarbonate sulfate alkaline water of medium mineral contents in long-distance runners during training. Several parameters relating to water-electrolyte and lactate-pyruvate metabolism, and to the patterns of serum enzymes of variable cellular localization were determined. Altogether twelve indices were taken into account. No significant changes were observed fron the start to the end of mineral water treatment. This goes to show that training was well balanced and did not impair the athletes' biochemical homeostasis. At the end of the treatment period, non negligible fluctuations of CCK and LDH were observed. This finding is not devoid of interest and deserves further study.
