1. The purpose of this study was to determine the nature of the metabolic changes associated with carbohydrate and fat metabolism that occurred in the blood and liver of lactating dairy cows during starvation for 6 days. 2. During starvation, the blood concentrations of the free fatty acids and ketone bodies increased, whereas that of citrate decreased. After an initial increase, the blood concentration of glucose subsequently declined as starvation progressed. Starvation caused a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of serine and a significant increase in that of leucine. 3. After 6 days of starvation the hepatic concentrations of oxaloacetate, citrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 3-phosphoglycerate, glucose, glycogen, ATP and NAD(+) had all decreased, as had the hepatic activities of phosphopyruvate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.32) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40). 4. The above metabolic changes are similar to those previously found to occur in cows suffering from spontaneous ketosis (Baird et al., 1968; Baird & Heitzman, 1971). 5. Milk yield decreased progressively during starvation. 6. There were marked differences in the ability of individual animals to resist the onset of severe starvation ketosis.
