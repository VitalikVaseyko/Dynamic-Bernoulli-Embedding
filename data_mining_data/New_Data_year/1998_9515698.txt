The regulatory protein AlgR2 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa positively regulates nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) and succinyl-CoA synthetase, enzymes critical in nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) formation. AlgR2 positively regulates the production of alginate, GTP, ppGpp and inorganic polyphosphate (poly P). An algR2 mutant with low levels of these metabolites has them restored by introducing and overexpressing either the algR2 or the ndk gene into the algR2 mutant. Thus, Ndk is involved in the formation of these compounds and largely prevents the death of the algR2 mutant, which occurs early in the stationary phase. We demonstrate that the 12 kDa Ndk-pyruvate kinase (Pk) complex, previously shown to generate predominantly GTP instead of all the NTPs, has a low affinity for the deoxynucleoside diphosphates and cannot generate the dNTPs needed for DNA replication and cell division; this complex may thus be involved in regulating the levels of both NTPs and dNTPs that modulate cell division and survival in the stationary phase.
