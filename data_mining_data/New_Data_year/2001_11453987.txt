In isolated rat hepatocytes, it has previously been reported that a rise in the ATP content induces a proportional increase in cytosolic NAD+ concentration [Devin, A., Guerin, B. & Rigoulet, M. (1997) FEBS Lett. 410, 329-332]. This occurs under physiological conditions such as various substrates or different energetic states. To investigate the effect of a physiological rise in cytosolic [NAD+] per se on glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, an increase in [NAD+] induced by exogenous nicotinamide addition was obtained without a change in redox potential, ATP/ADP ratio and ATP concentration. Using dihydroxyacetone as substrate, we found that an increase in cytosolic [NAD+] decreases gluconeogenesis and enhances glycolysis without significant alteration of dihydroxyacetone consumption rate. These modifications are the consequence of an allosteric activation of pyruvate kinase via cytosolic NAD+ content. Thus, in addition to the well-known thermodynamic control of glycolysis by pyridine-nucleotide redox status, our study points to a new mechanism of glycolytic flux regulation by NAD+ concentration at the level of pyruvate kinase activity.
