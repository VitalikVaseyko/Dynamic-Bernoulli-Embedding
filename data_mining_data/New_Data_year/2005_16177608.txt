At the onset of constant-load exercise, pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO(2)) exhibits a monoexponential increase, following a brief time delay, to a new steady state. To date, the specific factors controlling VO(2) onset kinetics during the transition to higher rates of work remain largely unknown. To study the control of respiration in the absence of confounding factors such as blood flow heterogeneity and fiber type recruitment patterns, the onset kinetics of mitochondrial respiration were studied at the start of contractions in isolated single myocytes. Individual myocytes were microinjected with a porphyrin compound to allow phosphorescent measurement of intracellular PO(2) (P(i)O(2), an analog of VO(2)). Peak tension and P(i)O(2) were continuously monitored under a variety of conditions designed to test the role of work intensity, extracellular PO(2), cellular metabolites, and enzyme activation on the regulation of VO(2) onset kinetics.
