Zucker diabetic fatty rats develop type 2 diabetes concomitantly with peripheral insulin resistance. Hepatocytes from these rats and their control lean counterparts have been cultured, and a number of key parameters of glucose metabolism have been determined. Glucokinase activity was 4.5-fold lower in hepatocytes from diabetic rats than in hepatocytes from healthy ones. In contrast, hexokinase activity was about 2-fold higher in hepatocytes from diabetic animals than in healthy ones. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was not significantly different. Despite the altered ratios of glucokinase to hexokinase activity, intracellular glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were similar in the two types of cells when they where incubated with 1-25 mM glucose. However, glycogen levels and glycogen synthase activity ratio were lower in hepatocytes from diabetic animals. Total pyruvate kinase activity and its activity ratio as well as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration and lactate production were also lower in cells from diabetic animals. All of these data indicate that glucose metabolism is clearly impaired in hepatocytes from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Glucokinase overexpression using adenovirus restored glucose metabolism in diabetic hepatocytes. In glucokinase-overexpressing cells, glucose 6-phosphate levels increased. Moreover, glycogen deposition was greatly enhanced due to the activation of glycogen synthase. Pyruvate kinase was also activated, and fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration and lactate production were increased in glucokinase-overexpressing diabetic hepatocytes. Overexpression of hexokinase I did not increase glycogen deposition. In conclusion, hepatocytes from Zucker diabetic fatty rats showed depressed glycogen and glycolytic metabolism, but glucokinase overexpression improved their glucose utilization and storage.
