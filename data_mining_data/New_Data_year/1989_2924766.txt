We describe in this paper a method for studying transient gene expression in a primary culture of adult rat hepatocytes. After isolation by collagenase perfusion, hepatocytes in a monolayer were transfected with foreign DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique during the first 24 hours after plating. When they were transfected with a plasmid containing the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase driven by the early promoter of simian virus 40, hepatocytes reproducibly expressed high levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT); this transient expression was much higher than that obtained with the rat hepatoma cell line H4II. Different medium conditions have been tested; an optimal level of CAT activity can be obtained using a serum-free, hormonally defined medium. Using these techniques, we have investigated the expression of liver-specific genes transferred into hepatocytes. We show that the L-pyruvate kinase promoter is active in these hepatocytes while it is silent in fibroblasts. Moreover, the use of serum-free medium may allow investigation of the role of hormones and nutrients in cells which respond normally to these effectors.
