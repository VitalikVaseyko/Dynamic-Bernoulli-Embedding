Warburg effect is a hallmark of cancer manifested by continuous prevalence of glycolysis and dysregulation of oxidative metabolism. Glycolysis provides survival advantage to cancer cells. To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect, we first compared oxygen consumption among hFOB osteoblasts, benign osteosarcoma cells, Saos2, and aggressive osteosarcoma cells, 143B. We demonstrate that, as both proliferation and invasiveness increase in osteosarcoma, cells utilize significantly less oxygen. We proceeded to evaluate mitochondrial morphology and function. Electron microscopy showed that in 143B cells, mitochondria are enlarged and increase in number. Quantitative PCR revealed an increase in mtDNA in 143B cells when compared with hFOB and Saos2 cells. Gene expression studies showed that mitochondrial single-strand DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), a key catalyst of mitochondrial replication, was significantly up-regulated in 143B cells. In addition, increased levels of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes were accompanied by significant reduction of their activities. These changes indicate hyperactive mitochondrial replication in 143B cells. Forced overexpression of mtSSB in Saos2 cells caused an increase in mtDNA and a decrease in oxygen consumption. In contrast, knockdown of mtSSB in 143B cells was accompanied by a decrease in mtDNA, increase in oxygen consumption, and retardation of cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we have found that mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells correlates with abnormally increased mitochondrial replication, which according to our gain- and loss-of-function experiments, may be due to overexpression of mtSSB. Our study provides insight into mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer and may offer potential therapeutic targets.
