PKCdelta has emerged as a novel regulatory molecule of oxidative phosphorylation by targeting the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). We showed that activation of PKCdelta leads to the dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2), thereby decreasing PDK2 activity and increasing PDH activity, accelerating oxygen consumption, and augmenting ATP synthesis. However, the molecular components that mediate PKCdelta signaling in mitochondria have remained elusive so far. Here, we identify for the first time a functional complex, which includes cytochrome c as the upstream driver of PKCdelta, and uses the adapter protein p66Shc as a platform with vitamin A (retinol) as a fourth partner. All four components are necessary for the activation of the PKCdelta signal chain. Genetic ablation of any one of the three proteins, or retinol depletion, silences signaling. Furthermore, mutations that disrupt the interaction of cytochrome c with p66Shc, of p66Shc with PKCdelta, or the deletion of the retinol-binding pocket on PKCdelta, attenuate signaling. In cytochrome c-deficient cells, reintroduction of cytochrome c Fe(3+) protein restores PKCdelta signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that oxidation of PKCdelta is key to the activation of the pathway. The PKCdelta/p66Shc/cytochrome c signalosome might have evolved to effect site-directed oxidation of zinc-finger structures of PKCdelta, which harbor the activation centers and the vitamin A binding sites. Our findings define the molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling function of PKCdelta in mitochondria.
