The dynamic pattern of an open reconstituted in-vitro enzyme system containing phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and adenylate kinase has been investigated. The approach is experimentally based on a stirred flow-through reactor. Stationary concentrations of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are maintained by entrapment in polyacrylamide gel particles. The results fit to a theoretical model based on the initial kinetic responses of the enzymes involved. An S-shaped steady state input characteristic for fructose 6-phosphate has been experimentally obtained.
