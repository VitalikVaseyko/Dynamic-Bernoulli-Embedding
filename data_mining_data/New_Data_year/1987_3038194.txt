Caloric restriction reduces the incidence and progression of a broad spectrum of neoplastic diseases, yet little is known about the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved. Profiles of enzyme activities of importance in cellular energy utilization were examined in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced (DMBA) mammary adenocarcinomas from rats fed ad libitum or calorically restricted diets. The diets provided equal nutrients except for fewer carbohydrate-derived calories; graded caloric restriction was 10, 20, 30 and 40%. The specific activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase were all elevated to varying degrees in both large palpable and small, non-palpable tumors from calorically restricted hosts compared to activities in tumors from ad libitum-fed rats. Phosphofructokinase activity was increased in palpable tumors from calorically restricted hosts but markedly reduced in non-palpable tumors. These results suggest adaptive or compensatory alterations in tumor enzyme profiles in response to the altered nutritional state of the host.
