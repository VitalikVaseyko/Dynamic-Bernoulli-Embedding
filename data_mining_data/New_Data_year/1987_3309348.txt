The total sequence of a 13,021 base-pair (bp) genomic fragment containing the rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene was determined by "shot gun" sequencing. This fragment includes 8360 bp of the L-PK gene, plus 3193 bp of the 5'-flanking and 1468 bp of the 3'-flanking regions. Like the chicken PK-M1 gene, the rat L-PK gene exhibits a fully conserved exon-intron structure, with 11 exons and 10 introns. In the chicken M1 gene, the coding sequences are well conserved (about 70%), in particular at the level of the exons implicated in the formation of PK active sites, exons that are also partially homologous to the corresponding sequences of the yeast gene. Various types of repetitive sequences exist in the L-PK gene, especially two ID (identifier) sequences located in the second intron and the 11th exon. Elements very similar to the "cyclic AMP-dependent regulatory element" recently described in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and somatostatin genes are found in the sequenced fragment, but far upstream (-2338) and downstream (+5788) from the cap site. Various sequences homologous to described regulatory elements (glucocorticoid regulatory elements, enhancers, potential Z-DNA) are also observed 5' and 3' of the cap site. A comparison of the 5'-flanking region of the L-PK gene with the same regions of liver-specific or non-specific, cyclic-AMP-responsive or non-responsive genes was also made. It revealed various potentially interesting features that will be used to guide a further functional study. The cap site was determined by primer extension and nuclease S1 mapping using either mature mRNA or precursor RNA as templates. With both templates the start site of transcription appeared to be microheterogeneous, 19 to 14 bp before the ATG translation initiation codon.
