Parasitic nematodes of ruminants can be expected to experience temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C in faeces on pasture and, perhaps, in the host. L3 Ostertagia (Teladorsagia) circumcincta survived for at least 90 min at 45 degrees C in vitro in water, but the larvae were inactivated rapidly by only slightly higher temperatures. The glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and pyruvate kinase were inactivated in a similar temperature range, whereas malate dehydrogenase maintained its activity at temperatures in excess of 50 degrees C. These data imply that the loss of glycolytic activity might explain the loss of larval motility at temperatures between 45 degrees C and 50 degrees C.
