Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen of periodontal diseases, including periodontitis. We have investigated the effect of P. gingivalis infection on the PI3K/Akt (protein kinase B) signaling pathway in gingival epithelial cells. Here, we found that live P. gingivalis, but not heat-killed P. gingivalis, reduced Akt phosphorylation at both Thr-308 and Ser-473, which implies a decrease in Akt activity. Actually, PI3K, which is upstream of Akt, was also inactivated by P. gingivalis. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta, mammalian target of rapamycin, and Bad, which are downstream proteins in the PI3K/Akt cascade, were also dephosphorylated, a phenomenon consistent with Akt inactivation by P. gingivalis. However, these events did not require direct interaction between bacteria and host cells and were independent of P. gingivalis invasion into the cells. The use of gingipain-specific inhibitors and a gingipain-deficient P. gingivalis mutant KDP136 revealed that the gingipains and their protease activities were essential for the inactivation of PI3K and Akt. The associations between the PI3K regulatory subunit p85alpha and membrane proteins were disrupted by wild-type P. gingivalis. Moreover, PDK1 translocation to the plasma membrane was reduced by wild-type P. gingivalis, but not KDP136, indicating little production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate by PI3K. Therefore, it is likely that PI3K failed to transmit homeostatic extracellular stimuli to intracellular signaling pathways by gingipains. Taken together, our findings indicate that P. gingivalis attenuates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via the proteolytic effects of gingipains, resulting in the dysregulation of PI3K/Akt-dependent cellular functions and the destruction of epithelial barriers.
