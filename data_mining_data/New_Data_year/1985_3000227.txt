Numerous isoenzymes are used as markers in the course of malignant haemopathies. These are notably the isoenzymes of lactic dehydrogenase, hexosaminidase, esterases, acid phosphatases, and thymidine kinase. Their study already permits a finer and more rigorous classification of leukaemias and makes it possible to entertain serious hopes in at least three spheres: a better choice of treatment, surveillance of therapeutic efficacy and of remissions, and the development of new modes of therapeutic action by means of selective inhibitors.
