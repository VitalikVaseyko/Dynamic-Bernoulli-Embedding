Neutrophils infiltration/activation following wound induction marks the early inflammatory response in wound repair. However, the role of the infiltrated/activated neutrophils in tissue regeneration/proliferation during wound repair is not well understood. Here, we report that infiltrated/activated neutrophils at wound site release pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) by its secretive mechanisms during early stages of wound repair. The released extracellular PKM2 facilitates early wound healing by promoting angiogenesis at wound site. Our studies reveal a new and important molecular linker between the early inflammatory response and proliferation phase in tissue repair process.
