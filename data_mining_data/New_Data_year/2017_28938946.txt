In a recent paper in Nature Medicine, Qi et al. set out to identify protective pathways in patients with longstanding diabetes who do not develop diabetic nephropathy. Unbiased proteomic analysis of kidney tissue identified a unique protein signature in unaffected individuals. Studies in vitro and in murine models identified the highly upregulated glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent or treat diabetic nephropathy.
