BACKGROUND: The therapeutic and prognostic value of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase (PK) has been implicated in a variety of cancers, while their roles in treatment of and prognosis for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) remain unclear. In this study, we determined the expression of PKM2 in and its impact on biology and clinical outcome of human HC. METHODS: The regulation and function of PKM2 in HC pathogenesis was evaluated using human tissues, molecular and cell biology, and animal models, and its prognostic significance was determined according to its impact on patient survival. RESULTS: We found that expression of hexokinase 1 and the M2 splice isoform of PK (PKM2) was upregulated in HC tissues and that this expression correlated with tumor recurrence and outcome. PKM2 expression was increased in HC cases with chronic cholangitis as demonstrated by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification. High PKM2 expression was highly correlated with high syndecan 2 (SDC2) expression and neural invasion. PKM2 downregulation led to a decrease in SDC2 expression. Treatment with metformin markedly suppressed PKM2 and SDC2 expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and inhibited HC cell proliferation and tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: PKM2 regulates neural invasion of HC cells at least in part via regulation of SDC2. Inhibition of PKM2 and SDC2 expression contributes to the therapeutic effect of metformin on HC. Therefore, PKM2 is an independent prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target for human HC.
