1. The ratio of the combined activities of hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) and glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2) to the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) changed in favour of the glycolytic enzymes during pregnancy and at peak lactation. 2. There were no important changes in the ratio of the activity of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) to that of fructose diphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11). 3. The ratio of the activity of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) to the combined activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (EE 4.1.1.32) and pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) changed in favour of the glycolytic enzyme during pregnancy and at peak lactation, but changed in favour of the gluconeogenic enzymes immediately after parturition. 4. These changes are considered in relation to the changes in food intake and hormonal status that occur during pregnancy and lactation.
