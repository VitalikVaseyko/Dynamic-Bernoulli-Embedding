Interference by some commonly used analgesic and antirheumatic drugs in the spectrophotometric and colorimetric assays of serum enzymes was examined. None of the investigated methods was significantly influenced by caffeine, phenacetin, ibuprofen or indomethacin. Acetylsalicylic acid affected the continuous assays of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (with pyruvate as substrate), and the colorimetric assay of alanine aminotransferase. Aminophenazone interfered with the colorimetric method for determination of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, while phenobarbital interfered only with the continuous method for lactate dehydrogenase (with L-lactate as substrate). Ketoprofen interfered with the colorimetric assays of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase, while diclofenac affected the continuous assay of aspartate aminotransferase. None of the tested drugs interfered with the continuous methods for the determination of alkaline phosphatase and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.
