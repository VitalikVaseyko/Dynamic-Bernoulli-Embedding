A panel of hybrid clones segregating rat chromosomes in a mouse background was used to determine the chromosomal localization of three genes specifically expressed in hepatocytes. The phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine aminotransferase, and pyruvate kinase genes were assigned to rat chromosomes 7, 19, and 2, respectively.
