Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate incorporation into pyruvate kinase II from E. coli was decreased by the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and increased by the allosteric activator ribose 5-phosphate, the total incorporation being linearly related to inactivation. Four lysyl residues were substantially modified, whatever the incubation conditions were while two additional residues became reactive only in the presence of the allosteric activator. Six tryptic peptides containing modified lysines were purified and sequenced. They defined five regions of pyruvate kinase II, since one of them contained two labelled lysines and included a peptide which also appeared independently. Sequence comparison with E. coli type I, yeast and cat muscle pyruvate kinases shows that the binding regions of pyruvate kinase II are clearly divergent from those of pyruvate kinase I and of the eukaryotic enzymes.
