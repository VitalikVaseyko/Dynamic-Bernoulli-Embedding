Myocardium and skeletal muscle of white rats have a number of specific features in metabolism of carbohydrates. The skeletal muscle is characterized by high intensity of glycolytic processes and glycolytic substrate phosphorylation, that is testified to by the activity of the terminal glycolysis stage enzymes (pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, its isoenzyme spectrum) and by the content of lactate and pyruvate metabolites. In contrast to skeletal muscles, the activity of NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase in the myocardium is significant both in cytoplasm and in mitochondria. This activity corresponds to a high level of malate and oxaloacetate metabolites and to the activity of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, playing a connective role between glycolysis, the cycle of tricarboxylic acids and glyconeogenesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, catalyzing the transformation of cytoplasmatic oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate is more active in the skeletal muscles where the intensity of the tricarboxylic acids cycle reactions is lower and the activity of glycolysis is higher than that of myocardium.
