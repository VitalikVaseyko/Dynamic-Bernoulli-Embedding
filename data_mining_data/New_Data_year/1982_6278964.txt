The oxygen affinity of canine blood changes markedly following birth. These changes are correlated with alterations in the intracellular concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). We have examined the control of erythrocyte glycolysis by measurements of intracellular enzymes and intermediates, and we have identified the component responsible for regulation of 2,3-DPG concentration and hence blood oxygen affinity during canine postnatal development. The concentration of 2,3-DPG could be regulated entirely by the enzymes of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt. We have not detected any alterations in the levels or intracellular activity of 2,3-DPG mutase or 2,3-DPG phosphatase during development; therefore postnatal changes of 2,3-DPG must be a result of changes in the intracellular concentrations of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-DPG) that are controlled by other reactions in the glycolytic pathway. Neither low intracellular concentrations of glucose, the glycolytic substrate, nor an inherently low glycolytic rate can account for the low 2,3-DPG levels at birth. 1,3-DPG concentrations and hence 2,3-DPG concentrations are controlled by the activity of pyruvate kinase, which acts as a glycolytic sink reaction. The intracellular activity of pyruvate kinase decreases during the first 50-60 days of age and causes the accumulation of 2,3-DPG. There is a subsequent change in the in vivo kinetic properties of the enzyme, giving increased intracellular activity and resulting in the slow decline of 2,3-DPG concentrations toward normal adult values.
