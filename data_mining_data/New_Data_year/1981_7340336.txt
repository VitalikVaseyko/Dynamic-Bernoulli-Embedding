The content and distribution of phospholipids (PL) in red blood cells (RBC) of PK and of G6PD deficiency were found to differ in both disorders. RBC immaturity could not be excluded as reason for PL alterations in PK deficiency. The relative diminution of phosphatidylethanolamine in G6PD deficiency may be connected with the enzyme depletion in this disorder and its influence on the PL of RBC membranes. Moist or all fatty acid deviations seem to be conditioned by RBC immaturity. Nearly all PL fatty acid aberrations in G6PD deficiency RBC were observed also in PK deficiency RBC. Additional deviations of PL fatty acids in PK deficiency RBC may be caused by the stronger immaturity of the cells in this disorder.
