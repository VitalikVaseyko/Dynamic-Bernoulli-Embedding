This paper reports on the discovery of a protein kinase activity associated with the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria. The enzyme does not respond to addition of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP and has a preference for whole histone as phosphate acceptor. Some standard assay systems for the cyclic nucleotide-dependent cytosol protein kinases would be unable to pick up this activity of the orthophosphate concentration is higher than 25 mM and the pH or the assay lower than pH 6.5. The enzyme described here has an apparent pH optimum of 8.5. Activity in liver mitochondria is not evident unless the mitochondria are disrupted by either sonication or freezing and thawing. Distribution of kinase activity in centrifugal fractions of both liver and heart mitochondrial sonicates was parallel to that of the two inner membrane marker enzymes succinic dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase and quite different from that of the matrix enzyme malic dehydrogenase. Experiments with preparations enriched in outer or inner membranes confirmed the contention that this enzyme is located on the inner membrane. Since disruption of the inner membrane by a freeze-thaw treatment (after the outer membrane had been disrupted by swelling in phosphate) was necessary for full expression of activity by this enzyme, the tentative conclusion was reached that substrate is accepted only from the matrix side of the inner membrane.
