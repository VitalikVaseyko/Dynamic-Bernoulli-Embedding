L-tryptophan (L-trp) is a precursor of various bioactive components and has great pharmaceutical interest. However, due to the requirement of several precursors and complex regulation of the pathways involved, the development of an efficient L-trp production strain is challenging. In this study, Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain KW001 was designed to overexpress the L-trp operator sequences (trpEDCBA) and 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (aroG (fbr) ). To further improve the production of L-trp, pyruvate kinase (pykF) and the phosphotransferase system HPr (ptsH) were deleted after inactivation of repression (trpR) and attenuation (attenuator) to produce strain KW006. To overcome the relatively slow growth and to increase the transport rate of glucose, strain KW018 was generated by combinatorial regulation of glucokinase (galP) and galactose permease (glk) expression. To reduce the production of acetic acid, strain KW023 was created by repressive regulation of phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) expression. In conclusion, strain KW023 efficiently produced 39.7 g/L of L-trp with a conversion rate of 16.7% and a productivity of 1.6 g/L/h in a 5 L fed-batch fermentation system.
