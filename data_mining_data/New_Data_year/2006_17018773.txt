Fiber type specificity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase (PDP) was determined in fed (CON) and 48-h food-deprived (FD) rats. PDP activity and isoform protein content were determined in soleus (slow-twitch oxidative), red gastrocnemius (RG; fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic), and white gastrocnemius (WG; fast-twitch glycolytic) muscles. When normalized for mitochondrial volume, there was no difference in PDP activity between muscle types or CON and FD. When expressed per gram wet tissue weight, PDP activity was higher in RG compared with soleus and WG in both CON and FD rats. PDP activities from CON muscles were 1.48 +/- 0.19, 2.68 +/- 0.65, and 1.20 +/- 0.33 nmol x min(-1) x g wet tissue wt(-1) in soleus, RG, and WG, respectively, and decreased in FD muscles (1.22 +/- 0.22, 2.00 +/- 0.57, and 0.84 +/- 0.18 nmol x min(-1) x g wet tissue wt(-1)). This correlated with increased PDP2 protein, however, only in RG, as PDP2 was not detectable in soleus or WG. PDP1 protein was not responsive to food deprivation in all fiber types. In conclusion, PDP activity and protein content were higher in fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic muscles from CON and FD rats, identifying a unique inter- and intramuscular distribution. FD induced a small but significant decrease in PDP activity that was partially due to decreases in PDP2 protein. As a result, coordinate changes to PDP activity opposite to those of the other regulatory enzyme, PDH kinase, during food deprivation would maximize the inactivation of skeletal muscle PDH and enhance carbohydrate conservation during periods of limited carbohydrate supply.
