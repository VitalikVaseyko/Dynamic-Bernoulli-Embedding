"Warburg effect" emphasizes that malignant cells exhibit active glycolysis even under aerobic conditions. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a key glycolytic enzyme that helps to exhibit a "Warburg effect". In the present study, the main aim was to detect the expression of HK2 in epithelial ovarian tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were used to examine the expression of HK2 in different epithelial ovarian tissues. The expression of HK2 in ovarian cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal ovarian, benign, and borderline tumors both in protein (p < 0.001) and mRNA (p < 0.05) levels. HK2 expression was significantly higher in Stage III/IV compared to Stage III (p < 0.001). Expression of HK2 in poorly-differentiated carcinoma was higher than that in well-differentiated carcinoma (p = 0.008). The level of HK2 was higher in serous groups than in non-serous groups in both protein (p = 0.008) and mRNA (p < 0.05) level. Collectively, HK2 is highly expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer, especially in serous groups. Its expression is related with clinical stage and histological differentiation.
