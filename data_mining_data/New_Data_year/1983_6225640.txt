The activities of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase were examined in liver as a function of age in Swiss albino mice. The hepatic activity of phosphofructokinase and total pyruvate dehydrogenase peaked in mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age and then decreased to a value that remained stable in mature animals older than 24 weeks of age. Yet, the activity of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form in liver remained unchanged in mice up to 12 weeks of age. As mice matured, a progressive increase in the activity of both pyruvate kinase and the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase in liver was observed while phosphofructokinase was unaltered. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, both total activity and the proportion of the enzyme in the active form, in the epididymal fat pad of the mouse showed no consistent age trend. The observed increase in the activity of both pyruvate kinase and the active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase should provide an augmented capacity for the generation of acetyl-CoA units for de novo fatty acid synthesis in livers of mature mice.
