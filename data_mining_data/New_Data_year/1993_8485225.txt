Evidence is presented of co-immobilized bioluminescent reagents which include firefly luciferase, pyruvate kinase and adenylate kinase used for an adenylate assay in bacterial cells. The changes in the ATP, ADP and AMP content induced by irradiation with a low-power He-Ne-laser depend on the laser power and irradiation dose. The data obtained suggest that laser irradiation causes the activation of adenine nucleotide synthesis de novo.
