A method is presented for the simultaneous assay of buccal enzymes by measuring reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the aid of the bioluminescence of luciferase extracts. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was shown earlier to be increased in homogeneous leukoplakias of the oral mucosa. Since smoking has been implicated as an etiologic factor of leukoplakia, G6PDH was measured in the normal buccal epithelium of cigarette smokers. No difference was found in the activity of G6PDH between smokers and nonsmokers when related to the activity of pyruvate kinase, which is known to be invariable in healthy and leukoplakic oral mucosa. A new compact kinetic luminescence analyzer is briefly described.
