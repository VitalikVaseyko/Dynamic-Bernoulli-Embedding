Cell-free extracts of Bacillus licheniformis were found to contain pyruvate carboxylase which catalyzes the reaction between pyruvate and bicarbonate to yield oxalacetate in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), acetylcoenzyme A (CoA), and manganese. The plot between the reaction velocity of the carboxylation by the partially purified pyruvate carboxylase (25-fold) and the concentration of pyruvate, bicarbonate, manganese, and ATP did not indicate a pronounced deviation from the Michaelis-Menten hyperbola. The enzyme was inhibited by avidin and aspartate. Biotin partially protected the enzyme from avidin inhibition, whereas the amount of inhibition by aspartate was dependent on the concentration of acetyl-CoA present. The intracellular concentration of acetyl-CoA did not vary significantly enough to allow control of the enzyme by this method. Extracts of 4-hr postexponential-phase cells of B. licheniformis were also found to contain phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which appears to be under catabolite repression control. It is suggested that the endogenous induction of this enzyme is the determining factor allowing the shift to gluconeogenesis from glycolysis during sporulation of glucose-grown cells.
