Unopposed PI3-kinase activity and 3'-phosphoinositide production in Jurkat T cells, due to a mutation in the PTEN tumour suppressor protein, results in deregulation of PH domain-containing proteins including the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt. In Jurkat cells, PKB/Akt is constitutively active and phosphorylated at the activation-loop residue (Thr308). 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), an enzyme that also contains a PH domain, is thought to catalyse Thr308 phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in addition to other kinase families such as PKC isoforms. It is unknown however if the loss of PTEN in Jurkat cells also results in unregulated PDK-1 activity and whether such loss impacts on activation-loop phosphorylation of other putative PDK-1 substrates such as PKC. In this study we have addressed if loss of PTEN in Jurkat T cells affects PDK-1 catalytic activity and intracellular localisation. We demonstrate that reducing the level of 3'-phosphoinositides in Jurkat cells with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3-kinase or expression of PTEN does not affect PDK-1 activity, Ser241 phosphorylation or intracellular localisation. In support of this finding, we show that the levels of PKC activation-loop phosphorylation are unaffected by reductions in the levels of 3'-phosphoinositides. Instead, the dephosphorylation that occurs on PKB/Akt at Thr308 following reductions in 3'-phosphoinositides is dependent on PP2A-like phosphatase activity. Our finding that PDK-1 functions independently of 3'-phosphoinositides in T cells is also confirmed by studies in HuT-78 T cells, a PTEN-expressing cell line with undetectable levels of 3'-phosphoinositides. We conclude therefore that loss of PTEN expression in Jurkat T cells does not impact on the PDK-1/PKC pathway and that only a subset of kinases, such as PKB/Akt, are perturbed as a consequence PTEN loss.
