In acute CCL4 intoxication of rats significantly increased activities of hepatic low-Km hexokinases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase A and pyruvate kinase M2 with concurrently decreased activities of glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, aldolase B and pyruvate kinase L were observed. The resulting enzyme pattern was apparently different from that in dietary induction. Principal component analysis revealed that the degree of enzyme deviation in the injured liver was much greater than that in the regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy and was closer to that in fetal liver or hepatoma tissue.
