4-Chloro-N-(2-{[5-trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]sulfonyl}ethyl)benzamide 3 (GSK3787) was identified as a potent and selective ligand for PPARdelta with good pharmacokinetic properties. A detailed binding study using mass spectral analysis confirmed covalent binding to Cys249 within the PPARdelta binding pocket. Gene expression studies showed that pyridylsulfone 3 antagonized the transcriptional activity of PPARdelta and inhibited basal CPT1a gene transcription. Compound 3 is a PPARdelta antagonist with utility as a tool to elucidate PPARdelta cell biology and pharmacology.
