Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is the most frequently mutated gene in clear cell renal carcinoma. Here, we identified a novel translational variant of VHL, termed VHLalpha, initiated from an alternative translational start site upstream and in frame with the ATG start codon. We showed that VHLalpha interacts with and regulates heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1), which consequently modulates pyruvate kinase transcript splicing and reprograms cellular glucose metabolism. Our study demonstrated that a novel VHL isoform may function as a tumor suppressor through inhibiting the Warburg effect.
