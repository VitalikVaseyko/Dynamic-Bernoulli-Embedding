Fru 2,6-P2 was present in isolated foetal hepatocytes at a concentration of 1.6 nmol per g cells. When foetal hepatocytes were exposed to glucagon no changes were observed either in the concentration of Fru 2,6-P2 and lactate release or in the activities of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and pyruvate kinase. Incubation of purified 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase did not change the enzyme activity. The inhibition by sn-glycerol 3-phosphate was much lower for the foetal than for adult enzyme. These results suggest that an isoenzyme of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase in foetal hepatocytes different from that of adult hepatocytes may be present.
