The actions of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on glucose metabolism, amino acid transport and enzyme inductions were studied in primary cultures of adult-rat hepatocytes and compared with the effects of insulin. PMA and insulin stimulated glycolysis 5- and 7-fold respectively. The half-maximal effective dose of PMA was 60 nM. Stimulation of glycolysis was accompanied by an insulin- or PMA-dependent and okadaic acid-sensitive activation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and pyruvate kinase, as well as by an increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Glucose production from glycogen was decreased to 50% by PMA and to 15% by insulin, whereas glycogen synthesis was stimulated 2- and 7-fold respectively. PMA also increased aminoisobutyrate uptake, induced ornithine decarboxylase and counteracted the glucagon-dependent induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. PMA strongly antagonized the hormonal activation of glycogen synthesis, but all other insulin actions assayed were not decreased by the phorbol ester. Whereas additive effects of PMA and insulin were not detected, PMA and a simultaneous increase in the glucose concentration had additive effects on glycolysis and glycogen metabolism. Cell exposure to insulin resulted in receptor autophosphorylation and a more than 10-fold activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase. PMA did not alter these effects, and also had no effect on the receptor phosphorylation status in the absence of insulin. Long-term (15 h) pretreatment of the cells with PMA abolished all PMA effects, but not the insulin effects. It is concluded that PMA does not generally antagonize the action of insulin in differentiated adult hepatocytes, and that insulin and PMA may use related signal-transduction pathways.
