Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy offers a convenient means for the rapid determination of metabolic profiles from intact malignant tissues with high resolution. The implementation of MAS-NMR spectroscopy requires minimal sample processing, hence being compatible with complementary histological or biochemical analyses. The metabolites routinely detected in (1)H MAS-NMR spectra can simultaneously inform on many of the metabolic alterations that characterize malignant cells, including altered choline metabolism and the so-called Warburg effect. Clinical MAS-NMR profiles have been attributed with diagnostic or prognostic value, correlating to disease subtype, tumor stage/grade, response to chemotherapy, and patient survival. Herein, the scientific rationale behind MAS-NMR and its utility for translational cancer research and patient stratification is summarized. Moreover, a basic protocol for the analysis of tumor samples by MAS-NMR spectroscopy is detailed.
