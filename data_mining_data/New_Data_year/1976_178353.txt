The chemical synthesis of adenosine 5'-(O-1-thiotriphosphate) (ATPalphaS) and adenosine 5'-(O-2-thiotriphosphate) (ATPbetaS) is described. Both exist as a pair of diastereomers, A and B. The isomers of ATPalphaS can be distinguished on the basis of their different reaction rates with myokinase as well as nucleoside diphosphate kinase. With both enzymes, isomer A reacts fast whereas isomer B reacts considerably more slowly. Phosphorylation of a mixture of isomers of ADPalphaS with pyruvate or acetate kinase yields ATPalphaS, isomer A, whereas the phosphoryl transfer with creatine or arginine kinase yields isomer B. The isomers of ATPbetaS differ in their reactivity with myosin. Isomer A is readily hydrolyzed, whereas isomer B is not. However, isomer B reacts faster with nucleoside diphosphate kinase and ADP than isomer A. Phosphoryl transfer with pyruvate kinase onto ADPbetaS yields ATPbetaS, isomer A, with acetate kinase, isomer B.
