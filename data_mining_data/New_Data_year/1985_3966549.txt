The glycogen storage disorder (gsd/gsd) rat has little or no phosphorylase kinase activity in the liver and is unable to break down liver glycogen on fasting. Nevertheless, gsd/gsd rats do not become hypoglycaemic on fasting. Gsd/gsd rats showed a decreased rate of glucose turnover measured with [6-3H]glucose. Perfused livers from gsd/gsd rats showed decreased rates of gluconeogenesis from lactate and alanine when the results were expressed per gram of liver, but the total glucose produced per liver was normal. Measurement of gluconeogenesis in vivo using [14C]-bicarbonate showed that gsd/gsd rats had a decreased rate of glucose production from substrates that enter the gluconeogenic pathway before pyruvate. We conclude that gsd/gsd rats have adapted to unavailability of liver glycogen by decreasing peripheral uptake of glucose and not by increasing gluconeogenesis.
