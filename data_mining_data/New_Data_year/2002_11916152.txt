Human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase was modified with bromopyruvate and the kinetic behavior of the modified enzyme was investigated. When the enzyme was modified with bromopyruvate in the absence of adenosine-5'-diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate or fructose-1,6-diphosphate the inactivation followed a pseudo first-order kinetics. The inactivation rate constant, ks, was 1.84 +/- 0.15 min(-1). Kd of the bromopyruvate-enzyme complex was 0.14 +/- 0.03 mM. The presence of adenosine-5'-diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate or fructose-1,6-diphosphate in the modification medium or the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate in the assay medium resulted in deviation of the inactivation kinetics from pseudo first-order. Phosphoenolpyruvate was better than adenosine-5'-diphosphate for protection against bromopyruvate modification whereas fructose-1,6-diphosphate was ineffective. The modified enzyme showed negative cooperativity in the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate whereas in the absence of it no activity was detected.
