The present study investigated the changes in carbohydrate metabolism of eggs of the whitefish, Coregonus spp. during embryogenesis (unfertilized eggs to embryos in the eyed stage). Occurrence of glycolysis was proved by activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK-1) and pyruvate kinase and by decreasing levels of hexose, pentose phosphate pathway by transaldolase (non-oxidative path) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities (oxidative path) and by increasing ribose levels, fructose synthesis (polyol pathway) by sorbitol dehydrogenase activities, gluconeogenesis by activities of glucose-6-phosphatase. Glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway had highest activities up to the epiboly stage, gluconeogenesis from epiboly stage to the eyed embryo stage. Coregonus spp. eggs contained hexoses, ketoses, 6-deoxyhexoses, heptoses and uronic acids with hexoses, ketoses, and 6-deoxysugars occurring free and in bound form. Hexoses were found in highest quantities, followed by ketoses, and 6-deoxyhexoses. Levels of these compounds changed in a specific way during embryogenesis. During all investigated stages of embryogenesis, the levels of ribose, heptose, and ketose were correlated with the percentage of eyed stage embryos developing out of the fertilized eggs (egg viability). In distinct embryonic stages, the levels of hexoses and 6-deoxyhexoses and the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase were also correlated with egg quality. This ascertains the importance of carbohydrate metabolism for developing eggs.
