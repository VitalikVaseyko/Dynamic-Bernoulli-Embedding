Aggressive behavior and diffuse infiltrative growth are the main features of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), together with the high degree of resistance and recurrence. Evidence indicate that GBM-derived stem cells (GSCs), endowed with unlimited proliferative potential, play a critical role in tumor development and maintenance. Among the many signaling pathways involved in maintaining GSC stemness, tumorigenic potential, and anti-apoptotic properties, the PDK1/Akt pathway is a challenging target to develop new potential agents able to affect GBM resistance to chemotherapy. In an effort to find new PDK1/Akt inhibitors, we rationally designed and synthesized a small family of 2-oxindole derivatives. Among them, compound 3 inhibited PDK1 kinase and downstream effectors such as CHK1, GS3Kalpha and GS3Kbeta, which contribute to GCS survival. Compound 3 appeared to be a good tool for studying the role of the PDK1/Akt pathway in GCS self-renewal and tumorigenicity, and might represent the starting point for the development of more potent and focused multi-target therapies for GBM.
