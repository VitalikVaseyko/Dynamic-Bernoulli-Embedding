Concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and adenine nucleotides have been estimated in adductor muscle and hepatopancreas from the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. after various periods of valve closure. Mass action ratios of enzyme steps involved in the metabolism of these components are compared with their equilibrium constants. This reveals hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase catalyze non-equilibrium reactions. The changes in the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates and in the rate M.A.R./Keq during hypoxia suggest that the carbon flow after valve closure is first controlled by phophofructokinase, but later on the rate of transformation of phosphoenolyruvate regulates this flow.
