Substitution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dependent enzyme has produced identical results in a number of enzyme-linked electrophoretic staining procedures. This substitution significantly reduces the cost of staining for adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, mannosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucomutase, and pyruvate kinase activity by utilizing NAD rather than the more expensive NADP.
