Aerobic glycolysis (production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen) is a hallmark of cancer. Fenofibrate is a lipid-lowering drug and an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). We found that FF inhibited glycolysis in a PPARalpha-dependent manner in glioblastoma cells. Fenofibrate inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB/RelA and also disrupted its association with hypoxia inducible factor1 alpha (HIF1alpha), which is required for the binding of NF-kappaB/RelA to the PKM promoter and PKM2 expression. High ratios of PKM2/PKM1 promote glycolysis and inhibit oxidative phosphorylation, thus favoring aerobic glycolysis. Fenofibrate decreased the PKM2/PKM1 ratio and caused mitochondrial damage. Given that fenofibrate is a widely used non-toxic drug, we suggest its use in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
