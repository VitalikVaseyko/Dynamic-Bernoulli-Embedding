We surveyed the BALB/cHeA mouse, which lacks cytosolic glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction in the glycerol phosphate shuttle. The other enzyme of this shuttle, mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, is abundant in skeletal muscle and pancreatic islets suggesting that the shuttle's activity is high in these tissues. Levels of glycerol phosphate (low) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (high) were very abnormal in nonislet tissue, especially in skeletal muscle. Intermediates situated before the triose phosphates in the glycolysis pathway were increased and those after the triose phosphates were generally low, depending on the tissue. The lactate/pyruvate ratio in muscle was low signifying a low cytosolic NAD/NADH ratio. This suggests that a nonfunctional glycerol phosphate shuttle caused a block in glycolysis at the step catalyzed by glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. When exercised, mice were unable to maintain normal ATP levels in skeletal muscle. Blood glucose, serum insulin levels, and pancreatic islet mass were normal. In isolated pancreatic islets insulin release, glucose metabolism and ATP levels were normal, but lactate levels and lactate/pyruvate ratios with a glucose load were slightly abnormal. The BALB/cHeA mouse can maintain NAD/ NADH ratios sufficient to function normally under most conditions, but the redox state is not normal. Glycerol phosphate is apparently formed at a slow rate. Skeletal muscle is severely affected probably because it is dependent on the glycerol phosphate shuttle more than other tissues. It most likely utilizes glycerol phosphate rapidly and, due to the absence of glycerol kinase in muscle, is unable to rapidly form glycerol phosphate from glycerol. Glycerol kinase is also absent in the pancreatic insulin cell, but this cell's function is essentially normal probably because of redundancy of NAD(H) shuttles.
