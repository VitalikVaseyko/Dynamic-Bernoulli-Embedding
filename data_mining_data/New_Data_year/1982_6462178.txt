The influence of thyroxine on some of the key enzymes involved in glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways in the testes of pre-pubertal; pubertal and adult rats was studied. Thyroxine-induced (25 micrograms/100 g body weight) hyperthyroidism for 1 month resulted in no change in either hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) or 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) activity in the testes of rats in any age group studied. However, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) activity was reduced significantly in the pre-pubertal and pubertal rats. Both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.44) activities were markedly increased after thyroxine treatment. Withdrawal of hormone treatment resulted in reversion of enzyme activities towards normal. The results suggest that thyroxine has an age-dependent, specific effect over testicular pyruvate kinase activity. Thyroid hormone may have a direct control over the pentose phosphate pathway in the testis.
