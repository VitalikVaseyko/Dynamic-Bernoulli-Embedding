BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive malignancy, with a high incidence and poor prognosis. In the past several decades, hundreds of proteins have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of ESCC, but none has been widely accepted to guide clinical care. This study aimed to identify proteins with great potential for predicting prognosis of ESCC. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on immunohistochemical (IHC) prognostic markers of ESCC according to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines. Literature related to IHC prognostic markers of ESCC were searched from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until January 30th, 2017. The risk of bias of these original studies was evaluated using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. RESULTS: We identified 11 emerging IHC markers with reproducible results, including eight markers [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Survivin, Podoplanin, Fascin, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)] indicating unfavorable prognosis and 3 markers (P27, P16, and E-cadherin) indicating favorable prognosis of ESCC. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence supports that these 11 emerging IHC markers or their combinations may be useful in predicting prognosis and aiding personalized therapy decision-making for ESCC patients.
