Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. A direct radioassay for this enzyme using [14C]PEP as substrate has been developed. The product, [14C]pyruvate, can be separated from the substrate rapidly and easily by applying the mixture to a hydroxyapatite column, and eluting the [14C]pyruvate directly into a scintillation vial. The [14C]PEP is bound to the column which can be regenerated and used indefinitely. The assay is sensitive, rapid, and particularly well suited for the simultaneous assay of large numbers of samples.
