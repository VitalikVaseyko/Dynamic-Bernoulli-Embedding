The activities of several enzymes of glucose metabolism (glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid pathways) in four different regions of rat brain (cerebellum, medulla oblongata and pons, cerebral cortex and diencephalon) have been studied. Statistical differences were found in the activities of all the enzymes analyzed in the four regions, except in the case of the soluble hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. The changes observed in citrate synthase activity may account for physiological differences in those areas related to myelin formation and energy metabolism. Cerebral cortex and diencephalon showed enzyme activities which were generally greater than those of the cerebellum and medulla oblongata and pons. The results obtained lend support to the concept of a differential energy metabolism in brain regions.
