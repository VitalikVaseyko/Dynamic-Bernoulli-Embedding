Effects of TRH or its analog DN-1417 (gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-L-histidyl-L- prolinamide ) and pentobarbital, alone or in combination, on oxygen consumption and cyclic AMP formation in rat cerebral cortex slices were investigated. The oxygen consumption of rat cerebral cortex slices as measured with a Warburg apparatus, increased linearly over time (0 to 60-min incubation at 37C). Addition of pentobarbital (1 to 7 x 10-4M) inhibited oxygen consumption, in a concentration-dependent manner, up to 45% of control. A concomitant application of DN-1417 (10-5M) or TRH (10-4M) and pentobarbital (5 x 10-4M) led to a partial recovery of the pentobarbital effect. The similar anti-pentobarbital effects were observed with the addition of carbachol (10-4M) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10-3M), but not norepinephrine (10-4M) or dopamine (10-4M). DN-1417, TRH, carbachol, norepinephrine or dopamine at 10-4M stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the cerebral cortex slices. Addition of pentobarbital (1 to 7 x 10-4M) inhibited the cyclic AMP formation, in a concentration-dependent manner. DN-1417, TRH or carbachol at 10-4M but not norepinephrine or dopamine at 10-4M significantly reversed the reduction of cyclic AMP formation induced by pentobarbital (5 x 10-4M). Atropine (10-4M) almost completely abolished DN-1417-, TRH- and carbachol-induced cyclic AMP formation in the presence and absence of pentobarbital.
