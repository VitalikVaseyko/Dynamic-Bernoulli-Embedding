The present study aims to clarify the protective effect of supplementation with some antioxidants, such as idebenone (200 mg/kg, ip), melatonin (10 mg/kg, ip) and arginine (200 mg/kg, ip) and their combination, on liver function (T. protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase), energetic parameters (adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine monophosphate, inorganic phosphate, total adenylate, adenylate energy charge and potential phosphate). The effect on glycolytic and glycogenolytic enzymes (glucose, glycogen, glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase against hypoxia) was also studied. The drugs were administered 24 and 1 h prior sodium nitrite intoxication. All biochemical parameters were estimated 1 h after sodium nitrite injection. Injection of sodium nitrite (75 mg/kg, sc) produced a significant disturbance in all biochemical parameters of liver function, energetic parameters and glycolytic and glycogenolytic enzymes. Hepatic damage was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver as compared to controls. The marked changes in hepatic cells induced by sodium nitrite were completely abolished by pretreatment with the drug combination, suggesting potential protection against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia. It could be concluded that a combination of both idebenone and melatonin or idebenone and arginine provides potential protection against sodium nitrite-induced hypoxia by improving biochemical parameters and preserving liver histology.
