Autoantibody response to tumor antigens has been widely used to identify novel tumor markers for different cancers, including that of the head and neck. The oral cavity, which is in the head and neck region, comprises of many sub sites with distinct biologies and incidence of cancer of each sub site of the oral cavity is different. It is anticipated therefore that each sub site of the oral cavity may elicit a differential autoantibody response. This report evaluates the autoantibody response in 15 patients with cancer of gingivo-buccal complex and in 15 patients with cancer of tongue using Immunoproteomics, and shows that the autoantibody response to alpha-enolase, HSP 70, peroxiredoxin-VI, annexin II, pyruvate kinase, alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin, ATP synthase, triose phosphate isomerase and aldose reductase seen in patients with cancer of gingivo-buccal complex is absent in patients with cancer of tongue. This suggests that cancer of these sub sites should be studied separately because of their different biology and emerging site specific molecular signatures including autoantibody responses to ensure unambiguous clinical interpretations.
