Some aspects of carbohydrate metabolism were investigated in three non-malignant, glycogen storing, cell lines derived from a primary culture of rat hepatocytes, and in the Morris hepatoma 3924 cells. The three cell lines show biochemical alterations which are, to a large extent, similar to those found in the hepatoma cells: increased activity of glycolytic enzymes and decreased activity of gluconeogenetic enzymes. An increase of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity is also found. The three cell lines, as the Morris hepatoma cells, actively convert glucose into lactate under the in vitro conditions of culture. Fructose is not taken up as quickly as glucose and galactose is not metabolized. As compared with normal hepatocytes, the three cell lines have altered metabolism and growth behaviour. They largely resemble the preneoplastic cells appearing in rat liver at the early stages of experimental carcinogenesis.
