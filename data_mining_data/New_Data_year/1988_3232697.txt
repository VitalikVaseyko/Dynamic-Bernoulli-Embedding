The serum activity of creatine kinase (CK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) was measured in 98 pairs of same-sex Brazilian twins. The purpose of this study was to estimate the genetic and environmental components of serum activity levels for both enzymes. Heritabilities were estimated separately by path analysis in each sex. The results showed that CK and PK activities are under genetic control in normal males and females. Environmental components were not statistically significant for CK or PK. The genetic component of both enzymes estimated in females has implications in the calculation of genetic risks for Duchenne muscular dystrophy carriers.
