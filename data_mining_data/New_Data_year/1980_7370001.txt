The extent of binding of glycolytic enzymes to the particulate fraction of homogenates was measured in bovine psoas muscle before and after electrical stimulation. In association with an accelerated glycolytic rate on stimulation, there was a significant increase in the binding of certain glycolytic enzymes, the most notable of which were phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. From the known association of glycolytic enzymes with the I-band of muscle it is proposed that electrical stimulation of anaerobic muscle increases enzyme binding to actin filaments. Calculations of the extent of enzyme binding suggest that significant amounts of enzyme protein, particularly aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, are associated with the actin filaments. The results also imply that kinetic parameters derived from considerations of the enzyme activity in the soluble state may not have direct application to the situation in the muscle fibre, particularly during accelerated glycolysis.
