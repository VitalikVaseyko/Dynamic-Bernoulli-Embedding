1. A substantial increase of the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed after preincubation of bovine heart submitochondrial particles with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. 2. The activation was accompanied by an increase of Vmax, without change of Km for ATP. 3. The activated particles catalysed the biphasic hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system; the initial rapid phase was followed by a second, slower, phase in a time-dependent fashion. 4. The higher the ATP concentration used as a substrate, the higher is the rate of transition between these two phases. 5. The particles catalysed the hydrolysis of ITP with a lag phase; after preincubation with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase, ITP was hydrolysed at a constant rate. 6. Qualitatively the same phenomena were observed when soluble mitochondrial ATPase (F1-ATPase) prepared by the conventional method in the presence of ATP was used as nucleotide triphosphatase. 7. A kinetic scheme is proposed, in which the intermediate active enzyme-product complex (E.ADP) formed during ATP hydrolysis is in slow equilibrium with the inactive E*.ADP complex forming as a result of dislocation of ADP from the active site of ATPase to the other site, which is not in rapid equilibrium with the surrounding medium.
