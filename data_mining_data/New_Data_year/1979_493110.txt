Blood donors from the Centre Regional de Transfusion Sanguine de Rennes were investigated for the phenotypic distribution of seven enzymatic systems : adenylate kinase, adenosine deaminase, esterase D, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, phosphoglucomutase, and glyoxalase I. Two unusual phenotypes were observed: phenotype 6-1 for adenosine deaminase and phenotype 3-1 for transaminase GPT. For five of these enzymes, the statistical analysis points out significant differences in one or several of the European populations described in the literature.
