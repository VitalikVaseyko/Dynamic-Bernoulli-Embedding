Two patients with non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia were found to have elevated red blood cell pyruvate kinase activities commensurate with the decreased mean red cell age, but the residual pyruvate kinase had marked kinetic abnormalities. Accumulation of metabolic intermediates before pyruvate kinase and reduced levels of activity of the red blood cells of the parents of both patients supported the diagnosis of an inherited abnormal pyruvate kinase causing hemolytic anemia. Although it was observed in two unrelated persons, review of enzyme assays performed on the red blood cells of 651 patients with hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia suggests that this occurrence is rare.
