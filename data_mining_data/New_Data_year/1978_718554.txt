We have carried out a survey to determine the prevalence of carriers of pyruvate kinase deficiency haemolytic anaemia in Basenjis in Victoria. Of 186 dogs tested, 20 were found to be carriers for pyruvate kinase deficiency, a prevalence similar to that reported overseas. Of the 20 carriers found, 17 were born in Australia and were traced directly to 1 of the 3 imported carriers. Despite the relatively high frequency of carriers, no mating of 2 carriers has yet been detected and no dogs with haemolytic anaemia have been observed. The inheritance of the pyruvate kinase deficiency has been traced through up to 5 generations of dogs in Australia and is consistent with co-dominance for pyruvate kinase activity and with an autosomal recessive gene for haemolytic anemia.
