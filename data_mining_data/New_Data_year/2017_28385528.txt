Despite numerous studies that report the glucose derived glycoconjugates as antitumor candidates, using mannose as sugar motif for specific tumor targeting remains less studied. In this research, two novel mannose-conjugated platinum complexes 4a and 4b that target the Warburg effect were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. Compared with oxaliplatin, both complexes exhibited substantial enhancement in water solubility as well as excellent or comparative cytotoxicity in six human cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity assessments on Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) down-regulated or overexpressed cells and platinum accumulation study demonstrated that cellular uptake of compound 4a was regulated by GLUT1. In particular, 4a induced apoptosis in HT29 cells by suppressing expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which preliminary explained the mechanism origin of antitumor effect. As indicated by its maximum tolerated dose-finding assay and in vivo anticancer activity, compound 4a exhibits better safety and efficacy profile than oxaliplatin. The findings of this study indicate the possibility of subjecting mannose-conjugated platinum complexes as lead compounds for further preclinical evaluation.
