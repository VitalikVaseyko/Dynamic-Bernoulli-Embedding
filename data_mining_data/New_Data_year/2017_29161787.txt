OBJECTIVE: Curing cancer by controlling the growth of the cancer cell is the objective of this paper. The growth of the cancer cell is analysed by the optimization programming. The algorithm is proposed for minimizing the rate of growth of the cancer cell. Hence the chaotic cancer became structured for the further research. This is an extended work of Warburg [1], where he defined the centre of the cancer cell, known by Warburg effect, but here we control the increasing radius of the cancer circle by the proposed Cancer Control Algorithm.
