Red cell GSH, GSH regeneration rates, and the activities of ten enzymes were measured in the red blood cells of camels and buffaloes. The activity of G6PD was found to be much higher in both the species compared to that found in other ruminants such as sheep, goats, and cattle. Although there were no significant differences in the level of red cell GSH in the two species, there was a striking differences in the rate of GSH regeneration, the mean rate of 0.162 +/- 0.009 mumoles/min/gHb in the camels was significantly higher than the 0.082 +/- 0.011 mumoles/min/gHb observed in the buffaloes.
