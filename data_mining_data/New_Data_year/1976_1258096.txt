The activities of six intra-erythrocytic enzymes--glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, triosephosphate-isomerase and phosphoglucomutase--have been measured in euthyroid probands (n=18) and in hyperthyroid patients (n=13) prior to radioiodine therapy and after stabilization of the metabolic conditions. The hexokinase, triosephosphate-isomerase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase did not show any significant changes. A moderate diminution of the aldolase activity and a distinct decrease of the phosphoglucomutase activity occur during hyperthyroidism. After normalization of the metabolic conditions, both the enzymatic activities increase again.
