This communication reports biochemical findings in 7 patients with anterior horn cell disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by evidence of denervation in the EMG and mukle biopsy with normal motor conduction velocities. In 4 of these patients, upper extremities were involved in a symmetrical fashion. In 1, the upper and lower extremities were involved in a symmetrical fashion. In the other 2, one upper or lower extremity were respectively involved in isolation. Pyramidal tract signs were evident in 2 patients of this group. Seventh cranial nerve and 12th cranial nerve involvement were seen in 2 patients. None of the patients manifested 8th cranial nerve dysfunction. All of these 7 patients showed elevation of raised fasting plasma lactate, with normal plasma citrate and plasma pyruvate values. This is in contrast to the altered citrate and pyruvate levels described by other workers in other cases of anterior horn cell disease. The significant biochemical relationship are discussed.
