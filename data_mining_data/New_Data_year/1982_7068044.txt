Enzymes activities in homogenates of the large intestine were measured in biopsies from 11 tubular adenomas and six carcinomas and from the corresponding normal mucosa of each individual. A similar and significant increase was found in the total activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase in adenomas and carcinomas as compared with the levels of normal mucosa. The lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme patterns showed also a marked and similar change in the adenomas and carcinomas with a significant increase of lactate dehydrogenase M-monomers. Most of the adenomas showed slight to moderate dysplasia. The results indicate that the measurement of total G 6 PD, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities for screening purposes has no predictive value in separating non-premalignant from premalignant adenomas. Moreover, it seems that the enzymatic characteristics of malignancy are present even in tubular adenomas. This is in agreement with the theory of a polyp-cancer sequence.
