The gene for the thermostable pyruvate kinase of Microbispora thermodiastatica IFO 14046, a moderate thermophilic actinomycete, was cloned in Escherichia coli. This gene consists of an open reading frame of 1422 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 474 amino acids with molecular mass of 50,805 Da. The open reading frame was confirmed as the pyruvate kinase gene by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified pyruvate kinase from M. thermodiastatica.
