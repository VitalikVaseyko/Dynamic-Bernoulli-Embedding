We studied the effect of spontaneous long-term (9-10 months) diabetes on the heart of Chinese hamsters (CHAD strain) to elucidate the relationship between diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. The diabetic hamsters, aged approximately 11 months, showed body weight loss, hyperglycemia (mean fasting plasma glucose 402 mg/dl), hypoinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and ketonemia. The diabetic hamsters showed reduced activities of cytoplasmic glycolytic key enzymes; hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase, increases in cardiac glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate contents and a 40% decrease in cardiac ATP content, indicating decreased energy production. An accumulation of myocardial triglyceride and cholesterol was found in the diabetic hamsters. In addition, the cardiac norepinephrine content was increased in the diabetic hamsters, suggesting the presence of autonomic nervous disorder. Increased heart weight and thickening of the septum and both ventricular walls were found in the diabetic hamsters. Light-microscopic analysis revealed that 42.9% of the diabetic hamsters had myocardial degeneration without any vascular lesion of extramural large and intramural small vessels, whereas the non-diabetic controls had no myocardial or vascular lesions. These data suggest that the diabetic Chinese hamsters had cardiomyopathy, which is possibly caused by extravascular factors such as metabolic or autonomic nervous disorder although conclusive evidence is lacking.
