Key enzyme activities of carbohydrate metabolism were evaluated as sensitive indicators of liver cell injury of rats. Hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase distribution in the acinus of the liver was also studied histochemically with the following results: The activities of liver-specific enzymes, such as glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1.6-diphosphatase, glucokinase and pyruvate kinase Type L, were decreased. While the activities of nonspecific enzymes to liver, such as hexokinase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase Type M2 were increased. The decrease in glucokinase activity was marked and was found as early as one day after bile duct ligation. Isozymes of HK, I, II and III, all increased to the same extents. Increased hexokinase activity was found in the centrolobular area, where the decreased activity of glucose 6-phosphatase was observed. These changes in the key enzyme activities indicated the presence of a hepatocyte injury caused by bile duct ligation.
