Red blood cell membrane proteins were studied in a group of patients with hereditary spherocytosis, in comparison with normal donors, to reveal anomalous proteins associated with this disease. For this purpose red blood cells of the patients and normal donors were fractionated, by the age, in Ficoll-400 gradient, as a result red blood cell membranes were obtained with proteins that were investigated by the method of two-dimensional electrophoresis. In comparison of two-dimensional electrophoregrams of red blood cell membrane proteins of normal donors and those of microspherocytosis patients it was found that the latters had additional peptides in the area of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate hydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. The changes detected in the red blood cell membrane protein composition might be caused by age shifts in the red blood cell population or by the disease type.
