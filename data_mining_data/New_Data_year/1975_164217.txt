The kinetics of glycerol uptake by the perfused rat liver were determined according to a model which includes membrane transport, intracellular phosphorylation and competitive inhibition of glycerol phosphorylation by L-glycerol 3-phosphate. The membrane transport obeys first-order kinetics at concentrations below 10 mM in the affluent medium. The K-m of the glycerol phosphorylation was 10 muM and the K-i of the L-glycerol 3-phosphate inhibition was 50 muM. The maximum activity (V) was 3.70 mumoles/min per g liver wet wt. These results are similar to in vitro kinetics of the glycerol kinase, except that K-i was found to be somewhat lower in the intact organ. At low glycerol concentrations, a steep concentration gradient exists across the liver cell membrane. The increase in the lactate to pyruvate concentration ratio during glycerol metabolism is related to the actual concentration of L-glycerol 3-phosphate, not to the rate of glycerol uptake.
