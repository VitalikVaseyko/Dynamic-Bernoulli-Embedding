Sparse-fur (spf) mutant mice with X-linked ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency were used to study the effect of L-carnitine on energy metabolites in congenital hyperammonemia. L-Carnitine was used at doses of 2, 4, 8, or 16 mmol/kg body weight (BW), and levels of ammonia, glutamine, glutamate, and some intermediates of energy metabolism were measured in brain and liver of spf/Y mice. Cerebral and hepatic levels of ammonia were decreased with 4 mmol L-carnitine (P < .001), whereas other doses did not seem to have any effect on this metabolite. Cerebral levels of glutamine were decreased following administration of L-carnitine at doses of up to 4 mmol/kg BW, whereas hepatic glutamine levels remained unaltered at all doses of L-carnitine. Both cerebral and hepatic levels of pyruvate, lactate, and alpha-ketoglutarate were decreased at doses of up to 8 mmol L-carnitine/kg BW. L-Carnitine treatment elevated adenosine triphosphate (ATP), free coenzyme A (CoA), and acetyl CoA levels in both brain and liver of spf/Y mice. Cytosolic and mitochondrial redox ratios of spf/Y mice, which were altered by congenital chronic hyperammonemia, were partially corrected by L-carnitine administration. L-Carnitine supplementation to spf/Y mice during sodium benzoate therapy also restored the availability of free CoA and ATP, thus counteracting the adverse effects of higher doses of sodium benzoate. These changes in free CoA and acetyl CoA levels could be due to the deinhibition of pantothenate kinase and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation by L-carnitine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
