Serotonergic neuronal networks are important for food intake and body weight regulation. Dexfenfluramine (dF), a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, was used to investigate changes in food intake, body weight development, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, and substrate oxidation rates for 12 days. Rats, which had been made obese by early postnatal overfeeding, received an energy-controlled mash diet and water ad lib and were intraperitoneally injected daily with either saline, 5 or 10 mg dF/kg. Compared to controls, food intake, body weight development, and energy expenditure were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, especially during the first 6 days. Lipid oxidation was increased while oxidation of carbohydrates was decreased. Pair-feeding experiments over 2 days revealed that this was not solely a result of diminished food intake but also an additional metabolic effect of dF, different from its anorectic effect. At the end of these experiments, plasma glucose and liver glycogen were unchanged after dF, but plasma free fatty acids were significantly decreased. Insulin-sensitivity was probably improved, indicated by decreased insulin levels and increases in muscle glycogen contents and activities of muscle pyruvate kinase. Liver-glutamine and contents of valine, leucine, and isoleucine in the muscle were significantly decreased after dF-treatment, the latter indicating a diminished proteolysis. The plasma tryptophan/large neutral amino acids ratio of the dF-rats was unchanged but that of the paired-fed rats was changed, despite similar changes in food intake. It is concluded that both increased oxidation of endogenous fat and reduced food intake could mediate the body weight reducing effect of dF.
