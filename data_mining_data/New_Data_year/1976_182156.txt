1. Procedures were developed for the extraction and assay of glycolytic enzymes from the epididymis and epididymal spermatozoa of the rat. 2. The epididymis was separated into four segments for analysis. When rendered free of spermatozoa by efferent duct ligation, regional differences in enzyme activity were apparent. Phosphofructokinase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were more active in the proximal regions of the epididymis, whereas hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase and phosphorylase were more active in the distal segment. These enzymes were less active in the epididymis of castrated animals and less difference was apparent between the proximal and distal segments. However, the corpus epididymidis from castrated rats had lower activities of almost all enzymes compared with other epididymal segments. 3. Spermatozoa required sonication to obtain satisfactory enzyme release. Glycolytic enzymes were more active in spermatozoa than in epididymal tissue, being more than 10 times as active in the case of hexokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase and phosphoglycerate mutase. 4. The specific activities of a number of enzymes in the epididymis were dependent on the androgen status of the animal. These included hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and phosphorylase. 5. The caput and cauda epididymidis differed in the extent to which enzyme activities changed in response to an altered androgen status. The most notable examples were hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and phosphorylase.
