Most cancers rely disproportionately on glycolysis for energy even in the presence of adequate oxygen supply, a condition known as "aerobic glycolysis", or the "Warburg effect". Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1a subunit (PDHA1) is one of main factors for metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis and has been suggested to be closely associated with tumorigenesis. Here we observed that PDHA1 protein was reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens by immunohistochemistry and western blot, which was significantly associated with poor overall survival. To further analyze the function of PDHA1 in cancer cells, it was up-regulated in HCC cell line SMMC-7721 and HepG2. The results demonstrated that overexpression of PDHA1 gene inhibited aerobic glycolysis with lower lactate via increased PDH activity, meanwhile mitochondrial OXPHOS was enhanced accompanied with higher ATP and lower glucose consumption. We also found that apoptosis was promoted and intrinsic pathway proteins was increased in PDHA1 overexpressing cells. Collectively, our data indicate that reduced PDHA1 protein expression is associated with poor clinical outcome HCC cancers. Up-regulated PDHA1 gene expression can inhibit Warburg effect and enhanced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.
