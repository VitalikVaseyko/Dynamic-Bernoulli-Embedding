Three novel splice site mutations and two novel missense mutations were identified by molecular analysis of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency associated with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. A Nepalese PK variant, PK Kowloon, was found to have a homozygous transversion at the 5'-splice site of the seventh intervening sequence (IVS) of the L-type PK gene (Ivs7[+1]gt --> tt). Using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we showed that the R-type PK mRNA in the proband's reticulocytes included the seventh IVS between the seventh and eighth exon, introducing a stop codon 3 nucleotides downstream of the mutated site. Consequently, the translational product may lack 44% of the R-PK polypeptide. A transition at the last nucleotide of exon 9 (1269GCG --> GCA) was found in a Japanese PK variant, PK 'Kamata.' The mutation did not alter the amino acid sequence, but caused skipping of the ninth exonic sequence in the R-PK transcripts. As a result, the affected R-type PK lost 51 amino acid residues (373Met-423Ala del). A transversion at the splice acceptor site of the third IVS (Ivs 3[-2]ag --> tg) was identified in PK 'Aomori.' The mutation resulted in aberrant splicing at a cryptic splice site within exon 4, causing deletion of two codons in the aberrant R-PK transcript (95 Gly-96 Pro --> del). Both PK 'Kamata' and PK 'Aomori' had a missense mutation on the other allele, 1044AAG --> AAT (348Lys --> Asn) and 1075CGC --> TGC (359Arg --> Cys), respectively. Although both 348Lys and 359Arg were located in the sixth loop of A domain (beta/alpha)8 barrel, which has been shown to contain the substrate and cation binding sites, the degree of anemia was much more severe in PK 'Kamata' than PK 'Aomori,' possibly because the 51 amino acid deletion of PK 'Kamata' but the 2 amino-acid deletion of PK 'Aomori' may abolish PK catalytic activity.
