Human phosphoglycerate kinase has been totally purified from leukemic granulocytes by double 'affinity elution' with ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. This purification procedure allowed to obtain 19 mg of protein, specific activity of which was 400 IU/mg i.e. a 105-fold purification and an overall yield of 47%. Purified enzyme was homogenous when tested by acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. Specific antibodies raised in rabbits totally inactivated phosphoglycerate kinase of crude extracts as well as of the purified preparation. The molecular specific activity (i.e. the ratio enzyme activity/immunological reactivity) was identical in leukocytes, platelets, erythrocytes and was identical in these cells to the value found for the totally purified phosphoglycerate kinase.
