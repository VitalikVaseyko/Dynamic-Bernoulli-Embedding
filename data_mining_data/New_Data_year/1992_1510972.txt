The stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by the EcoRV restriction endonuclease has been determined. This endonuclease recognizes GATATC sequence and cuts between the central T and dA bases. The Rp isomer of d(GACGATsATCGTC) (this dodecamer contains a phosphorothioate rather than the usual phosphate group between the central T and dA residues, indicated by the s) was a substrate for the endonuclease. Performing this reaction in H2 18O gave [18O]dps(ATCGTC) (a pentamer containing an 18O-labeled 5'-phosphorothioate) which was converted to [18O]dAMPS with nuclease P1. This deoxynucleoside 5'-[18O]phosphorothioate was stereospecifically converted to [18O]dATP alpha S with adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase [Brody, R. S., & Frey, P. A. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 1245-1251]. Analysis of the position of the 18O in this product by 31P NMR spectroscopy showed that it was in a bridging position between the alpha- and beta-phosphorus atoms. This indicates that the EcoRV hydrolysis proceeds with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. The simplest interpretation is that the mechanism of this endonuclease involves a direct in-line attack at phosphorus by H2O with a trigonal bipyramidal transition state. A covalent enzyme oligodeoxynucleotide species can be discounted as an intermediate. An identical result has been previously observed with the EcoR1 endonuclease [Connolly, B. A., Eckstein, F., & Pingoud, A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10760-10763]. X-ray crystallography has shown that both of these endonucleases contain a conserved array of amino acids at their active sites. Possible mechanistic roles for these conserved amino acids in the light of the stereochemical findings are discussed.
