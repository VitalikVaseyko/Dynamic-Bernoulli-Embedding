Plastidic pyruvate kinase (PK(p)) from Brassica napus suspension cells was purified 431-fold to a final specific activity of 28 micromol phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) utilized/min/mg protein. SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and gel filtration analyses indicated that this PK(p) exists as a 380-kDa heterohexamer composed of equal proportions of 64- (alpha-subunit) and 58-kDa (beta-subunit) polypeptides. The N-terminal sequence of the PK(p) alpha- and beta-subunits exhibited maximal identity with the corresponding regions deduced from putative PK genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Methylobacterium extorquens, respectively. B. napus PK(p) displayed a sharp pH optimum of pH 8.0, and hyperbolic saturation kinetics with PEP and ADP (K(m) = 0.052 and 0.14 mM, respectively). 6-Phosphogluconate functioned as an activator (K(a) = 0.12 mM) by increasing V(max) by approximately 35% while decreasing the K(m)(PEP) and K(m)(ADP) values by 40 and 50%, respectively. 2-Oxoglutarate and oxalate were the most effective inhibitors (I(50) = 8.3 and 0.23 mM, respectively). A model is presented which highlights the role of 6-phosphogluconate in coordinating stromal NADPH and ATP production for anabolic processes of B. napus leucoplasts.
