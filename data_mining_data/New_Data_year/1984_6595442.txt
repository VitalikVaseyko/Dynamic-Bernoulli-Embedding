The histologic classification of mouse liver tumors, i.e., hepatic nodules type 1 and type 2 and hepatocellular carcinomas, was evaluated by a comparison of several biologic and biochemical markers that have been shown to be useful for the grading of tumor malignancy. The liver tumors were induced by N,N'-2,7-fluorenylenebisacetamide (CAS: 304-28-9; N,N'-fluoren-2,7-ylenebisacetamide) administration to male CD-1 mice. The ability to induce L-type pyruvate kinase activity in response to a high-carbohydrate diet disappeared in almost all the liver tumors. However, fairly good correlations were observed between the histologic classification and the relative weights of liver and intraperitoneal fat pads, between the histologic classification and the level of serum total cholesterol, and between the histologic classification and the K-type pyruvate kinase activity. The results suggest that the present histologic classification reflects the degree of tumor malignancy, and therefore, it would be useful for the classification of mouse liver tumors.
