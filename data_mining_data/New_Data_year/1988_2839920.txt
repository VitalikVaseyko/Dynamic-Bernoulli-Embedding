The intraperitoneal administration of corticotropin (ACTH) in the rate of 1 and 2 units per 100 g of body weight and that of hydrocortisone in the rate of 1 mg and 5 mg per 100 g body weight were studied for their effects on carbohydrate metabolism rate in musculus gastrocnemius as well as on the level of 11-oxycorticosteroids in blood plasma of rats. The glycogen level in muscles was found to rise 3 hours after ACTH and hydrocortisone administration and it correlated with the hydrocortisone level increase in blood plasma (r = 0.714 and 0.863, respectively); the activity of pyruvate kinase decreased. Simultaneously ACTH did not change while hydrocortisone lowered the phosphorylase activity and the content of both fructose-6-phosphate and lactate.
