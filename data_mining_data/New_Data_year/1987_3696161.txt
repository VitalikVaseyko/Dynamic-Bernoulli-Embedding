Cytoplasmic beta-actin and five glycolytic enzyme cDNAs were isolated from a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library and together with a genomic clone of rat cytochrome c were used as probes to quantitate the respective RNA transcription rates in isolated nuclei run off transcription assays from stationary cells cultured under normal or 2% oxygen. The transcription rates of lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase and aldolase increased by 2-5 fold during the 72 hr exposure to 2% oxygen. There was a small increase in actin RNA transcription while both cytochrome c and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA transcription rates decreased. Since previous studies demonstrated an increase in steady state glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA during low O2 exposure it is concluded that the level of this RNA is regulated post transcriptionally whereas the other four glycolytic enzyme RNAs are regulated at least partially at the level of transcription by oxygen availability. The relative transcriptional rates of the RNAs in this study are related to their cellular RNA and protein concentrations.
