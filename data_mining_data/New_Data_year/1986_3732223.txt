The effect of NH4+ on M2-pyruvate kinase isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was investigated. The enzyme is activated by NH4+ more efficiently than by K+. Moreover, a synergistic interaction of the two cations is observed since NH4+ increases the affinity of the enzyme for K+. The affinity of the enzyme for phosphoenolpyruvate is also increased in the presence of NH4+, and in these conditions the activating effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is reduced. It is proposed that NH4+ be considered a specific allosteric activator of the tumor enzyme.
