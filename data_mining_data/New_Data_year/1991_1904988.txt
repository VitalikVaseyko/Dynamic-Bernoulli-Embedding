A rapid switch from a fermentative to a primarily oxidative type of glucose utilization was observed during in vitro differentiation of Trypanosoma brucei STIB348 and EATRO1244 bloodstream to procyclic trypomastigotes. In accordance with previously published reports bloodstream populations produced pyruvate as the major end product of glucose catabolism, together with very small amounts of CO2, succinate and glycerol. During differentiation pyruvate excretion decreased within 48 h to the low levels produced by 28-day procyclic stages. Concomitant with the decline in pyruvate formation, acetate appeared as a new product and the rates of respiratory CO2 increased considerably. The amount of carbon released with these compounds could account for nearly all of the glucose carbon consumed. Rates of glucose utilization and formation of acetate and CO2 in cells differentiated for 48 h were essentially the same as those found in 28-day procyclics. Succinate and glycerol excretion remained low during the entire transformation process, and no significant difference in the pattern and quantities of end products were found between the two trypanosome strains. During trypanosome differentiation the changes in metabolism were associated with marked alterations in enzyme activity levels. Activities of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD+), succinate dehydrogenase and fumarase were not detectable in bloodstream trypomastigotes but appeared upon differentiation for 24 h. An exception was citrate synthase whose activity was not demonstrable until 48 h postinoculation into culture. After 48 h the majority of the TCA cycle enzyme activities continued to increase steadily until day 28. Pyruvate kinase activity decreased in differentiating cells after 48 h to about 25% of the level found in bloodstream trypomastigotes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
