The ATP level and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity were measured in red cells of 21 dogs. The obtained results are: ATP -- 732 +/- 197.3 mumoles/1 RBC, PK -- 919 +/- 452.3 mumoles/min/1 RBC. The ATP level in dog red cells was significantly lower than in rabbit and rat red cells (p less than 0.05). Possible explanation for the low ATP level in dog red cells is discussed.
