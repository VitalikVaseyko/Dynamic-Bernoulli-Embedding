A knowledge-based information system has been constructed to facilitate and standardize the interpretation of data obtained from specialized analyses in clinical chemistry. For illustration the system was applied to metabolic studies of erythrocytes from patients in whom hereditary disorders are suspected to explain the presence of a haemolytic anaemia or a polycythaemia. The study includes assay of the catalytic activity of 10 different enzymes and the concentration of some key metabolites. The knowledge-based system is an excellent tool for documentation, updating and transfer of knowledge of the interpretative process. This will reduce the risk of changes in this process being made without sound motivation and documentation. Furthermore, the statistical and graphic features of the system provide data for long-term quality assessment and insights into reference sample groups which are used to update decision levels.
