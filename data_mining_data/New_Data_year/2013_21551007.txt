In this study, we compared the effects of endurance training in the fasted state (F) vs. the fed state [ample carbohydrate intake (CHO)] on exercise-induced intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and glycogen utilization during a 6-wk period of a hypercaloric ( approximately +30% kcal/day) fat-rich diet (HFD; 50% of kcal). Healthy male volunteers (18-25 yrs) received a HFD in conjunction with endurance training (four times, 60-90 min/wk) either in F (n = 10) or with CHO before and during exercise sessions (n = 10). The control group (n = 7) received a HFD without training and increased body weight by approximately 3 kg (P < 0.001). Before and after a HFD, the subjects performed a 2-h constant-load bicycle exercise test in F at approximately 70% maximal oxygen uptake rate. A HFD, both in the absence (F) or presence (CHO) of training, elevated basal IMCL content by approximately 50% in type I and by approximately 75% in type IIa fibers (P < 0.05). Independent of training in F or CHO, a HFD, as such, stimulated exercise-induced net IMCL breakdown by approximately twofold in type I and by approximately fourfold in type IIa fibers. Furthermore, exercise-induced net muscle glycogen breakdown was not significantly affected by a HFD. It is concluded that a HFD stimulates net IMCL degradation by increasing basal IMCL content during exercise in type I and especially IIa fibers. Furthermore, a hypercaloric HFD provides adequate amounts of carbohydrates to maintain high muscle glycogen content during training and does not impair exercise-induced muscle glycogen breakdown.
