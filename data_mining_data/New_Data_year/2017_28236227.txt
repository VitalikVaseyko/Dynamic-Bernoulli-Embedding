PURPOSE: A hallmark of cancer is metabolic reprogramming, which is exploited by cancer cells to ensure rapid growth and survival. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, a key step in tumor metabolism and growth. Recently, we reported the radiosynthesis of the first positron emission tomography tracer for visualizing PKM2 in vivo-i.e., [(11)C]DASA-23. Due to the highly promising imaging results obtained with [(11)C]DASA-23 in rodent model glioblastoma, we set out to generate an F-18-labeled version of this tracer, with the end goal of clinical translation in mind. Herein, we report the radiosynthesis of 1-((2-fluoro-6-[(18)F]fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperaz ine ([(18)F]DASA-23) and our initial investigation of its binding properties in cancer cells. PROCEDURE: We synthesized [(18)F]DASA-23 via fluorination of 1-((2-fluoro-6-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine (10) with K[(18)F]F/K2.2.2 in N,N-dimethylformamide at 110 degrees C for 20 min. Subsequently, we evaluated uptake of [(18)F]DASA-23 in HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells and in vitro stability in human and mouse serum. RESULTS: We successfully prepared [(18)F]DASA-23 in 2.61 +/- 1.54 % radiochemical yield (n = 10, non-decay corrected at end of synthesis) with a specific activity of 2.59 +/- 0.44 Ci/mumol. Preliminary cell uptake experiments revealed high uptake in HeLa cells, which was effectively blocked by pretreating cells with the structurally distinct PKM2 activator, TEPP-46. [(18)F]DASA-23 remained intact in human and mouse serum up to 120 min. CONCLUSION: Herein, we have identified a F-18-labeled PKM2 specific radiotracer which shows potential for in vivo imaging. The promising cell uptake results reported herein warrant the further evaluation of [(18)F]DASA-23 for its ability to detect and monitor cancer noninvasively.
