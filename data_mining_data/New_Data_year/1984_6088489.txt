Using a cDNA probe complementary to rat L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs, we studied the respective roles of glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, glucagon, and insulin in the induction of specific mRNAs in the liver of animals refed either a maltose-rich or a fructose-rich diet. Neither adrenalectomized nor thyroidectomized nor diabetic animals could express L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs in their liver when refed the carbohydrate-rich diets. When the animals were given the missing hormone, the level of hybridizable mRNAs returned to normal values but administration of the hormone alone failed to induce mRNA synthesis in fasted animals. Both glucagon and cyclic AMP abolished the induction of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs in refed animals. Exogenous insulin, whatever the dose, could not reverse the inhibitory action of glucagon. Insulin has usually been regarded as the main regulator of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression. It appears now that glucagon, beside regulating the enzyme activity by phosphorylation mechanisms, may also modulate L-type pyruvate kinase synthesis at a pre-translational level. Consequently, our results show that three conditions are required for the synthesis of liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs: (i) the presence of dietary carbohydrates, (ii) the cessation of glucagon release, and (iii) the presence of permissive hormones, including insulin.
