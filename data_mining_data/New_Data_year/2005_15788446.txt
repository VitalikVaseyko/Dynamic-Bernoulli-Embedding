The role of hepatic nitric oxide (NO) in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) was studied in animals carrying a nitric oxide synthase-2 transgene under the control of the phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase promoter. These mice expressed NOS-2 in liver cells under fasting conditions. Liver mass recovery and molecular parameters related to cell proliferation were determined after PH. Preexisting hepatic NO synthesis, as well as NO delivery by NO-donors, impaired early signaling (for example, attenuated NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha and IL-6 release). The regenerative process was also impaired as a result of an insufficient proliferative response, but mouse survival after surgery was not compromised. However, NO exerted a protective role against apoptosis in transgenic hepatectomized mice. Local production of NO in liver cells, achieved by hydrodynamic-based transfection with a NOS-2-encoding plasmid, also resulted in delayed liver recovery after PH and also protected against Fas-mediated apoptosis. These data show that sustained presence of NO after PH exerts a dual role: attenuating liver regeneration while efficiently protecting against liver apoptosis.
