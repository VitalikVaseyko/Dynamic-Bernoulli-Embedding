Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient red blood cells (RBCs) are known to be more susceptible to oxidant-induced hemolysis. Erythrocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals are significantly more susceptible to Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation than normal control cells. The enhanced susceptibility of G6PD-deficient RBCs to Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation is not due to ATP depletion. The remnant G6PD-deficient RBCs following vesiculation are more sensitive to complement-mediated hemolysis than control normal RBCs. A strong positive correlation exists between the level of Ca(2+)-induced vesiculation and the extent of complement mediated hemolysis.
