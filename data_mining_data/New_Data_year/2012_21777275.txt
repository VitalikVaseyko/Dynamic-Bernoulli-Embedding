The diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of disease activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require investigating clinical, radiological, and histological criteria, as well as serum inflammatory markers. However, a range of fecal inflammatory markers now appears to have the potential to greatly assist in these processes. Calprotectin, a prominent neutrophil protein, was identified two decades ago as a potentially revolutionary marker for IBD. Following this discovery, numerous additional markers, including S100A12, lactoferrin, and M2-pyruvate kinase, have also been suggested as novel markers of IBD. In the present study, we provide an up-to-date review of fecal markers of IBD, and further, provide a novel analysis of each of these fecal markers in severe ulcerative colitis and compare their expression pattern in contrast to calprotectin.
