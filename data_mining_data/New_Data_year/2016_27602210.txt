Synthesis and storage of the thyroid hormone precursor, thyroglobulin (TG), occurs within the follicular lumen of the thyroid and the TG is then absorbed into cells for further processing before release into the blood. However, the mechanism of energy metabolism in the follicular lumen of the thyroid remains unknown. In the present study, the three dimensional structure of thyroid follicles was constructed using a primary culture of swine cells and the follicular protein was identified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Three glycolysis-associated enzymes, enolase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase were identified in addition to TG. These results support the hypothesis that anaerobic glycolysis of glucose exists in the follicle and supports energy consumption for hormone synthesis.
