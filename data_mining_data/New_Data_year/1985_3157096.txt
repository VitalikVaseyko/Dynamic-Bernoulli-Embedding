The sequential changes in several glycolytic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycolytic intermediates, and adenosine triphosphate, as well as intracellular pH and plasma inorganic phosphorus were followed simultaneously in eight lambs from birth to 2 months of age. The activities of all glycolytic enzymes and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were elevated at birth. The 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration increased markedly postnatally and was associated with a simultaneous increase in the concentrations of red cell glucose-6-phosphate and total triose phosphate and a decrease in intracellular pH. Inorganic phosphorus also increased and correlated with the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration in the first 10 days of postnatal life. The content of red cell 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and ATP increased slightly. These results suggested increased glycolytic flux through the diphosphoglycerate mutase reaction which resulted in net synthesis of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The red cell total triose phosphate peaked and fell initially, followed by glucose-6-phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate suggesting inhibition of phosphofructokinase activity and a decrease in glycolysis secondary to decreased red cell intracellular pH. After 10 days of postnatal life all glycolytic intermediates fell simultaneously, which correlated with a decrease in activity of the glycolytic enzymes.
