Recent studies have demonstrated that most glycolytic enzymes can reversibly associate to form heterogeneous enzyme-enzyme (binary) complexes in vitro. However, kinetic analysis of these complexes has shown that the individual enzymes have a varied response to complex formation: some enzymes are inhibited, some are activated and some are unaffected. In order to determine the potential role of binary complexes in regulating glycolytic flux, we have mathematically calculated enzyme distributions and activities using data from in vitro binding and kinetic studies. These calculations suggest that, overall, formation of binary complexes would lower flux through phosphofructokinase and aldolase, would increase flux through glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, and would not affect flux through triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to the effect of complex formation on overall glycolytic flux and on the flux through individual enzyme loci.
