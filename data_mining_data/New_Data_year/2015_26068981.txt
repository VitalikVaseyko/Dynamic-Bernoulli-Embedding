The nucleophosmin (NPM1) activates cancer development and progression in many malignant tumors. However, the regulatory role and underlying mechanisms of NPM1 in pancreatic cancer are unknown. In this study, we showed that NPM1 was up-regulated in PDAC, which indicated a poor prognosis. We also identified NPM1 could stimulate aerobic glycolysis and repress fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) in pancreatic cancer cells. Restoring FBP1 expression partially reversed the tumor-promoting effects of NPM1, while the loss of FBP1 in PDAC tissues was indicative of a poorer prognosis. In sum, NPM1 promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumor progression in patients with pancreatic cancer by inhibiting FBP1.
