Glucose transport across the plasma membrane of isolated bovine rod outer segments (ROS) was measured by uptake of 14C-labeled 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose and was inferred from deenergization of ROS with 2-deoxyglucose. Glucose transport was mediated by a facilitated diffusion glucose transporter that equilibrated external and internal free hexose concentrations. Glucose transport in ROS displayed two components as judged from kinetic analysis of hexose equilibration and as judged from inhibition by cytochalasin B and phloretin. Transport under exchange conditions was considerably faster as compared with net hexose uptake, similar to that observed for the erythrocyte glucose transporter. Sensitivity to cytochalasin B and affinity to 3-O-methylglucose were similar to those observed for the hepatocyte glucose transporter. The cytochalasin-insensitive component appears unique to ROS and did not reflect leakage transport as judged from a comparison with L-glucose uptake. Glucose transport feeds glycolysis localized to ROS. We suggest that a major role for glycolysis in ROS is phosphorylation of GDP to GTP via pyruvate kinase and PEP, while phosphorylation of ADP to ATP can use the creatine kinase/phosphocreatine pathway as well.
