The C(4) succulent plant Portulaca oleracea shifts its photosynthetic metabolism to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) after 23 d of withholding water. This is accounted by diurnal acid fluctuation, net nocturnal but not day CO(2) uptake and drastic changes in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) kinetic and regulatory properties [Lara et al. (2003) Photosynth: Res. 77: 241]. The goal of the present work was to characterize the CAM activity in leaves of P. oleracea during water stress through the study of enzymes involved in carbon fixation and carbohydrate metabolism. After drought stress, a general decrease in the photosynthetic metabolism, as accounted by the decrease in the net CO(2) fixation and in the activity of enzymes such as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, PEPC, pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and NAD-malic enzyme was observed. We also found changes in the day/night activities and level of immunoreactive protein of some of these enzymes which were correlated to night CO(2) fixation, as occurs under CAM metabolism. Based on the results obtained, including those from in situ immunolocalization studies, we propose a scheme for the possible CO(2) fixation pathways used by P. oleracea under conditions of sufficient and limiting water supply.
