CONTEXT: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is probably the single most important metabolic disease and is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability. Cissus quadrangularis Linn. (Vitaceae) is a medicinal food and is reported to possess hypoglycemic activity. OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluates the effect of ethyl acetate fraction of C. quadrangularis stem (CQSF) on carbohydrate metabolism in hepatic tissues of experimental diabetic rats. The phytochemical compounds present in the CQSF extract were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic animals were treated with CQSF (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 45 d. Several indices such as blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, liver function tests, hepatic glycogen content, and the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes were assayed after 45 d of extract treatment. RESULTS: A pronounced effect was observed with extract doses 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight. CQSF at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight significantly decreased the altered levels of blood glucose by about 56%. CQSF also modulated the activities of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes by significantly increasing the activity of hexokinase (1.9-fold) and pyruvate kinase (2.2-fold) and significantly reducing the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (41.23%), fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (29.43%), and glycogen phosphorylase (35.07%). GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 10 chemical constituents, and N-methyl-1-adamantane acetamide was found to be the prevailing compound in the extract. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The current study suggests the antidiabetic potential of CQSF, mediated through the regulation of carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activities.
