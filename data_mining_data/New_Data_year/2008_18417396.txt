The catabolic and energy metabolism capacities during spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) embryogenesis were investigated. We assessed the embryo's ability to catabolize proteins (trypsin-like proteases) and lipids (triglyceride lipase) and examined the development of metabolic capacities using enzymatic assays: ability to use carbohydrates (pyruvate kinase), amino acids (aspartate aminotransferase) and fatty acids (hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) for energy production, and aerobic (citrate synthase) and anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) energy production. Functional enzymatic systems were detected from the eyed stage (350 degree-days), except for fatty acids, which was detected from 540 degree-days. To compare the development of 1) aerobic and anaerobic pathways and 2) the capacity to mobilize the different energy substrates, enzymatic ratios were calculated. Anaerobic capacity appeared to increase at a significantly higher rate than the aerobic capacity. Ratios revealing the relative capacity to use specific energy substrates showed a significantly slower increase during development in the capacity to use carbohydrates than amino acids and fatty acids. The end of embryogenesis was characterized by a significant decrease in the use of carbohydrates for aerobic energy production but an increasing capacity to use amino acids. Egg survival as affected by the variability in metabolic parameters is discussed.
