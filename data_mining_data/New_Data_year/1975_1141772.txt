Previous reports that rabbit adipose tissue does not synthesize fatty acids at significant rates led us to study in detail the pathways of lipogenesis and glyceroneogenesis in this tissue. We found that rabbit adipose tissue has a low capacity for denovo fatty acid synthesis from glucose but a high capacity for synthesis from pyruvate and acetate. The tissue can also convert pyruvate to glyceride-glycerol via the dicarboxylic acid shuttle and gluconeogenic pathways. Experiments with hydroxycitrate, a potent inhibitor of citrate cleavage enzyme, demonstrated that this is an obligatory enzyme in lipogenesis from pyruvate. The lipogenic system of rabbit adipose tissue resembles that of a ruminant in that it is adapted to utilize acetate rather than glucose. However, in contrast to ruminant tissues, the limited ability to convert glucose to fatty acid results not from a deficiency in the enzymes concerned with the transport of acetyl units out of the mitochondria but from a block prior to the level of pyruvate, most likely at the hexokinase and pyruvate kinase reactions.
