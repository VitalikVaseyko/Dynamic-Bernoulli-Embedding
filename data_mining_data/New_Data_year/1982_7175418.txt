Several regulatory enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism were studied in blastocysts and uteri of mice in which implantation had been delayed and of oestrogen-activated mice, and compared with those of normal mice just before implantation on day 4 of pregnancy. A significant increase in the activities of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase was observed but the level of lactate dehydrogenase declined in delayed blastocysts. Carbohydrate metabolism in the uterus remained essentially unchanged during the delay period. A study of uterine mitotic patterns showed a steady increase in stromal mitosis after administration of oestradiol to animals in which implantation had been delayed.
