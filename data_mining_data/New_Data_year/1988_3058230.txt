Enzymes of the glycolytic pathway as well as some ancillary enzymes were studied in normal red cells parasitized with Plasmodium falciparum in culture at varying parasitemias as well as in isolated parasites. The levels of all enzymes except diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and adenylate kinase were elevated. Extreme elevations of hexokinase, aldolase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, and adenosine deaminase concentrations were noted. In most cases, electrophoretically distinct bands of enzyme activity were also seen. These findings partly explain the previously noted 50- to 100-fold increase in glucose consumption of infected red cells and suggest that further knowledge of these parasite enzymes and their genetic basis may aid both in designing new chemotherapy and in understanding the evolution of these parasites.
