Many cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming known as the Warburg effect, which is characterized by a greater dependence on glycolysis for ATP generation, even under normoxic conditions. Glyoxalase I (GLO I) is a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the detoxification of cytotoxic methylglyoxal formed in glycolysis and which is known to be highly expressed in many cancer cells. Thus, specific inhibitors of GLO I are expected to be effective anticancer drugs. We previously discovered a novel GLO I inhibitor named TLSC702. Although the strong inhibitory activity of TLSC702 was observed in the in vitro enzyme assay, higher concentrations were required to induce apoptosis at the cellular level. One of the proposed reasons for this difference is that cancer cells alter the energy metabolism leading them to become more dependent on mitochondrial respiration than glycolysis (Metabolic shift) to avoid apoptosis induction. Thus, we assumed that combination of TLSC702 with shikonin-a specific inhibitor of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) that acts as a driver of TCA cycle by supplying pyruvate and which is known to be specifically expressed in cancer cells-would have anticancer effects. We herein show the anticancer effects of combination treatment with TLSC702 and shikonin, and a possible anticancer mechanism.
