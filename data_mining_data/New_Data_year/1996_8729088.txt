Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice display a variety of metabolic differences from lean litter mates. In the obese state, fatty acid desaturation-elongation in brown adipose tissue mitochondria is apparently altered, resulting in differences in membrane fatty acid composition. This change in membrane lipid environment appears to influence GDP binding and therefore the activity of the proton conductance pathway associated with regulation of energy expenditure in these animals. In liver, binding of insulin to the nuclear membrane is increased by feeding a high polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) diet fat. Consumption of a high P/S diet decreased mRNA levels for fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, malic enzyme, and pyruvate kinase in obese and lean animals. Expression of mRNA for these lipogenic enzymes was higher in obese animals and suggests that obese mice may be resistant to polyunsaturated fatty acid feedback control of gene expression.
