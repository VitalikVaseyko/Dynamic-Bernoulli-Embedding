Immune tolerance against enteric commensal bacteria is important for preventing intestinal inflammation. Deletion of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) in T cells via Cd4-Cre induced chronic inflammation of the intestine despite the importance of PDK1 in T cell activation. Analysis of colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes of PDK1-deficient mice revealed markedly increased CD8alpha(+) T cell receptor (TCR)gammadelta(+) T cells, including an interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing population. TCRgammadelta(+) T cells were responsible for the inflammatory colitis as shown by the fact that deletion of Tcrd abolished spontaneous colitis in the PDK1-deficient mice. This dysregulation of intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) T cells was attributable to a reduction in the number and functional capacity of PDK1-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells abrogated the spontaneous activation and proliferation of intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) T cells observed in PDK1-deficient mice and prevented the development of colitis. Therefore, suppression of intestinal TCRgammadelta(+) T cells by Treg cells maintains enteric immune tolerance.
