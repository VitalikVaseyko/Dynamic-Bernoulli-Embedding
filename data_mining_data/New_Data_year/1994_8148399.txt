Effects of phenylephrine, oxytocin and angiotensin on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P2) content and glycolytic parameters were studied in incubated thymus lymphocytes. These hormones modified Fru 2,6-P2 content dependent upon the energetic status of the cells. In non-preincubated thymus lymphocytes (with relatively high levels of glycogen and ATP), phenylephrine, oxytocin and angiotensin depressed Fru 2,6-P2 content in a dose-dependent manner. The opposite was found when the cells were preincubated for 2 h without substrates (low levels of ATP and glycogen). Changes in lactate release were less evident, but significant. Phenylephrine did not modify the maximal activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK)-1 or PFK-2. However, both submaximal PFK-1 and PFK-2 activities were inhibited by phenylephrine, and the response to exogenous Fru 2,6-P2 on PFK-1 was also altered. The activities of Fru 1,6-P2 and pyruvate kinase were not modified by phenylephrine or A23187 treatment. Simultaneous presence of Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug, antagonizes the alpha-adrenergic effect on Fru 2,6-P2 content. CsA alone did not alter basal levels of ATP, hexose phosphate or Fru 2,6-P2, and its opposing effect to alpha-agonist was dose-dependent. CsA cannot change the positive action of PMA or the negative action of A23187 on Fru 2,6-P2 content. The present data suggest that CsA acts prior to calcium liberation and protein kinase C activation. Different possible molecular models are discussed.
