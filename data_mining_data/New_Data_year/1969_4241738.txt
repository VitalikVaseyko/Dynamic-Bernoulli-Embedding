1. Extracts of Acetobacter xylinum were found to contain the glycolytic enzymes involved in the conversion of triose phosphate into pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase had the lowest relative activity. Phosphofructokinase activity was not detected in the extracts. 2. Only slight differences in the activity of pyruvate kinase were observed between cells grown on glucose and those grown on intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. 3. Pyruvate kinase, partially purified from ultrasonic extracts by ammonium sulphate fractionation, required Mg(2+) ions for activity. It was not activated by K(+) or NH(4) (+) ions. 4. The plots representing the relationship between initial velocity and phosphoenolpyruvate concentration were sigmoidal, suggesting a co-operative effect for phosphoenolpyruvate. The Hill coefficient (n) for phosphoenolpyruvate was 2. The rate of the reaction changed with increasing ADP concentrations according to normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 5. The enzyme was inhibited by ATP (K(i)0.9x10(-3)m). The inhibition was competitive with regard to ADP but not with regard to phosphoenolpyruvate. It was not relieved by excess of Mg(2+) ions. 6. The possible relationship of the properties of pyruvate kinase to regulatory mechanisms for controlling gluconeogenesis and carbohydrate oxidation in A. xylinum is discussed.
