To determine whether the change in energy metabolism of guinea-pig alveolar macrophages (AM) would alter their function to resemble peritoneal macrophages (PM), AM were exposed to strict anaerobic environments for 96 h. Exposure of cultivated AM to hypoxic conditions resulted in a decreased activity of cytochrome oxidase, a key enzyme in oxidative phosphorylation, whereas pyruvate kinase activity, a key enzyme in glycolysis, increased to levels observed in PM. Under hypoxic conditions the total mitochondrial structure available for respiratory activity also decreased in the glycolytic energy-dependent AM. Accompanying the shift in energy metabolism, adaptive changes in the functional responses of lectin-receptor activity occurred in the AM exposed to hypoxic conditions. Culture of AM in an anaerobic environment led to a loss in their ability to mobilize their lectin receptors in response to cytochalasin B, whereas AM maintained in an aerobic environment could mobilize their receptors in response to either cytochalasin B and D. Alterations in O2 tension affect AM metabolism, morphology and function and indicate that the AM is able to change its energy metabolism according to environmental circumstances.
