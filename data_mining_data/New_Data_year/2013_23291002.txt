Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation and migration of RPE cells characterize the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and other fibro-proliferative eye diseases leading to blindness. A common event in these pathologies is the alteration of the BRB which allows the interaction of RPE cells with thrombin, a pro-inflammatory protease contained in serum. Thrombin promotion of cytoskeletal reorganization, proliferation, and migration has been reported in different cell types, although the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes remain poorly understood. Our previous work demonstrated that thrombin promotes RPE cell proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling and migration, hallmark processes in the development of PVR. Thrombin induction of RPE cell proliferation requires PI3K, PDK1, and Akt/PKB (Akt) signaling leading to cyclin D1 gene expression. Since Akt functions as an upstream activator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and is also a downstream target for mTORC2, the aim of this work was to determine whether mTOR is involved in thrombin-induced RPE cell proliferation by regulating cyclin D1 expression in immortalized rat RPE-J cell line. Results demonstrate that thrombin-induced cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation require Akt-independent phosphorylation/activation of mTOR at Ser 2448 mediated by PI3K/PKC-zeta/ERK1/2 signaling, concomitant to Akt-dependent activation of p70S6K carried by mTORC1.
