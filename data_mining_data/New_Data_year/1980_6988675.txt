Glycolytic parameters were determined in recessive yeast mutants with partial defects in carbon catabolite repression. Specific activities of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate decarboxylase in glucose grown cells of all mutant and wild type strains were 4--5 times higher than in ethanol grown cells. Mutants of gene HEX1 had a reduced hexose phosphorylating activity on all media whereas those of gene HEX2 had elevated levels but only in glucose grown cells. Mutants of gene CAT80 were normal in this respect. All other glycolytic enzymes were normal in all mutants. This was also true for glycolytic intermediates. Only hex1-mutants showed a reduced fermentation of repressing sugars. The three genes appear to be involved in catabolite repression of several but not of all repressible enzymes. Even though all three types of mutants show a limited overlap in their effects on certain enzymes, they still are distinctly different in their action spectra. Carbon catabolite repression apparently does not depend on the sole accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. The activity of the products of the three genes HEX1, HEX2 and CAT80 are required directly or indirectly for triggering carbon catabolite repression. Even a small segment of carbon catabolite repression is controlled by several genes with regulatory functions indicating that the entire regulatory circuit is highly complex.
