AIM: To investigate the effects of globular adiponectin (gAd) on gene expression and whether these effects are mediated through 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-activated protein kinase in skeletal muscle myotubes obtained from lean, obese and obese diabetic individuals. METHODS: Rectus abdominus muscle biopsies were obtained from surgical patients to establish primary skeletal muscle cell cultures. Three distinct primary cell culture groups were established (lean, obese and obese diabetic; n = 7 in each group). Once differentiated, these cultures were then exposed to gAd or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) for 6 h. RESULTS: Stimulation with gAd decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene expression in the obese and diabetic samples (p < or = 0.05) and increased cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4 (COXIV) gene expression in the myotubes derived from lean individuals only (p < 0.05). AICAR treatment also decreased PDK4 gene expression in the obese- and diabetic-derived myotubes (p < or = 0.05) and increased the gene expression of the mitochondrial gene, COXIII, in the lean-derived samples only (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated distinct disparity between myotubes derived from lean compared with obese and obese diabetic individuals following gAd and AICAR treatment. Further understanding of the regulation of PDK4 in obese and diabetic skeletal muscle and its interaction with adiponectin signalling is required as this appears to be an important early molecular event in these disease states that may improve blood glucose control and metabolic flux.
