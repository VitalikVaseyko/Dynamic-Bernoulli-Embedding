5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA) riboside, the nucleoside corresponding to AICA ribotide (AICAR or ZMP), an intermediate of the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis, was found to exert a dose-dependent inhibition on gluconeogenesis in isolated rat hepatocytes. Production of glucose from lactate-pyruvate mixtures was half-maximally inhibited by approximately 100 microM and completely suppressed by 500 microM AICA riboside. AICA riboside also inhibited the production of glucose from all other gluconeogenic precursors investigated, i.e., fructose, dihydroxyacetone, and L-proline. Measurements of intermediates of the glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway showed that AICA riboside provoked elevations of triose phosphates and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and decreases in fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. The effects of AICA riboside persisted when the cells were washed 10 min after its addition but were suppressed by 5-iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase. AICA riboside provoked a dose-dependent buildup of normally undetectable Z nucleotides. After 20 min of incubation with 500 microM AICA riboside, ZMP, ZTP, and ZDP reached 3, 0.3, and 0.1 mumol/g cells, respectively. Concentrations of ATP were not significantly modified by addition of up to 500 microM AICA riboside when the cells were incubated with lactate-pyruvate but decreased with fructose or dihydroxyacetone. The activity of rat liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was inhibited by ZMP with an apparent Ki of 370 microM. It is concluded that AICA riboside exerts a suppressive effect on gluconeogenesis because it provokes an accumulation of ZMP, which inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
