Recent advances on the congenital hemolytic anemia due to enzymopathies related to the red cell glycolytic pathway were summarized based on the review articles and reports. A number of investigations has clarified detailed molecular and genetic aspects of the disease, thus facilitating our understanding on the mechanisms of variable clinical expression, as well as the known limitation to the red cell system in some enzymopathies. These findings are expected to be connected with development of the save and rational therapeutic approaches.
