An analogue of ADP was made in which the terminal phosphono-oxy group, -O-PO(OH)2, has been replaced by the arsonomethyl group, -CH2-AsO(OH)2. This compound cannot form a stable analogue of ATP because anhydrides of arsonic acids are rapidly hydrolysed, so that any enzyme that phosphorylates ADP and accepts this analogue as a substrate should release orthophosphate in its presence. The analogue proves to be a poor substrate for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (V/Km is diminished by a factor of 10(2)-10(3)) and a very poor substrate for pyruvate kinase (V/Km is diminished by a factor of 10(5)-10(6)). No substrate action was detected with adenyl kinase and creatine kinase.
