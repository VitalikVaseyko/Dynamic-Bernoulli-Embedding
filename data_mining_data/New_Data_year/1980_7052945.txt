An experimental arrangement is described which allows studies of the temporal performance of enzyme reactions (also reactions of complexes of enzyme chains) under conditions of open systems. The various steady-state properties of such open systems can be recognized by measuring their input and output [1,2]. The various levels of flowing equilibria are perturbed by applying molecular modulators to the system, and the data obtained are compared to those found in closed systems. In order to prove the accuracy of the experimental configuration, the determination of Km in a one-substrate reaction is carried out in the open system, using only one concentration of substrate at various flow rates.
