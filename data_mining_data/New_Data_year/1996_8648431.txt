The role of glucocorticoids in the intrauterine programming of hypertension was assessed in the progeny of rats fed either 18 g casein/100 g diet (control diet) or 9 g casein/100 g diet (low protein diet), before conception and throughout pregnancy. Rats exposed to the low protein diet had significantly (P < 0.05) higher systolic blood pressures than control animals, when weaned. These rats had elevated brain and liver activities of specific glucocorticoid-inducible marker enzymes, relative to controls. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was also higher (377%) in whole brains of newborn rats exposed to low protein diet in utero, but no similar effect of corticosteroids was noted in brains of d 20 fetuses. Weanling rats of the low protein group exhibited a blunted diurnal pattern of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) concentrations in plasma. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were unaltered by prenatal dietary experience and exhibited a normal pattern of diurnal variation. Brain regional 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were unaltered by prenatal dietary experience, as was binding of 3H-corticosterone to type I glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampus, hypothalamus and liver. Type II glucocorticoid receptor binding capacity and receptor numbers in male rats were apparently elevated in hippocampus of low protein-exposed rats and were significantly lower in liver (P < 0.05), relative to control rats. Programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is inferred, and the observation that binding of steroid to type II receptor sites in vascular tissue is increased in low protein exposed rats may provide a direct mechanism for modulation of blood pressure by glucocorticoids in this model.
