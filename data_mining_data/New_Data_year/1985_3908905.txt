To determine which of the major isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase pancreatic islet pyruvate kinase most resembled, it was compared to pyruvate kinase from other tissues in kinetic and immunologic studies. The pattern of activation by fructose bisphosphate and the patterns of inhibition by alanine and phenylalanine were most similar to those of the M2 isoenzyme from kidney and were dissimilar to those of the isoenzymes from skeletal muscle (type M1) and liver (type L). The islet pyruvate kinase was inhibited by anti-M1 pyruvate kinase serum (which crossreacts with the M2 isoenzyme), but not by anti-L pyruvate kinase. These results are most consistent with islets possessing predominantly, if not exclusively, the M2 isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase. We previously showed that rat pancreatic islet cytosol contains protein kinases that can catalyze a calcium-activated phosphorylation of an endogenous peptide that has properties, such as subunit molecular weight and isoelectric pH, that are identical to those of the M2 and M1 isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase, and that islet cytosol can catalyze phosphorylation of muscle pyruvate kinase. In the present study it was shown that incubating islet cytosol with ATP under conditions known to permit phosphorylation and inhibition of liver pyruvate kinase did not affect the islet pyruvate kinase activity. It is concluded that phosphorylation of the islet pyruvate kinase has no immediate effect on enzyme activity.
