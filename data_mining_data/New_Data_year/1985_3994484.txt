Lactobacillus plantarum P5 grew aerobically in rich media at the expense of lactate; no growth was observed in the absence of aeration. The oxygen-dependent growth was accompanied by the conversion of lactate to acetate which accumulated in the growth medium. Utilization of oxygen with lactate as substrate was observed in buffered suspensions of washed whole cells and in cell-free extracts. A pathway which accounts for the generation of adenosine triphosphate during aerobic metabolism of lactate to acetate via pyruvate and acetyl phosphate is proposed. Each of the enzyme activities involved, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide independent lactic dehydrogenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dependent lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate oxidase, acetate kinase and NADH oxidase were demonstrated in cell-free extracts. The production of pyruvate, acetyl phosphate and acetate was demonstrated using cell-free extracts and cofactors for the enzymes of the proposed pathway.
