Concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, amino acids and possible regulator substances were measured in extracts from locust thoracic muscles perfused under different conditions. The conversion of [(14)C]glucose into intermediates and CO(2) by muscle preparations was also followed. When muscles perfused with glucose were made anaerobic changes in metabolite concentrations occurred that could be accounted for by an activation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. When butyrate and glucose were present in the perfusion medium the rate of glycolytic flux was lower than with glucose alone, and the aldolase reaction appeared to be inhibited. When butyrate alone was supplied to the muscle the concentrations of most glycolytic intermediates were similar to those found when glucose was supplied. Iodoacetate caused changes in concentrations of intermediates that appeared to result from inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Fluoroacetate-poisoned muscles showed a high citrate concentration, but no obvious site of inhibition by citrate was apparent in the glycolytic pathway. Mechanisms for control of glycolysis in locust flight muscle are discussed and related to the known properties of isolated enzymes. It is proposed that trehalase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, and pyruvate kinase may be control enzymes in this tissue.
