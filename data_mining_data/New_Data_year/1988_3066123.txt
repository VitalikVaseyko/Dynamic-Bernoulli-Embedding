We studied the effects of insulin and glucagon on energy and carbohydrate metabolism of rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanism of the synergistic action of insulin and glucagon and to evaluate the combined effects of these hormones on liver injury. Insulin increased the level of adenosine triphosphate in hepatocytes in the presence of glucagon. Insulin increased the activities of glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) type L and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49). Glucagon had no antagonistic effect on these increases. Glucagon increased the activity of glucose 6-phosphate (EC 3.1.3.9) (G6Pase) in the presence or absence of insulin, while insulin had no effects on the levels of G6Pase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) in the presence or absence of glucagon. Metabolite analysis of cultured hepatocytes indicated that insulin and glucagon have antagonistic effects on the glycolytic activity of hepatocytes. These combined effects of insulin and glucagon may partially explain the preventive effects of these hormones on liver injury.
