A novel mutation, FruS localised in the fru operon was obtained. It uncouples expression of the genes determining synthesis of the fructose-specific transport proteins and fructose-1-phosphate kinase. In FruS bacteria the fruA and fruF genes (coding for Enzyme IIfru and FPr, respectively) are constitutive by expressed while fruK (encoding fructose-1-phosphate kinase) remains inducible. In contrast to other mutations, which render expression of the whole fru operon constitutive, the FruS mutation: (1) does not lead to D-xylitol sensitivity; (2) does not inhibit growth on D-lactate, pyruvate and L-alanine; (3) does not decrease phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) synthase activity.
