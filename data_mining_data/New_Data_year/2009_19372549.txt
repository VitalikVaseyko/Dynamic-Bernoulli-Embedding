We aimed to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer by using a proteomic approach. A 5-fold oxaliplatin-resistant cell line, HTOXAR3, was compared with its parental cell line, HT29, using two-dimensional PAGE. Mass spectrometry, Western blot, and real-time quantitative PCR confirmed the down-regulation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PK-M2) in HTOXAR3 cells. In a panel of eight colorectal cancer cell lines, we found a negative correlation between oxaliplatin resistance and PK-M2 mRNA levels (Spearman r=-0.846, P=0.008). Oxaliplatin exposure in both HT29 and HTOXAR3 led to PK-M2 mRNA up-regulation. PK-M2 mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR in 41 tumors treated with oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil. Tumors with the lowest PK-M2 levels attained the lowest response rates (20% versus 64.5%, P=0.026). High PK-M2 levels were associated with high p53 levels (P=0.032). In conclusion, the data provided clearly link PK-M2 expression and oxaliplatin resistance mechanisms and further implicate PK-M2 as a predictive marker of response in patients with oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer.
