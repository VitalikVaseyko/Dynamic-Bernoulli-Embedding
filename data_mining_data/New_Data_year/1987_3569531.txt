A continuous direct spectrophotometric assay for deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase was developed, based on the absorption at 260 nm characteristic of the dihydrothiazine moiety of cephalosporins. Km values of 0.18 mM for penicillin N and 0.16 mM for alpha-ketoglutarate were determined. A coupled assay using succinate thiokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase showed that succinate was a product of both deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase and hydroxylase reactions. The expandase reaction exhibited a 1:1.06 stoichiometry for deacetoxycephalosporin C and succinate.
