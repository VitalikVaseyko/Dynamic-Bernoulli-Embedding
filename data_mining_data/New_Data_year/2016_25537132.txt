Combined effects of vincristine and quercetin in the regulation of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac necrosis have been evaluated in rats. ISO administration (100 mg/kg, s.c., for two consecutive days) increased the levels of serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and cardiac troponin (cTnT) as well as cardiac lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and lipid hydroperoxides). However, it reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and the glutathione peroxidase and the level of reduced glutathione. It also increased the heart rate and ST-segment elevation in ECG. Pretreatment of vincristine (25 mug/kg) or quercetin (10 mg/kg) alone for 2 weeks ameliorated these cardiotoxic effects partially. However, treatment of both vincristine and quercetin for a similar period reduced the serum CK-MB, LDH, SGPT and cTnT levels near to normal levels in ISO-treated rats. Concomitantly, the test drugs improved the status of antioxidants and decreased the cardiac lipid peroxidation products. Combined treatment of both the drugs also restored the pathological electrocardiographic patterns and reduced the area of myocardial necrosis. Histopathology of heart in ISO-administered rats that received both vincristine and quercetin showed nearly normal myocardium with very little inflammatory infiltration. In conclusion, the present finding appears to be the first one, suggesting a better protection of cardiac tissues by combined treatment of vincristine and quercetin in isoproterenol-induced cardiac toxicity.
