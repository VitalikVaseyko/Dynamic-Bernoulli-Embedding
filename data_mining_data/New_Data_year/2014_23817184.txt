BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our earlier studies suggested crosstalk between IRS/PI3 kinase/PDK1/Akt/Rac1/ROCK and (Shc2/Grb2/SOS)/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways downstream PDGF-betabeta receptor responsible for chemotaxis and proliferation of malignant mesothelioma cells. The present study was conducted to obtain evidence for this. METHODS: To assess activation of Akt, MEK, and ERK, Western blotting was carried out on MSTO-211H malignant mesothelioma cells using antibodies against phospho-Thr308-Akt, phopho-Ser473-Akt, Akt, phospho-MEK, MEK, phopho-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2. To knock-down Akt, PI3 kinase, PDK1, and Rac1, siRNAs silencing each-targeted gene were constructed and transfected into cells. To monitor Rac1 activity, FRET monitoring was carried out on living and fixed cells. RESULTS: ERK was activated under the basal conditions in MSTO-211H cells, and the activation was prevented by inhibitors for PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, and Rac1 or by knocking-down PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, and Rac1. Akt was also activated under the basal conditions, and the activation was suppressed by a MEK inhibitor and an ERK1/2 inhibitor. In the FRET analysis, Rac1 was activated under the basal conditions, and the activation was inhibited by a MEK inhibitor and an ERK1/2 inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that ERK could be activated by PI3 kinase, PDK1, Akt, and Rac1 and that alternatively, Akt and Rac1 could be activated by MEK and ERK in MSTO-211H cells.
