PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate whether aspartate (Asp) could improve liver energy status in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged pigs. METHODS: Twenty-four weaned pigs were assigned to four treatments: (1) nonchallenged control (control diet and saline-treated); (2) LPS-challenged control (the same control diet and LPS-challenged); (3) LPS + 0.5% Asp treatment (0.5% Asp diet and LPS-challenged); and (4) LPS + 1.0% Asp treatment (a 1.0% Asp diet and LPS-challenged). On d 19, the pigs were injected intraperitoneally with Escherichia coli LPS at 100 mug/kg body weight, and the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution, respectively. All pigs were slaughtered at 24 h after LPS or saline injection, and the liver was collected for further analysis. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation with Asp improved liver energy status evidenced by the increased ATP concentration and adenylate energy charges, and the decreased AMP concentration and AMP/ATP ratio (p < 0.05). Asp supplementation increased the mRNA expression of key enzymes in hepatic glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, including pyruvate kinase and citrate synthase (p < 0.05), and had a tendency to increase hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase beta mRNA expression (p < 0.10). In addition, Asp increased the mRNA expressions of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha1, AMPKalpha2, silent information regulator (Sirt1), and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) (p < 0.05). Moreover, Asp increased AMPKalpha phosphorylation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that dietary supplementation of Asp could improve energy status in LPS-injured liver, which might result from motivating the metabolism pathway of TCA cycle and glycolysis and stimulating the AMPK signaling pathway.
