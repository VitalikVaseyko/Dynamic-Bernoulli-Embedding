The authors investigated the dependence of increasing serum oncomarkers CEA, Cyfra-21, NSE, TU M2-PK on survival in 739 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer. The tests for the determination of the content of CEA, Cyfra-21, NSE in blood serum have low sensitivity and are of little use for the diagnosis of lung cancer. The tests because of their simplicity and low cost can be used for the detection of groups of patients with preliminarily diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer needing additional methods of examination for more exact staging of the disease and exclusion of remote metastases and more active using adjuvant method of treatment. The use of tumor pyruvate kinase can be perspective for clinical oncopulmonology. However, due to its low specificity, further experiences are required for using this oncomarker in the group of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.
