Cancer cells usually utilize glucose as a carbon source for aerobic glycolysis, which is named as ``Warburg effect''. Recent studies have shown that MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short and non-coding RNAs, play a role in the regulation of metabolic reprograming in cancer cells. In the present study, we report that miR-181b negatively regulates glycolysis in gastric cancer cells. Over-expression of miR-181b mimics reduces the glucose uptake and lactate production, while increasing the cellular ATP levels in NCI-N87 and MGC80-3 cells. At the molecular level, miR-181b directly inhibits the expression level of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a key enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis, through targeting its 3'-untranslated region. In addition, miR-181b represses cell proliferation and migration and is dramatically down-regulated in human gastric cancers. Therefore, our data disclose a novel function of miR-181b in reprogramming the metabolic process in gastric cancer.
