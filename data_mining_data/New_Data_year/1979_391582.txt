Pyruvate kinase from Vibrio costicola, a moderate halophile, appears to be adapted to functioning in the presence of salt. Its stability depends on the ionic strength of the medium. The amino acid composition resembles that of other halophilic enzymes. It is proposed that the halophilic pyruvate kinase utilizes preferentially the Mn++ cofactor which forms more stable complexes in the presence of physiological concentrations of salt.
