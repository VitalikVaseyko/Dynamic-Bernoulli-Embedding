In the heart of sugar-induced hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rats, cardiac performance is impaired with glucose as fuel, but not with fatty acids. Accordingly, the glycolytic flux and the transfer of energy diminish in the HTG heart, in comparison to control heart. To further explore the biochemical nature of such alteration in the HTG heart, the components of the non-glycolytic energy systems involved were evaluated. Total creatine kinase (CK) activity in the myocardial tissue was depressed by 30% in the HTG heart whereas the activity of the mitochondrial CK (mitCK) isoenzyme fraction that is functionally associated with oxidative phosphorylation decreased in isolated HTG heart mitochondria by 45%. Adenylate kinase (AK) was 20% lower in the HTG heart. In contrast, respiratory rates with 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and pyruvate/malate (pyr) were significantly higher in HTG heart mitochondria than in control mitochondria. 2-OG dehydrogenase activity was also higher in HTG mitochondria. Respiration with succinate was similar in both groups. Content of cytochromes b, c + c1 and a + a3, and cytochrome c oxidase activity, were also similar in the two kinds of mitochondria. A larger content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids was found in the HTG mitochondrial membranes with no changes in phospholipids composition or cholesterol content. Mitochondrial membranes from HTG hearts were more rigid, which correlated with the generation of higher membrane potentials. As the mitochondrial function was preserved or even enhanced in the HTG heart, these results indicated that deficiency in energy transfer was associated with impairment in mitCK and AK. This situation brought about uncoupling between the site of ATP production and the site of ATP consumption (contractile machinery), in spite of compensatory increase in mitochondrial oxidative capacity and membrane potential generation.
