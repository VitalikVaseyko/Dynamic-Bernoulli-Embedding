BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) of liver results in hepatocytes (HP) and sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) irreversible damage. Ischemic preconditioning protects IR damage upon adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) stimulation. Understanding the phenotypic changes that underlie hepatocellular damage and protection is critical to optimize strategies against IR. METHODS: The proteome of HP and LSEC, isolated from sham or IR exposed mice, receiving or not the A2aR agonist CGS21680 (0.5mg/kg b.w.), was analyzed by 2-D DIGE/MALDI-TOF. RESULTS: We identified 64 proteins involved in cytoprotection, regeneration, energy metabolism and response to oxidative stress; among them, 34 were associated with IR injury and A2aR protection. The main pathways, downregulated by IR and upregulated by CGS21680 in HP and LSEC, were related to carbohydrate, protein and lipid supply and metabolism. In LSEC, IR reduced stress response enzymes that were instead upregulated by CGS21680 treatment. Functional validation experiments confirmed the metabolic involvement and showed that inhibition of pyruvate kinase, 3-chetoacylCoA thiolase, and arginase reduced the protection by CGS21680 of in vitro hypoxia-reoxygenation injury, whereas their metabolic products induced liver cell protection. Moreover, LSEC, but not HP, were sensitive to H2O2-induced oxidative damage and CGS21680 protected against this effect. CONCLUSIONS: IR and A2aR stimulation produces pathological and protected liver cell phenotypes, respectively characterized by down- and upregulation of proteins involved in the response to O2 and nutrients deprivation during ischemia, oxidative stress, and reactivation of aerobic energy synthesis at reperfusion. This provides novel insights into IR hepatocellular damage and protection, and suggests additional therapeutic options.
