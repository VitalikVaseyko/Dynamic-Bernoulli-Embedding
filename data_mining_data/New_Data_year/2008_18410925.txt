Enhanced glycolysis is observed in most of cancerous cells and tissues, called as the Warburg effect. Recent advance in senescent biology implicates that the metabolic shift to enhanced glycolysis would be involved in the early stage during multi-step tumorigenesis in vivo. Enhanced glycolysis is essential both in the step of immortalization and transformation, as it renders cells resistant to oxidative stress and adaptive to hypoxic condition, respectively. ES, immortalized primary, and cancerous cells display the common concerted metabolic shift, including enhanced glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial respiration by poorly characterized mechanism. Discovery of a novel regulatory mechanism for such a metabolic shift might be essential for the future development of cancer diagnosis and anti-cancer therapy.
