Argininosuccinate Synthetase 1 deficiency induces dependence on extracellular arginine for continued cellular growth and survival. Arginine starvation inhibits the Warburg effect and diverts glucose into serine biosynthesis, while simultaneously increasing glutamine metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Simultaneous arginine deprivation and inhibition of the subsequent metabolic adaptations induce synthetic lethality.
