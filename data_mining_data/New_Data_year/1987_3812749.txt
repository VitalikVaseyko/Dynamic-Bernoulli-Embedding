We compared the perfluorochemical emulsion Fluosol-43 and an erythrocyte-based solution as support media for ex vivo working rabbit hearts functioning with a physiological workload. Both groups of hearts (n = 5/group) exhibited stable function (left ventricular peak systolic pressure, peak rates of left ventricular pressure rise and relaxation, aortic flow, peak aortic flow rate, stroke work, and peak power) for the first 6 h of perfusion. Coronary flow, coronary venous O2 content, and O2 supply-to-demand ratio declined similarly in both groups during the first 6 h. Both groups of hearts preferentially utilized pyruvate to glucose. The Fluosol-43-perfused hearts had higher heart rate, left ventricular peak systolic pressure, peak rate of left ventricular pressure rise, aortic flow, coronary flow, and myocardial O2 consumption compared with the erythrocyte-perfused hearts. The Fluosol-43 hearts produced more lactate and released more creatine phosphokinase than did the erythrocyte-perfused hearts, but the rates were low and constant throughout perfusion, indicating that the hearts were not progressively ischemic. After the first 6 h, function of the Fluosol-43 hearts declined, resulting in their earlier failure compared with the erythrocyte-perfused hearts. The data indicate that Fluosol-43 had sufficient O2- carrying capacity to support stable function of a rabbit heart at a physiological workload for 6 h, and differences in function and ex vivo longevity of the two groups of hearts suggested that a component or contaminant of Fluosol-43 altered sarcolemmal function and/or that a component needed for membrane integrity was lacking in the Fluosol-43 perfusate.
