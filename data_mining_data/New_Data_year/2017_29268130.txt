Shikonin exhibits powerful anticancer activities for various cancer cells, but its poor solubility and strong toxicity hinder its development as clinical anticancer agent. We previously confirmed that shikonin and its derivatives can disturb mitosis through targeting tubulin. In this study, alpha-lipoic acid, the naturally-occurring co-factor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), was introduced into shikonin to design the twin drugs against both mitosis (tubulin) and glycolysis (PDK). 18 kinds of alpha-lipoic acid shikonin ester derivatives were achieved through three rounds of screening process performed by computer assistant drug design method, being designated as the outstanding compounds. Among them, 1c displayed the most potent cytotoxicity towards cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with an IC50 value of 3.14 +/- 0.58 muM and inhibited xenotransplanted tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Further pharmacologic study demonstrated that 1c can cause cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase as tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Moreover, it also showed good PDK1 inhibitory activity, promoting PDH activity and forced HeLa cells to process more aerobic metabolism to undergo cell apoptosis. We reported here the first dual inhibitors of tubulin and PDK1 based on shikonin. It may form a basis for shikonin optimization through twin drug design framework for the discovery of new and potent shikonin derivatives in the study of targeted cancer therapy.
