Tumor tissue oxygenation impacts on proliferation of cancer cells and their sensitivity towards radio- and chemotherapy. Under low oxygen, mammalian cells show an adaptive response that leads to the induction of a number of genes with well-defined roles in oxygen supply and energy maintenance, e.g. genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor consisting of the two proteins HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta, plays a major role in the pleiotropic response observed under low oxygen. We have determined, by Northern analysis, the mRNA levels of HIF-1alpha and of two glycolytic enzymes known to be transcriptionally activated by HIF-1, namely phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK 1) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), in different hepatoma cell lines and in mouse and human tissues. Hypoxic treatment of various mouse and human hepatoma cell lines led to the expected increase in the amount of PGK1 and PKM2 mRNA, while HIF-1alpha mRNA levels were not significantly elevated. Analysis of mouse liver tumors demonstrated no tumor-specific increases in HIF-1alpha or PGK1 mRNA levels. In five of eight human colorectal cancers investigated, PGK1 and PKM2 mRNA levels were increased in comparison to the corresponding normal tissues, while HIF-1alpha mRNA levels were not significantly changed. The majority of the colorectal cancers demonstrated p53 immunoreactivity, presumably due to mutation of the gene; there was, however, no correlation between the p53 staining pattern and mRNA expression levels of glycolytic enzymes.
