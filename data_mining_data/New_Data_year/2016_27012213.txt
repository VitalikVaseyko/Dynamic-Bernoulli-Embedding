Resistance to chemotherapy is a crucial problem in the clinical situation. To overcome this issue, many mechanisms of chemoresistance have been elucidated so far. However, this problem still has not been solved completely. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of chemoresistance from the view of cancer metabolism-related genes, especially focusing on the expression profile of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms, which are rate-limiting enzymes in cancer-specific metabolism (Warburg effect). Herein, we showed that PKM1, which promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), was commonly up-regulated in various chemoresistant cells. To clarify the functions of PKM1 in chemoresistance, we investigated effects of PKM1 expression in DLD-1 parental, 5-FU-resistant and oxaliplatin-resistant DLD-1 cells. The overexpression of PKM1 resulted in resistance of the parental cells to 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Moreover, gene-silencing of PKM1 induced apoptosis in these cells including the resistant cells by causing a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, combination therapy using 5-FU or oxaliplatin with siR-PKM1 was also effective against the resistant cells. Our findings should lead to the development of new agents that can cancel the chemoresistance from the view of cancer energy metabolism.
