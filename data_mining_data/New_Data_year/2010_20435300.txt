A combination of recombinant FKP and alpha-(1-->3)-fucosyltransferase allows the facile synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X tetrasaccharide glycan and its derivatives in excellent yield. In this system, the universal fucosyl donor, guanidine 5'-diphosphate-beta-L-fucose (GDP-fucose), or its analogues can be generated in situ by cofactor recycling using pyruvate kinase.
