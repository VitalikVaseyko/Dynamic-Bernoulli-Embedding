BACKGROUND: N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC), a natural sulfur-containing amino acid derivative, and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligand have been shown to have anticancer properties. However, the mechanisms by which these agents inhibit human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell growth have not been well elucidated. METHODS: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used to knockdown 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), PPARalpha, p65 and p53 genes; Western Blot was performed to detect the protein expression of PDK1, PPARalpha, p65 and p53; Cell viability and MTT assays were carried out to determine the cell proliferation; Transient transfection and Dual-Luciferase Reporter assays were used to transfect siRNAs or exogenous expression vectors, and to measure the gene promoter activity. RESULTS: We showed that NAC inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation through reduction of PDK1 expression. NAC also induced the protein expression of PPARalpha. While PPARalpha ligand enhanced, PPARalpha antagonist and siRNA abrogated the effect of NAC on PDK1 promoter activity, protein expression and cell growth. Overexpression of PDK1 diminished the inhibitory effect of NAC on cell proliferation. NAC induced p53 and reduced p65 protein expression through activation of PPARalpha. Silencing of p53 and overexpression of p65 blocked the effect of NAC on PDK1 promoter activity and protein expression. CONCLUSION: Our results show that NAC inhibits PDK1 expression through PPARalpha-mediated induction of p53 and inhibition of p65 protein expression. PPARalpha ligand enhances the effect of NAC. This ultimately inhibits NSCLC cell growth. This study unveils a novel mechanism by which NAC in combination with PPARalpha ligand inhibits growth of human lung carcinoma cells.
