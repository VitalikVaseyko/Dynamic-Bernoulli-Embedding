OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of extracts of Prunella vulgaris L.on proteome of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry and elucidate the mechanism of anti-lung adenocarcinom effect of Prunella vulgaris L.at the level of proteome. METHODS: The proliferative activity of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was evaluated by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric assay. According to the difference of culture medium, all subjects were divided into the experimental group with culture medium of extracts of Prunella vulgaris L. (300 microg/ml) and the control group with culture medium of DMSO (0.3%). Proteins were isolated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and proteomic maps acquired by silver staining. And proteomic analysis was processed by Image Master 2D Quant Platinum 6.0. The proteins with > 2-fold differences were used to analyze by mass spectrometry and confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: The expressions of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor-interacting protein-like 2 precursor, heat shock cognate protein 70, serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, tropomyosin 2(beta) isoform 1, cyclin B3, MED12L protein and macrophin 1 isoform 2 were higher in experimental group than those in control group (ratio (medicial/normal) 2.051 93, 1 000 001, 2.203 08, 5.042 01, 15.178 00, 1 000 001, 1 000 001) . And the expressions of enolase 1, M2-type pyruvate kinase, heat shock protein 27, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, heat shock protein beta1, TapasinERP57 heterodimer chain A, inorganic pyrophosphatase and mitochondrial Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (putative) were lower in experimental group than those in control group (ratio (medicial/normal) 0.485 18, 0.491 53, 0.465 43, 0.454 71, 0.499 34, 0.450 36, 0.494 62, 0.437 33). CONCLUSIONS: The extracts of Prunella vulgaris L.have multi-target and multi-pathway effects on anti-lung adenocarcinoma. And its possible mechanisms may be due to the regulation of steady state of calcium ion, cell cycle and its steady state and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.
