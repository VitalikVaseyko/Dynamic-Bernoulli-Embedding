We report on a 4-year-old girl with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One of her sisters had grossly elevated serum creatine-kinase and pyruvate-kinase levels, and one of her maternal great uncles was presumptively affected by DMD. Cytogenetic analysis showed a 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX chromosome constitution. The maternally inherited DMD gene is presumed to be present on the single X of the 45,X cell line.
