In spite of the extensive studies on glucose metabolism in surgical field, the postoperative renal and hepatic glucose metabolism and their interrelation have not been reported. The present study was undertaken to interrelate the metabolic states in the kidney and the liver in total gastrectomized dogs. In the kidney, the glycolysis was inhibited in the early postoperative stage whereas the gluconeogenesis was activated. In the late postoperative stage the glycolysis remained slightly inhibited, while the gluconeogenesis remained activated. In the liver, in the early postoperative stage the glycolysis was inhibited, whereas the gluconeogenesis was activated. The glycolysis in the late postoperative stage returned to the preoperative stage, while the gluconeogenesis remained inhibited. The gluconeogenesis in both kidney and liver was disturbed in the early postoperative stage while they were restored, but were reversed, in the late postoperative stage.
