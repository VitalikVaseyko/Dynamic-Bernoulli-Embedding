The erythrocytes of newborn and adult goats were studied with respect to GSH stability, GSH regeneration, levels of ATP and 2, 3-DPG, glucose consumption and activities of nine different enzymes of Embden-Meyerhof and pentose phosphate pathways of glucose metabolism. Red cells from newborn goats had significantly higher levels of ATP and 2, 3-DPG. The activities of all the enzymes measured were also significantly greater in the newborn. It is suggested that newborn goats possess red blood cells that are metabolically more active than those of adult goats.
