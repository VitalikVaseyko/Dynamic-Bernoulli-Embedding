4-Hydroxypentanoic acid alanine thioether was synthesized and characterized by n.m.r. spectroscopy. This derivative corresponded to the modified amino acid obtained by allowing 5-chloro-4-oxo[3,5-3H]pentanoic acid to react with rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. Performic acid oxidation of 4-oxo[3,5-3H]pentanoic acid alanine thioether in pyruvate kinase gave [3H]succinate (67%) and [3H]carboxymethylcysteine (33%) as expected. Evidence is presented to show that NaBH4 reduction followed by periodate oxidation and analysis of radioactive formaldehyde production may provide a convenient method for distinguishing between thiol and amino alkylation by halogenomethyl ketone compounds. Peptide 'mapping' confirms that the modification by 5-chloro-4-oxopentanoic acid occurs primarily at one region of pyruvate kinase.
