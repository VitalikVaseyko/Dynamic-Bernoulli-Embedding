Feeding sheep a concentrate diet compared with grass diets increased the hepatic specific activities of the three glycolytic enzymes studied, and that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and reduced the specific activity of D-fructose-I, 6-diphosphate I-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.11). The specific activities of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.43) and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.40) were unaffected by diet.
