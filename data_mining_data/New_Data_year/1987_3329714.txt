Expression of c-myc has often been related to the control of growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types. However, in some cases, such a relation has not been found. The rate of cell division is very low in liver, but c-myc expression is yet easily detected. We show here that a short-time physiological fasting results in a dramatic decrease of c-myc expression in rat liver. This effect does not seem to be dependent on glucagon, since administration of glucagon leads to an increase in c-myc mRNA. This is to our knowledge, the first evidence of a physiological variation of proto-oncogene expression linked to food intake, and we suggest that this variation could play a role in liver cell growth control.
