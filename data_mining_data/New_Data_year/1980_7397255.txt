When studying enzymic activities in successively chosen portions of solutions of pyruvatekinase, hexokinase, lactatedehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase and trypsin fast macroscopic fluctuations were revealed. These fluctuations were found earlier in protein preparations of the actomyosin complex and creatinkinase and described as "conformation fluctuations". Similar macroscopic fluctuations were also revealed when measuring the rate of reaction between ascorbic acid and dichlorphenolindophenol (DCAPI). The spectra of macroscopic fluctuations in solutions of different proteins and ascorbic acid+DCAPI are similar to each other in principle. This gives grounds to consider the ability towards macroscopic fluctuations to be a common property of solutions of different substances.
