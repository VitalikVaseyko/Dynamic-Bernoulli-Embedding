The effect of chronic sepsis on the concentration of active pyruvate dehydrogenase complex has been investigated in liver and skeletal muscle of normal, sterile inflammatory, and chronic septic (small and large abscess) animals. Hyperdynamic sepsis was induced by the intraperitoneal introduction of a rat fecal-agar pellet of known size and bacterial composition (Escherichia coli + Bacteroides fragilis). Total pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was not altered in either liver or skeletal muscle in any of the conditions studied. In hepatic tissue, sterile inflammation increased the proportion of active complex 2.5-fold compared with control. The same increase in the concentration of active complex was observed in animals with a small abscess. When the abscess size was increased (large abscess), the concentration of active complex was decreased relative to sterile inflammatory or small abscess septic animals. In contrast to liver, sterile inflammation did not alter the proportion of active complex in skeletal muscle. Sepsis (either small or large septic abscess) resulted in threefold decrease in the concentration of active complex relative to control or sterile inflammatory animals. Changes in the concentration of active complex did not appear to be dependent on the ATP/ADP concentration ratio or tissue pyruvate levels but were consistent with changes in the acetyl-coenzyme A-to-coenzyme A concentration ratio. The mechanism responsible for altered concentration of active complex may be mediated through changes in the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, secondary to alterations in the effector concentration ratios.
