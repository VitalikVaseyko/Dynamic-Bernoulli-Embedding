We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 40 kb fragment from the right arm of chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Subsequent analysis revealed 18 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) numbered from 06257 to 06357, an ARS, two tRNA genes and a Ty2 with its flanking elements. Ten ORFs have been sequenced previously: TEA1, RPA43, RPA190, SGC1 (also called TYE7) REV1, PUT4, CIN1, MNE and MRE4 (also called MEK1). Among the others, two seem to code for a new pyruvate kinase and for a new ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; three have interesting homology with genes located on the left arm of chromosome I. This similarity with chromosome I extends to the left of the sequence presented here (Parle et al., submitted to Yeast). The homologous genes on the two chromosomes are placed in the same relative order.
