Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent kinases are central to numerous metabolic processes and mediate the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP). While pyruvate kinase (PK, EC: 2.7.1.40), the final enzyme of the glycolytic pathway is critical in the anaerobic synthesis of ATP from ADP, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK, EC: 2.7.9.1), and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PEPS, EC: 2.7.9.2) help generate ATP from AMP coupled to PEP as a substrate. Here we demonstrate an inexpensive and effective electrophoretic technology to determine the activities of these enzymes by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). The generation of pyruvate is linked to exogenous lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) coupled to 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT) results in a formazan precipitate which is easily quantifiable. The selectivity of the enzymes is ensured by including either AMP or ADP and pyrophosphate (PP(i) ) or inorganic phosphate (P(i) ). Activity bands were readily obtained after incubation in the respective reaction mixtures for 20-30 min. Cell-free extract concentrations as low as 20 mug protein equivalent yielded activity bands and substrate levels were manipulated to optimize sensitivity of this analytical technique. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), two-dimensional (2-D) SDS-PAGE (where SDS is sodium dodecyl sulfate), and immunoblot studies of the excised activity band help further characterize these PEP-dependent kinases. Furthermore, these enzymes were readily identified on the same gel by incubating it sequentially in the respective reaction mixtures. This technique provides a facile method to elucidate these kinases in biological systems.
