Male Wistar rats chronically (15 weeks) fed a sucrose-rich diet (SRD; 63% w/w) developed hypertriglyceridemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Hearts from these animals were isolated and perfused using the Langendorff recirculating method. Glucose at levels similar to those found in the animal in vivo was used as the only exogenous substrate. The hearts were perfused for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of insulin (30 mU/mL) in the perfusion medium. In the absence of the hormone, glucose uptake was impaired and the glucose utilization was reduced, with a significant increase of lactate release. Glucose oxidation, which was estimated from the activation state of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc), was depressed mainly due to both an increase of PDH kinase and a decrease of PDHa (active form of PDHc) activities. Although the addition of insulin in the perfusion medium improved the above parameters, it was unable to normalize them. The present results suggest that at least two different mechanisms might contribute to insulin resistance and to the impaired glucose metabolism in the perfused hearts of the dyslipemic SRD-fed animals: (1) reduced basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and its utilization or (2) increased availability and oxidation of lipids (low PDHa and high PDH kinase activities), which in turn decrease glucose uptake and utilization. Thus, this nutritional experimental model may be useful to study how impaired glucose homeostasis, increases plasma free fatty acid levels and hypertriglyceridemia could contribute to heart tissue malfunction.
