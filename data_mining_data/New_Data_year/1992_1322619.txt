Changes of energy metabolism in maternal leukocytes were studied longitudinally in 33 normal term pregnancies at 12, 20 and 36 weeks of gestation and 40 days post partum. Nutrient intakes were calculated from 3-day weighed food records at the same periods. Women tended to decrease their mean dietary intakes of energy and of most nutrients from early to late pregnancy. Glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (G6P-DH), pyruvic kinase (PK) and adenylate kinase (AK) activities rose significantly after the 12th week of pregnancy, reaching maximal values at week 20. The following period up to week 36 showed a significant decrease that continued in the puerperium, when their values were lowest. Adenine nucleotide contents and protein/DNA ratio followed a different pattern. A significant increase was also observed from weeks 12 to 20, remaining without changes during the second half of gestation, and falling at puerperium. The PK and AK activities showed a positive correlation with energy intake at 36 weeks of gestation and AK activity was negatively correlated with folic acid intake in the middle of pregnancy. At week 20, PK activity showed a positive correlation with both head circumference and body mass index of the newborn. There was also a correlation between protein/DNA ratio and head circumference at the 36th week of gestation. These findings may suggest a relationship between the metabolism of maternal leukocytes, and fetal development in utero.
