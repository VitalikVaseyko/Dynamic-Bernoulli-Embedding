Mutants of Escherichia coli K12 have been isolated that grow on media containing pyruvate of proline as sole carbon sources despite the presence of 10 or 50 mM-sodium fluoroacetate. Such mutants lack either acetate kinase [ATP: acetate phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.2.1] or phosphotransacetylase [acetyl-CoA: orthophosphate acetyltransferase; EC 2.3.1.8] activity. Unlike wild-type E. coli, phosphotransacetylase mutants do not excrete acetate when growing aerobically or anaerobically on glucose; their anaerobic growth on this sugar is slow. The genes that specify acetate kinase (ack) and phosphotransacetylase (pta) activities are cotransducible with each other and with purF and are thus located at about min 50 on the E. coli linkage map. Although Pta- and Ack- mutants are greatly impaired in their growth on acetate, they incorporate [2-14C]acetate added to cultures growing on glycerol, but not on glucose. An inducible acetyl-CoA synthetase [acetate: CoA ligase (AMP-forming); EC 6.2.1.1] effects this uptake of acetate.
