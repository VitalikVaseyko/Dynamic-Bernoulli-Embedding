Prostate cancer (PCa) represents one of the most common solid neoplasms, and metastasis is the second leading cause of death in adult males. Anoikis is a programmed cell death that is induced upon cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), which behaves as a critical protective mechanism for anchorage-independent cell growth and metastasis formation. However, in the absence of ECM attachment, shift of metabolic pattern and tolerance to anoikis facilitate the survival of aggressive cancer cells in the circulatory system as well as their metastasis to distant sites. Few molecular targets in PCa have thus far been reported to prevent anoikis resistance, metabolic reprogramming, and metastasis simultaneously. In the present study, elevated migration, invasion, pyruvate production, lactate generation, ATP level, and impaired detachment-induced apoptosis were found in anoikis-resistant PCa cells, and genome microarray analysis demonstrated that the cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) was a potential molecular target for the regulation of the aforementioned malignant behaviors. Additional investigation revealed that the AMPK/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)/beta-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression in anoikis-resistant PCa cells might be implicated in local progression, metabolic shift, and cellular migration and invasion, whereas knockout of CEMIP by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 in anoikis-resistant PCa cells reversed the described bioeffects by reducing expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), VEGF, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), and lactate dehydrogenase A. In addition, inhibition of glycolysis by CEMIP-mediated PDK4 down-regulation impaired the migration and invasion of anoikis-resistant PCa cells by attenuating MMP2 and VEGF expressions. Our findings establish that AMPK/GSK3beta/beta-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression might promote migration and invasion in anoikis-resistant PCa cells by enhancing PDK4-associated metabolic reprogramming, which may provide a novel, promising therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced PCa.-Zhang, P., Song, Y., Sun, Y., Li, X., Chen, L., Yang, L., Xing, Y.
