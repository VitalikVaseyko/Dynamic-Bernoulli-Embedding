In animals the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is mainly responsible for the irreversible loss of glucose carbon by oxidation. Regulation of this reaction is shown to be a major determinant of glucose conservation in starvation and diabetes. Estimates of conservation in man in starvation and diabetes are reviewed. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is inhibited by products of its reactions; it is also regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle catalysed by a kinase intrinsic to the complex and by a more loosely associated phosphatase. Inactivation is largely accomplished by phosphorylation of the tetrameric decarboxylase component (alpha2beta2) to alpha2Pbeta2. Complete phosphorylation produces the (alpha2P3)beta2 form. Both forms are completely reactivated by phosphatase action but the initial rate of reactivation of a complex containing alpha2Pbeta2 is approximately three times that of (alpha2P3)beta2. The proportion of active (dephosphorylated) complex is decreased in rat tissues by starvation and diabetes and in perfused rat heart by oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. In adipose tissue in vitro, insulin increases the proportion of active complex and lipolytic hormones may decrease this proportion. It is suggested that rates of oxidation of lipid fuels may be a major determinant of the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in tissues in relation to the actions of insulin and lipolytic hormones and the effects of diabetes and starvation. Phosphorylation and inactivation of the complex are enhanced by high mitochondrial ratios of [acetyl-CoA]/[CoA], [ATP]/[ADP], [NADH]/[NAD+] and low concentrations of pyruvate, Mg2+ and Ca2+, and vice versa.
