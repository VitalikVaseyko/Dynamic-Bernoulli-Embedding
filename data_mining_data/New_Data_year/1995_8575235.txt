A biochemical some enzymes of glycolysis and a partial reversed tricarboxylic acid cycle together with hydrolytic enzymes in the cyst wall of Echinococcus granulosus was carried out. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) showed their high level of activity, suggesting that the proliferation of E. granulosus cyst wall is an energy-dependent process and the major pathways for glucose metabolism is glycolysis. Treatment of E. granulosus-infected mice with mebendazole and albendazole resulted in marked inhibition of PK, PEPCK and ATPase of E. granulosus cyst wall, whereas praziquantel had no effect, indicating that PK, PEPCK, and ATPase might be chemotherapeutic targets and the differences in the inhibitory effects might account for the efficacy of the three antihydatid drugs.
