Yeast cells, cell debris and protein partitioning have been investigated in the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 10,000 system. Cells and cell debris partition into the lower (PVA) phase over the pH range 4.8-7.5, and with up to 0.37 M KCl at pH 5.9. Protein partitioning is more pH-dependent in the PEG/PVA system than in the PEG/dextran system, and a significant fraction of the total protein is found at the interface at lower pH values. Significant, rapid purification of overproduced pyruvate kinase in a PEG/PVA system containing Blue Sepharose CL-6B particles is demonstrated.
