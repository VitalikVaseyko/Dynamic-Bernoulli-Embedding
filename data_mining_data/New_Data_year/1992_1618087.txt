Biochemical method was adopted to examine 10 kinds of histologic enzyme spectrum activities in gastric intestinal metaplasia, carcinoma and normal or superficial gastritis mucosa taken from different sites from 17 fresh surgical specimens of stomach. The enzymes are aldolase (ALD), pyruvate kinase (PYK), phospho hexo-isomerase (PHI), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), acid phosphatase (ACP), r-glutamyl-transpeptidase (gamma-GT). Among glycolytic enzymes the content of ALD, PYK in intestinal metaplasia were 24.5 u and 24.6 u respectively, which were higher than those in the normal mucosa (15.7, 18.0) and lower than carcinoma (28.4, 29.6) (P less than 0.01-0.05). The content of CPK in intestinal metaplasia was lower (218.5 u) than that in the normal (463.9 u) and higher than that in carcinoma (110.3 u) (P less than 0.01). Among protease and amino acid enzymes the content of HBD in intestinal metaplasia was lower (108.2 u) than those in the normal (221.3 u) and carcinoma (113.9 u) (P less than 0.05). The content of GPT in intestinal metaplasia was (6.7 u) which was lower than that in the normal (9.4 u) and higher than that in carcinoma (3.7 u) (P less than 0.01). The above results could provide reference indices for judging the potential malignancy of gastric intestinal metaplasia.
