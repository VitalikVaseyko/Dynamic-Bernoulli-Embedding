1. Tetrodotoxin, at concentrations at which it abolishes generation of action potentials in the nervous system, enhances by about 300% the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of brain-cortex slices from adult rats, or from adult and infant guinea pigs. This occurs to a greater extent in Ca(2+)-deficient incubation media than in Ca(2+)-rich media. Tetrodotoxin has no accelerative effect on cerebral aerobic glycolysis. 2. Tetrodotoxin does not affect the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of 2-day-old rat brain-cortex slices, nor that of adult rat kidney medulla, nor that of an extract of an acetone-dried powder of brain. 3. Tetrodotoxin does not affect the rate of penetration of glucose into brain slices. 4. Its effect is not apparent if it is added 10min or later after the onset of anoxia. 5. Its effect diminishes as the concentration of K(+) in the incubation medium is increased while that of Na(+) is decreased. 6. Its salient effect, at the onset of anoxia, is to diminish influx of Na(+) into, and efflux of K(+) from, the brain slices. 7. Substances that promote cerebral influx of Na(+), e.g. protoveratrine, sodium l-glutamate, diminish the accelerative action of tetrodotoxin. 8. It is concluded that tetrodotoxin exerts its effect on anaerobic glycolysis by suppressing, at the onset of anoxia, the generation of action potentials and thereby the accompanying influx of Na(+) and efflux of K(+). It is suggested that glycolytic stimulation occurs because a rate-limiting step, e.g. operation of pyruvate kinase, is stimulated by K(+) and depressed by Na(+). 9. Local anaesthetics behave in a manner similar to that of tetrodotoxin in enhancing cerebral anaerobic glycolysis. 10. Sodium Amytal has a marked effect at relatively high concentration. 11. Tetrodotoxin diminishes efflux of amino acids, particularly glutamate and aspartate, at the onset of anoxia.
