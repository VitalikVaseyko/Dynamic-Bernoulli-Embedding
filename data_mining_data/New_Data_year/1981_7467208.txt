Everyday administration of citrate (250 mg/kg of body mass) into healthy rats within 4 days inhibited activities of pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase and of reverse lactate dehydrogenase in liver tissue but not in sceletal muscles. Within the longer period of citrate administration (8 or 12 days) activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alanine transaminase continued to decrease in liver tissue, at the same time, content of pyruvate proceeded to increase in sceletal muscles. More distinct inhibitory effect of citrate on the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed not only in liver tissue but and in sceletal muscles of tumor-bearing animals. Alanine transaminase, which was inactivated in liver tissue of healthy animals after citrate treatment, was markedly activated in tumor-bearing rats in the same conditions. The data obtained suggest that some regulatory functions of citrate were qualitatively transformed in tumor-bearing animals, mainly, in relation to turnover of glucogenic amino acids.
