Perfusion of the rat liver in situ for 150 min provides for maintaining optimal values of acid-base balance for the following indexes: surplus of bases, content of standard bicarbonate, buffer bases pH, pO2, pCO2, HbO2, the level of bile secretion, content of lactate, pyruvate, ATP, ADP, that evidences for a high functional activity in the tissue. Introduction of dinitro-ortho-cresol (DNC) into the perfusion liquid causes development of acidosis. DNC results in dissociation of oxidative phosphorylation: the content of ATP and intensity of inorganic phosphorus utilization decrease, oxygen uptake intensifies. A compensatory increase in the glycolysis intensity directed to maintaining the level of macroergs under these conditions is is pronounced in the intensified uptake of glucose, in a rise in the content of lactate in perfusate and an increase in the pyruvate kinase activity in the liver. The redox state of NAD-pairs (ratio of [NAD+] : [NADN] calculated from the content of redox metabolites and the equilibrium constant for the lactate dehydrogenase system shifts toward an increase in the reducing properties of hepatocytes cytoplasm. The phosphate potential value calculated from the ratio [ATP] : [ADP] - [Pinor] lowers under conditions of the experiment.
