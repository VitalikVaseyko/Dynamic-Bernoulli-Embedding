In liver, L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK) was considered to be the major isozyme. Using an immunocytometric method, it was demonstrated that labeled LPK (LPK+) hepatocytes were largely influenced by the nutritional status of the Rat, as well as addition of glucagon in vitro. In the fed Rats, the percentage of LPK-hepatocytes remained stable for at least 90 min. This decreased to one half value in the fasted Rats. Addition of glucagon (114 nM) had no effect in fasted Rats, but decreased the percentage of LPK-hepatocytes to a half in the fed Rats. It was concluded that neoglucogenesis status (fasting or addition of glucagon in fed Rats liver cells) induced a fall in the percentage of LPK-hepatocytes.
