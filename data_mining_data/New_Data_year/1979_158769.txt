For 14 days, SPF male Wistar rats with an initial weight of 60 g were given isocaloric diets (1.7 MJ/100 g diet) containing 10% protein (casein) and 5, 10, 25 and 40% fat (margarine). Two utilization parameters of the protein biological value--net protein utilization (NPU) and liver protein utilization (LPU)--were determined from protein intake and body and liver nitrogen. These results were supplemented by a study of the course of the antithetical processes of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, of the citric acid cycle and transamination processes and of the liver and muscle amino acid spectrum. A high (40%) fat diet significantly reduced the protein biological value parameters NPU and LPU and liver and muscle amino acid values, stimulated gluconeogenesis and inhibited glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, together with associated transamination processes in the liver. Activation of these processes in the muscles provided substrates for increased gluconeogenesis. The negative effect of a low fat + high carbohydrate diet was less marked. The optimum diet for weaned rats is thus a diet containing 10% protein and 10--25% fat. The study, which submits several possible ways of determining optimum nutrient intakes under different physiological conditions shows that diets with more detailed nutrient concentrations should be used.
