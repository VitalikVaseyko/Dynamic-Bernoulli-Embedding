Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by the dysfunction of mitochondrial energy metabolism, which is associated with the functional impairment of succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a potent irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, replicates most of the pathophysiological features of HD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of (-)schisandrin B [(-)Sch B, a potent enantiomer of schisandrin B] on 3-NP-induced cell injury in rat differentiated neuronal PC12 cells. The 3-NP caused cell necrosis, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and mitochondrion-dependent cell apoptosis, as assessed by caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, in differentiated PC12 cells. The cytotoxicity induced by 3-NP was associated with a depletion of cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as the activation of redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and the inhibition of PDH. (-)Sch B pretreatment (5 and 15 muM) significantly reduced the extent of necrotic and apoptotic cell death in 3-NP-challenged cells. The cytoprotection afforded by (-)Sch B pretreatment was associated with the attenuation of 3-NP-induced GSH depletion as well as JNK activation and PDH inhibition. (-)Sch B pretreatment enhanced cellular glutathione redox status and ameliorated the 3-NP-induced cellular energy crisis, presumably by suppressing the activated JNK-mediated PDH inhibition, thereby protecting against necrotic and apoptotic cell death in differentiated PC12 cells.
