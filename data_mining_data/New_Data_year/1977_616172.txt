The effect of thyroid hormone on renin productiona and release by rat kidney slices was studied. Rat kidney slices were incubated in Warburg flasks containing Krebs-Ringer-Phosphate- Glucose- Dextran solution at 37 C for 5 hours. Renin content, renin released into the incubation media and oxygen consumption were measured. Kidney slices actively secreted renin. Kidney slices of hyperthyroid rats released more renin, and kidney slices of hypothyroid rats released less renin than normal kidneys (p less than 0.001). The addition of 1-thyroxine to the incubation medium increased significantly (p less than 0.001) renin release by kidney slices from normal and hypothyroid rats. Thyroid hormone affects renin release through a mechanism independent of the ouabain-sensitive sodium pump and protein synthesis, since ouabain and cycloheximide did not modify renin release or production. The results of this study suggest that thyroid hormone plays a role in renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells.
