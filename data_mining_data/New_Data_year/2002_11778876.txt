Carbon destined for lysine synthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 21799 can be diverted toward threonine by overexpression of genes encoding a feedback-insensitive homoserine dehydrogenase (hom(dr)) and homoserine kinase (thrB). We studied the effects of introducing two different threonine dehydratase genes into this threonine-producing system to gauge their effects on isoleucine production. Co-expression of hom(dr), thrB, and ilvA, which encodes a native threonine dehydratase, caused isoleucine to accumulate to a final concentration of 2.2+/-0.2 g l(-1), five-fold more than accumulates in the wild-type strain, and approximately twice as much as accumulates in the strain expressing only hom(dr) and thrB. Comparing these data with previous results, we found that overexpression of the three genes, hom(dr), thrB, and ilvA, in C. glutamicum ATCC 21799 is no better in terms of isoleucine production than the expression of a single gene, tdcB, encoding a catabolic threonine dehydratase from Escherichia coli. Co-expression of hom(dr), thrB, and tdcB, however, caused the concentration of isoleucine to increase 20-fold compared to the wild-type strain, about four times more than the corresponding ilvA-expressing strain. In this system, the apparent yield of isoleucine production was multiplied by a factor of two [2.1 mmol (g dry cell weight)(-1)]. While the balance of excreted metabolites showed that the carbon flow in this strain was completely redirected from the lysine pathway into the isoleucine pathway, it also showed that more pyruvate was diverted into amino acid synthesis.
