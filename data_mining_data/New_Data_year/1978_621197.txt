Rat hepatic pyruvate kinase (type L) has been purified to homogeneity by a simple, rapid procedure involving DEAE-cellulose chromatography and elution from a blue Sepharose column. The enzyme was homogeneous by the criteria of sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis, had a subunit molecular weight of 57,000, and a specific activity of 558 units/mg of protein at 30 degrees. In order to test whether the enzyme is phosphorylated in vivo, rats were injected with radioactive inorganic phosphate. Incorporation into pyruvate kinase was determined after purification of the enzyme to homogeneity as well as after specific immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from partially purified preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis revealed that 32P was incorporated into the enzyme in both cases. Glucagon administration in vivo resulted in a 200 to 300% increase in the incorporation of 32P into the enzyme which was correlated with an inhibition of enzyme activity and an elevation of hepatic levels of cyclic AMP. These results represent the first demonstration of in vivo phosphorylation of a hepatic glycolytic enzyme and strongly support the hypothesis that glucagon regulates pyruvate kinase activity, at least in part, by a phosphorylation mechanism.
