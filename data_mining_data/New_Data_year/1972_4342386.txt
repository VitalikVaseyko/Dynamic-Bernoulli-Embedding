1. A study has been made of the ability of rat liver in vivo to maintain equilibrium in the combined glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase reactions, i.e. in the system: [Formula: see text] Attempts were made to upset equilibrium. The [lactate]/[pyruvate] ratio was rapidly changed by injection of ethanol or crotyl alcohol, and the value of [ATP]/[ADP][HPO(4) (2-)] was rapidly changed by injection of ethionine or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone. 2. The concentrations of the metabolites occurring in the above equation were measured in freeze-clamped liver. 3. Although the injected agents caused large changes in the concentrations of the individual components, near-equilibrium in the system was maintained, as indicated by the fact that the value of [ATP]/[ADP][HPO(4) (2-)], referred to as the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotides, measured directly agreed with the value calculated for equilibrium conditions from the above equation. 4. The results are discussed and taken to confirm that the order of magnitude of the value of the redox state of the cytoplasmic NAD couple in rat liver is controlled by the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotide system.
