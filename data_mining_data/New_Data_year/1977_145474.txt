Extensor digitorum longus muscles of rats were removed and injected with a solution of Marcaine plus hyaluronidase. After incubation in Marcaine solution for 10 min, the muscles were grafted into their original beds. The grafts and the contralateral control muscles were removed from the rats at 0, 1-5, 7, 11, 36, and 69 days postoperatively. The muscles were then frozen in dry ice and isopentane and subsequently homogenized and centrifuged. The supernatant was analyzed for a number of enzymes, the regenerative patterns of which can be classified into 3 groups: (1) early increase in activity: hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; (2) early decrease in activity with failure to recover to control levels: phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase; and (3) early decrease followed by return to control levels: lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine phosphokinase, adenylate kinase. These patterns are not identical to those reported for embryogenesis of muscle. The data are discussed with regard to correlative histological studies of muscle regeneration.
