To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of lithium on cells, in this study, we exposed SH-SY5Y cells to 0.5 mmol/L lithium carbonate (Li2CO2) for 25-50 weeks and then detected the expression levels of some neurobiology related genes and post-translational modifications of stress proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. cDNA arrays showed that pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) and calmodulin 3 (CaM 3) expression levels were significantly down-regulated, phosphatase protein PP2A expression was lightly down-regulated, and casein kinase II (CK2), threonine/tyrosine phosphatase 7 (PYST2), and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) expression levels were significantly up-regulated. Besides, western blot analysis of stress proteins (HSP27, HSP70, GRP78 and GRP94) showed an over-expression of two proteins: a 105 kDa protein which is a hyper-phosphorylated isoform of GRP94, and a 108 kDa protein which is a phosphorylated tetramer of HSP27. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of lithium are likely related to gene expressions and post-translational modifications of proteins cited above.
