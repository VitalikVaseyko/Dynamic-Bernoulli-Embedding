Recent findings suggest that high glucose levels may promote atherosclerosis in coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). To explore the intracellular mechanisms of action by which troglitazone affects this process, we examined the effect of troglitazone on the migration and growth characteristics of cultured rabbit coronary VSMCs. Treatment with chronic high glucose medium (22.2 mmol/L) for 5 days increased VSMC migration by 92%, [3H]thymidine incorporation by 135%, and cell number by 32% compared with VSMCs treated with normal glucose (5.5 mmol/L glucose + 16.6 mmol/L mannose) medium. Trolitazone at 100 nmol/L and 1 mumol/L significantly suppressed high glucose-induced VSMC migration by 34% and 42%, respectively, the proliferative effect (as measured by cell number) by 17% and 27%, and [3H]thymidine incorporation by 45% and 60% (n = 6, P < .05). The high glucose-induced impairment of insulin-mediated [3H]deoxyglucose uptake was blocked by a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (calphostin C, 1 mumol/L) and was also improved by troglitazone without any change in insulin receptor number and affinity. The high glucose-induced insulin-mediated increase in cell number and in [3H]thymidine incorporation was suppressed by troglitazone. Troglitazone (1 mumol/L) also suppressed high glucose-induced phospholipase D activation, elevation of the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio (as measured by the cytosolic ratio of lactate/pyruvate), and membrane-bound PKC activation. Flow cytometric DNA histogram analysis of cell cycle stage showed that high glucose-induced increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase was suppressed by 1 mumol/L troglitazone. These findings suggest that PKC may be a link between impairment of insulin-mediated glucose uptake and the increase in migration and proliferation induced by high glucose levels and that troglitazone may be clinically useful for the treatment of high glucose-induced coronary atherosclerosis.
