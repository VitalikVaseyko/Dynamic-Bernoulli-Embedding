Transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses were combined to determine the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in nongenotoxic signaling and energy homeostasis in liver after rats were repeatedly orally dosed with the PXR agonist pregnenolone carbonitrile (PCN) for 7 days. Analyses of mRNAs and proteins in the supernatant, membrane, and cytosolic fractions of enlarged liver homogenates showed diverse expression profiles. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that the synchronous increase in mRNAs and proteins involved in chemical carcinogenesis and the response to drug was possibly mediated by the PXR pathway and proteasome core complex assembly was possibly mediated by the Nrf2 pathway. In addition, levels of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and involved in the acute-phase response showed specific increase with no change in mRNA level, and those composed of the mitochondrial inner membrane showed specific decrease. The analysis of phosphorylated peptides of poly(A) RNA binding proteins showed a decrease in phosphorylation, possibly by casein kinase 2, which may be related to the regulation of protein expression. Proteins involved in insulin signaling pathways showed an increase in phosphorylation, possibly by protein kinase A, and those involved in apoptosis showed a decrease. Metabolomic analysis suggested the activation of the pentose phosphate and anaerobic glycolysis pathways and the increase of amino acid and fatty acid levels, as occurs in the Warburg effect. In conclusion, the results of combined analyses suggest that PXR's effects are due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation with alteration of nongenotoxic signaling pathways and energy homeostasis.
