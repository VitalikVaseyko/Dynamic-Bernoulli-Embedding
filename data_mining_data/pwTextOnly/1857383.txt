Pyruvate kinase from Trypanosoma brucei is a labile enzyme, losing its activity within several hours. In mixtures containing 50 mM triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.2, 25% glycerol and 0.5 mM inorganic phosphate the enzyme remained active and could be purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 417 units mg-1 and a yield of 65%. The enzyme has an activation energy of 31.9 kJ mol-1. Magnesium and potassium ions are essential for activity. Cobalt or manganese ions replace Mg2+ but this leads to a decrease in maximal velocity. Potassium ions can be substituted by ammonium ions, while sodium ions behave as a competitive inhibitor with respect to both K+ and NH4+. All metal ions studied displayed sigmoidal kinetics. The enzyme is activated, with decreasing efficiency by fructose 2-phosphorothioate 6-phosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. They all display hyperbolic kinetics. Glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, CoASAc, oxalate, AMP, ADP, and ATP inhibit the enzyme. At substrate saturation PK was activated by Pi up to a concentration of 0.8 mM. At higher Pi concentrations the enzyme is inhibited. The enzyme is unaffected by most amino acids, only phenylalanine stimulates and tyrosine inhibits.
