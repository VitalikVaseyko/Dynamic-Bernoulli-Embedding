Extracts of Pseudomonas citronellolis cells grown on glucose or gluconate possessed all the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Gluconokinase and either or both 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and KDPG aldolase were induced by growth on these substrates. Glucose and gluconate dehydrogenases and 6-phosphofructokinase were not detected. Thus catabolism of glucose proceeds via an inducible Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Metabolism of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate apparently proceeded via glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase and pyruvate kinase. These same enzymes plus triose phosphate isomerase were present in lactate-grown cells indicating that synthesis of triose phosphates from gluconeogenic substrates also occurs via this pathway. Extracts of lactate grown-cells possessed fructose diphosphatase and phosphohexoisomerase but apparently lacked fructose diphosphate aldolase thus indicating either the presence of an aldolase with unusual properties or requirements or an alternative pathway for the conversion of triose phosphate to fructose disphosphate. Cells contained two species of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one an NAD-dependent enzyme which predominated when the organism was grown on glycolytic substrates and the other, an NADP-dependent enzyme which predominated when the organism was grown on gluconeogenic substrates.
