We describe protocols for the fractionation of isolated hepatocytes into eight sub-populations using centrifugal elutriation. The distribution of fluorescein isothiocyanate and acridine orange in hepatocytes prepared from livers pre-perfused with one of these dyes is described and used as an indicator of acinar zone derivation for each population. The cytochrome P-450 content and response to induction by 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbitone; the distribution of lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, pyruvate kinase and tyrosine aminotransferase activities in the sub-populations is also reported. A marked asymmetry of distribution in all these activities was observed. On the basis of putative zone derivations (based on data of fluorescent dye distribution) of eight factors studied, the distributions of six were consistent with the sub-populations being derived from different acinar zones. Two major discrepancies were noted however, the distribution of pyruvate kinase activity and the response of the sub-populations to phenobarbitone. We conclude from this study that while a metabolic heterogeneity was revealed in the sub-populations generated, further characterisation is required to determine whether acinar zone separation has occurred and if so to what extent.
