It has been proposed (Grosse et al. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 603, 142-156) that membrane-bound creatine kinase and the ATP-dependent Na+ pump form a functional complex in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. In this model ADP produced at Na+ pump sites would be rephosphorylated by the creatine kinase for preferential delivery back to the Na+ pump. We have reexamined this hypothesis and find that under some conditions active Na+ transport can be stimulated by ATP produced by sarcolemmal creatine kinase. However, the characteristics of this stimulation are no different than stimulation produced by an added soluble ATP-regenerating system (phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase). Thus, we are unable to detect coupling between the Na+ pump and sarcolemmal creatine kinase.
