We evaluated the effect of hemolysis, icteric discoloration, lipemia, paraproteinemia, and uremia on enzymatic methods for determining sodium, potassium, and chloride, according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards EP7-P proposals for testing interference from endogenous substances. The sodium, potassium, and chloride assays (reagent kits supplied by Boehringer Mannheim) were based on electrolyte-dependent beta-galactosidase, pyruvate kinase, and alpha-amylase, respectively. The results were compared with those obtained by indirect ion-selective electrodes (ISE), which in turn had been validated by flame photometry. We analyzed the samples with Hitachi 717, 737, and 911 chemistry analyzers and with an IL943 flame photometer. The enzymatic results were in good agreement with those by ISE, the interference-related differences generally being without clinical significance; however, none of the enzymatic methods could analyze grossly lipemic samples.
