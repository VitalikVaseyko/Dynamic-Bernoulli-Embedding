During our investigation on the effect of some fatty acids on the germination of Pinus pinea seeds (Vincenzini et al., 1973), we noted a marked decrease of G6PDH activity when octanoate or oleate were added to the culture medium. In an attempt to provide biochemical information on the effect of free fatty acids on G6PDH activity, in vivo, during Pinus pinea seeds germination, we tested different concentrations of octanoate and oleate added to the culture medium. Moreover other enzymes of fundamental metabolic pathways were also considered, particularly 6PGDH, the second enzyme of HMS.
