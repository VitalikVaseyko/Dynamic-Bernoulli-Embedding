Glucagon (0.04-0.09 mg/kg/min) was given intravenously for either 2 or 3 min to eight patients with fasting-induced hypoglycemia. One child had hepatic phosphorylase deficiency, two children had glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency, two children had debrancher enzyme (amylo-1,6-glucosidase) deficiency, and two children and one adult had decreased hepatic fructose-1,6-diphosphatase (FDPase) activity. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained before and immediately after the glucagon infusion. The glucagon caused a significant increase in the activity of FDPase (from 50+/-10.0 to 72+/-11.7 nmol/mg protein/min) and a significant decrease in the activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK) (from 92+/-6.1 to 41+/-8.1 nmol/mg protein/min) and pyruvate kinase (PK) (from 309+/-39.4 to 165+/-23.9 nmol/mg protein/min). The glucagon infusion also caused a significant increase in hepatic cyclic AMP concentrations (from 41+/-2.6 to 233+/-35.6 pmol/mg protein). Two patients with debrancher enzyme deficiency who had biopsy specimens taken 5 min after the glucagon infusion had persistence of enzyme and cyclic AMP changes for at least 5 min. One child with glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency was given intravenous glucose (150 mg/kg/min) for a period of 5 min after the glucagon infusion and biopsy. The plasma insulin concentration increased from 8 to 152 muU/ml and blood glucose increased from 72 to 204 mg/100 ml. A third liver biopsy specimen was obtained immediately after the glucose infusion and showed that the glucagon-induced effects on PFK and FDPase were completely reversed. The glucagon infusion caused an increase in hepatic cyclic AMP concentration from 38 to 431 pmol/mg protein but the glucose infusion caused only a slight decrease in hepatic cyclic AMP concentration (from 431 to 384 pmol/mg protein), which did not appear to be sufficient to account for the changes in enzyme activities. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase activities were not altered by either the glucagon or the glucose infusion in any patients. Cyclic AMP (0.05 mmol/kg) was injected into the portal vein of adult rats and caused enzyme changes similar to those seen with glucagon administration in humans. Our findings suggest that rapid changes in the activities of PFK, PK, and FDPase are important in the regulation of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively, in humans and that cyclic AMP may mediate the glucagon- but probably not the glucose-insulin-induced changes in enzyme activities.
