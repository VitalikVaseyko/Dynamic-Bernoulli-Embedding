The green alga Selenastrum minutum (Naeg.) Collins is able to assimilate NH(4) (+) in the dark under anaerobic conditions (GC Vanlerberghe, AK Horsey, HG Weger, DH Turpin [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 1551-1557). In the present study, analysis of metabolites following addition of NH(4) (+) to cells acclimated to anaerobic conditions has shown the following. There was a transient decline in adenylate energy charge from 0.6 to 0.4 followed by a recovery back to ~0.6. This was accompanied by a rapid increase in pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate/fructose-6-phosphate ratios indicating activation of pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructokinase, respectively. There was also an increase in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which, since this alga lacks pyrophosphate dependent 6-phosphofructokinase can be inferred to inhibit gluconeogenic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. These changes resulted in an increase in the rate of anaerobic starch breakdown. Anaerobic NH(4) (+) assimilation also resulted in a two-fold increase in the rate of production of the major fermentative end-products in this alga, d-lactate and ethanol. There was no change in the rate of accumulation of the fermentative end product succinate but malate accumulated under anoxia during NH(4) (+) assimilation. A rapid increase in Gln and decline in Glu indicates that primary NH(4) (+) assimilation under anoxia was via glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase. Almost all N assimilated under these conditions was sequestered in alanine. These results allow us to propose a model for the regulation of carbon metabolism during anaerobic NH(4) (+) assimilation.
