Photodynamic therapy (PDT) exploits light interactions and photosensitizers to induce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) uses the phenomenon of photosensitizer emitting fluorescence to distinguish some tumors from normal tissue. The standard photosensitizer used for PDD is 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), although it is not entirely satisfactory. We previously reported glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) as a more effective photosensitizer than another widely used photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium (TS); however, G-chlorin is hydrophobic. We synthesized oligosaccharide-conjugated chlorin (O-chlorin) with improved water-solubility. We report herein on its accumulation and cytotoxicity. O-chlorin was synthesized and examined for solubility. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate O-chlorin accumulation in cancer cells. To evaluate the intracellular localization of photosensitizer, cells were stained with O-chlorin and organelle-specific fluorescent probes. We then measured the in vitro fluorescence of various photosensitizers and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations to evaluate effects in PDD and PDT, respectively. Xenograft tumor models were established, and antitumor and visibility effects were analyzed. O-chlorin was first shown to be hydrophilic. Flow cytometry then revealed a 20- to 40-times higher accumulation of O-chlorin in cancer cells than of TS, and a 7- to 23-times greater fluorescence than 5-ALA. In vitro, the cytotoxicity of O-chlorin PDT was stronger than that of TS PDT, and O-chlorin tended to accumulate in lysosomes. In vivo, O-chlorin showed the best effect in PDT and PDD compared to other photosensitizers.O-chlorin was hydrophilic and showed excellent tumor accumulation and fluorescence. O-chlorin is promising as a next-generation bifunctional photosensitizer candidate for both PDT and PDD.
