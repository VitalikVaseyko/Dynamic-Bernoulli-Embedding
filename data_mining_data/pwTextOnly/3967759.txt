Assay in the presence of 10% polyethylene glycol has been systematically used with potentially regulatory liver enzymes as an indirect way to induce aggregation of enzymes corresponding to that which could occur at their physiological concentrations. Pyruvate kinase L was markedly affected by polyethylene glycol, as was muscle phosphorylase a, while pyruvate kinase M as well as glucokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and other liver enzymes examined were not affected.
