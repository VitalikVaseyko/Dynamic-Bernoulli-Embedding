A radioimmunoassay specific for liver pyruvate kinase was used to determine the mechanism(s) involved in the insulin stimulation of this enzyme activity in chronically diabetic rats. Rats, made diabetic with alloxan, were fed on a high-carbohydrate (50%-sucrose) fat-free diet and treated with insulin for 12, 36 or 60 h. Livers were removed at the various times, a piece was kept for determination of glycogen, and the remainder was homogenized. The 100000 g supernatant was prepared and used for determination of pyruvate kinase activity and quantity. Glycogen increased to a maximum of approx. 7% by 12 h after insulin treatment, and was maintained at this elevated value for 60 h. Liver pyruvate kinase activity, which is depressed in diabetes, did not respond to insulin until 36 h of treatment, with a more substantial increase occurring by 60 h. Radioimmunoassay data indicated that the increase in activity was concomitant with a substantial increase in the quantity of the enzyme and a moderate increase in its specific activity. These results demonstrate that a dual mechanism, i.e. an increase in both the quantity and specific activity of the enzyme, regulates the insulin-mediated stimulation of liver pyruvate kinase in the diabetic rat.
