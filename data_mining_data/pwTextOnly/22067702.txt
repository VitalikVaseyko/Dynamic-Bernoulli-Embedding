The use of regular yeast (RY) and selenium-enriched yeast (SEY) as dietary supplement is of interest because the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) trial revealed that SEY but not RY decreased the incidence of prostate cancer (PC). Using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) approach, we performed proteomic analysis of RY and SEY to identify proteins that are differentially expressed as a result of selenium enrichment. 2D-DIGE revealed 96 candidate protein spots that were differentially expressed (p</=0.05) between SEY and RY. The 96 spots were selected, sequenced by LC/MS/MS and 37 proteins were unequivocally identified. The 37 identified proteins were verified with ProteinProphet software and mapped to existing Gene Ontology categories. Furthermore, the expression profile of 5 of the proteins with validated or putative roles in the carcinogenesis process, and for which antibodies against human forms of the proteins are available commercially was verified by western analysis. This study provides evidence for the first time that SEY contains higher levels of Pyruvate Kinase, HSP70, and Elongation factor 2 and lower levels of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A-2 and Triosephosphate Isomerase than those found in RY.
