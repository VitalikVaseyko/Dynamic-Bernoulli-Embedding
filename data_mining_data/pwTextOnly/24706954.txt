Broilers of the same genetic origin were classified as short or long tonic immobility duration (STI and LTI, respectively) phenotypes and treated chronically with vehicle (control) or corticosterone (CORT) dissolved in drinking water between 27 and 42 d of age. Differential expression of proteins and mRNA was examined using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR to elucidate the mechanism behind the severe retardation of broiler breast muscle growth caused by LTI and CORT. The majority of the 13 proteins found to be differentially expressed in breast muscle of STI and LTI broilers are involved in either glycolysis (5 proteins) or myofilament formation (5 proteins). Of the 16 proteins differentially expressed in breast muscle following CORT treatment, 6 are structural proteins, 5 are categorized as cellular defense and stress proteins, and 3 (pyruvate kinase, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase) are involved in responses to stress and muscle damage. Real-time PCR results indicated that expression of these proteins is transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally regulated. Protein synthesis capacity, estimated by the RNA-to-protein ratio, was significantly lower in the breast muscle of CORT-treated broilers than in untreated control broilers. The level of Leu, Gly, and Ser in serum was significantly higher in CORT-treated broilers than in the control birds. Therefore, we conclude that CORT treatment retards the growth of skeletal muscle by suppressing protein synthesis and augmenting protein catabolism, paralleling the response to severe stress and muscle damage, and the negative effect of LTI on muscle growth is likely mediated through glucose metabolism. No interaction was observed between CORT and tonic immobility affecting growth performance or any parameter examined in the current study.
