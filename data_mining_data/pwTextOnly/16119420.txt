A 7-year-old neutered male Somali cat, bred in Western Australia, was presented for investigation of jaundice and severe anaemia. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were evident on physical examination. Severe anaemia, along with leukopenia and increased liver enzymes, were present on laboratory evaluation. Clinical investigation identified cholangitis and treatment for this resolved the jaundice but failed to resolve the anaemia. Treatment for Mycoplamsa haemofelis was administered concurrently. Genetic testing was then performed and pyruvate kinase deficiency was identified, the first time this has been reported in an Australian cat. Treatment with immunosuppressive medication was not successful.
