MgATP binds both at the active site (site 1) and at a secondary site (site 2) on each monomer of muscle pyruvate kinase as previously found by binding studies and by X-ray analysis. Interproton distances on MgATP bound at each site have been measured by the time-dependent nuclear Overhauser effect in the absence and presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate), which blocks ATP binding at site 1. Interproton distances at site 2 are consistent with a single conformation of bound ATP with a high antiglycosidic torsional angle (chi = 68 +/- 10 degrees) and a C3'-endo ribose pucker (delta = 90 +/- 10 degrees). Interproton distances at site 1, determined in the absence of P-enolpyruvate by assuming the averaging of distances at both sites, cannot be fit by a single adenine-ribose conformation but require the contribution of at least three low-energy structures: 62 +/- 10% low anti (chi = 30 degrees), C3'-endo; 20 +/- 8% high anti (chi = 55 degrees), O1'-endo; and 18 +/- 8% syn (chi = 217 degrees), C2'-endo. Although a different set of ATP conformations might also have fit the interproton distances, the mixture of conformations used also fits previously determined distances from Mn2+ to the protons of ATP bound at site 1 [Sloan, D. L., & Mildvan, A. S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2412] and is similar to the adenine-ribose portion of free Co(NH3)4ATP, which consists of 35% low anti, 51% high anti, and 14% syn [Rosevear, P. R., Bramson, H. N., O'Brian, C., Kaiser, E. T., & Mildvan, A. S. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 3439].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
