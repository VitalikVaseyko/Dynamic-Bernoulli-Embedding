The fractionation of normal human erythrocytes by counter-current distribution (CCD) in charge-sensitive dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase systems was confirmed and extended to red blood cells from heterozygous beta-thalassaemic patients. The differences between the distribution profiles of normal (homogeneous) and abnormal (heterogeneous) red blood cells reflect their different surface-charge properties. As suggested by the decline of membrane sialic acid released after neuraminidase treatment and the specific activities of two age-dependent enzymes (membrane acetylcholinesterase and intracellular pyruvate kinase) in the distribution profiles (from the left- to the right-hand side fractions), the fractionation seems to be according to red blood cell age. A constancy of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level was observed in ageing red blood cells.
