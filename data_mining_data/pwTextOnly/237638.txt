Pyruvate kinase activity in gastric mucosal supernatant preparations shows large responses to exogenous effectors. At pH 7.5, fructose 1,6-diphosphate can cause large stimulations in activity. Alanine inhibits the reaction but this effect is partially reversed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. In the absence of these compounds, 4.0-5.0 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is required to generate maximal activity in the assay system used. Electrophoresis reveals an isoenzyme pattern containing only one form of pyruvate kinase, an M isoenzyme, in both fundic and antral mucosa. The pyruvate kinase of gastric mucosa thus resembles the M-type enzymes of leucocytes and liver. Measurements of activity at both 1.0 mM PEP and 4.0--5.0 mM PEP, with and without additions of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, are recommended for the reliable estimation of pyruvate kinase activity in this tissue.
