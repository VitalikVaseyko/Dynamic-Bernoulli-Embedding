In March 2012, Nobel Prize winner James Watson gave a seminar at Yale University entitled "Driven by Ideas." In his lecture, Watson discussed his personal vision for the future of science, specifically addressing how the scientific community should approach developing anticancer agents. He discussed the use of glycolytic inhibitors as anticancer agents due to the Warburg effect, as well as the benefits of metformin and anti-inflammatory drugs to help prevent cancer. He also compared drugs that target cell proliferation instead of targeting cell growth. Additionally, Watson commented on the mechanisms for how research should be conducted in the laboratory.
