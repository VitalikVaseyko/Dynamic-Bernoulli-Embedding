Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of insulin and tyrosine kinase growth factor signaling. We have recently demonstrated that PTP1B deficiency increases GLUT2/insulin receptor (IR) A complexes and glucose uptake in suckling, but not adult, primary hepatocytes. Herein we have investigated intrahepatic glucose utilization in 3-5 days old wild-type and PTP1B(-/-) mice. PTP1B deficiency decreased glycogen, lactate, and pyruvate content in the livers from suckling mice. Conversely, the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate cycle (PPC) which provides substrates for DNA synthesis, was enhanced in the liver of PTP1B(-/-) animals. Liver weight, liver-to-body mass ratio, DNA content, and PCNA expression were increased in PTP1B(-/-) suckling mice compared to the wild-type controls. At the molecular level, STAT 5B phosphorylation, IGF-I mRNA, and protein levels as well as IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation were increased in the livers of PTP1B-deficient neonates. Unexpectedly, hepatic and serum triglycerides (TG) were increased by PTP1B deficiency, although the expression of lipogenic enzymes remained as in the wild-type controls. However, the analysis of milk composition revealed higher TG content in lactating females lacking PTP1B. The effects of PTP1B deficiency on G6PD activity, STAT 5B/IGF-I/IGF-IR axis, PCNA expression and liver growth during suckling were maintained by transferring PTP1B(-/-) embryos (PTP1B(-/-T)) to a wild-type female. Conversely, PTP1B(-/-T) mice did not show hepatic fat accumulation. In conclusion, the present study suggests that PTP1B plays a unique role in the control of the physiological liver development after birth.
