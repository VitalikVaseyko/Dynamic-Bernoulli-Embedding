Pyruvatekinase (PK) isoenzymes were isolated by means of (NH4)2SO4 fractionation (20-45% and 50-70% of saturation) and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Two peaks of PK activity (I and II) were discovered under chromatography of 20-45% saturation precipitate, and one peak (I-A)-under chromatography of 50-70% saturation precipitate. PK-II in its properties (two-peaks kinetics for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the resistance to effectors) is like L-type PK, which has lost its allosteric properties in the process of long-term isolation at low temperatures. PK-I and PK-I-A have S-form kinetics for PEP. They are inhibited by L-alanine and phenylalanine, and they probably are variants of the initial K(M2) type.
