The isoenzyme composition of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK) and alanine-aminotransferase was determined in the livers of CF-1 mice exposed to 0, 5 or 10 ppm dieldrin in the diet, over a period of 14 months. This study was carried out to evaluate whether the liver tumor promoter dieldrin advances the biological age of CF-1 mouse liver. Oral dieldrin exposure induced a dose-dependent shift towards the fetal types of lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, within 1.5 months of initiation of treatment. After the initial shift, no additional dieldrin-dependent changes were found in CF-1 mouse liver throughout the experimental observation period. Thus, the initial shifts in isoenzyme composition of LDH and PK appear to reflect the adaptation of the liver to increased functional demands imposed by dieldrin treatment. The expression of the cytoplasmic A-alanine-aminotransferase isoenzyme decreased with age in untreated control mice. Dieldrin treatment enhanced this process in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that dieldrin treatment can accelerate age-dependent changes in gene expression.
