This work aims at the identification of relevant intermediate metabolism enzymes contributing to improved meat production due to genetic selection. A wild rabbit (WR) breed and a highly meat selected breed (New Zealand (NZ) rabbit) were used. Food restriction was used as an experimental condition so as to enhance differences within the metabolic pathways under study. During a period of 30 days, NZ and WR experimental breeds were subjected to, respectively, 40% and 60% ad libitum food restriction leading to 17.7% and 21.1% initial weight. Hepatic glycolytic, lipidic and protein regulatory enzyme activity, transcriptional and metabolite levels were determined. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), triiodothyronine, and cortisol were also evaluated. In the glycolytic pathways, the NZ control rabbits presented a higher phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activity level when compared to the WR, while the latter group showed a higher expression of glycogen synthase, although with less glycogen content. In the nitrogen metabolism, our results showed a lower activity level of glutamate dehydrogenase in WR when subjected to food restriction. Within the lipid metabolism, results showed that although WR had a significantly higher mRNA hepatic lipase, non-esterified fatty acid levels were similar between the experimental groups. NZ rabbits presented a better glycemia control and greater energy substrate availability leading to enhanced productivities in which triiodothyronine and IGF-1 played a relevant role.
