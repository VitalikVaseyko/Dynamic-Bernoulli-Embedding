The isomerization of 3-phospho-D-glycerate and 2-phospho-D-glycerate catalyzed by the cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase from wheat germ (the isolation and crystallization of which is described in the Appendix) has been shown to be intramolecular by two methods. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the products from the isomerization of a mixture of 3-phospho-D-[2(-2)H]glycerate and 3-[18O]phospho-D-glycerate shows that there is no exchange of labeled phosphoryl group between carbon skeletons in the mutase-catalyzed reaction. Analysis of the products from the isomerization of a mixture of 3-phospho-D-[2(-2)H]glycerate and 3-[32p]phospho-D-glycerate by a method involving the kinetic discrimination between 2(-2)H and 2(-1)H species using the enolase isotope effect similarly shows that the wheat germ phosphoglycerate mutase mediates an intramolecular transfer of the phosphoryl group.
