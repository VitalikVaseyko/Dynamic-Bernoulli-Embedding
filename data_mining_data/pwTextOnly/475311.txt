In an attempt to explain the hemolysis observed in vitamin D deficiency rickets in the infant, we studied erythrocytic glycolysis, the level of ATP and some of the key enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. This study was performed in one group of vitamin D deficient infants and in one control group. The values obtained in these two groups did not differ significantly. In the absence of a defect in the glycolytic pathway, we suggest that an anomaly exists in the red cell membrane of these patients.
