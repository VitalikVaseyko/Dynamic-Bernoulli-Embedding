Male albino rats of the Wistar strain were submitted to daily doses of 15 000 I.U. of vitamin A. Enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism were assayed in the salivary glands after 1,2, 3 and 4 doses. Phosphofructokinase showed decreased activity in the submandibular gland while it was not affected in the parotid. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was higher in the submandibular glands of all experimental groups and only in the group of 1 dose for the parotid gland. Hexokinase activity did not alter in the submandibular gland while for parotid it showed higher activity only in the group of 1 dose. Pyruvate kinase activity was different only in the group of 3 doses for both glands.
