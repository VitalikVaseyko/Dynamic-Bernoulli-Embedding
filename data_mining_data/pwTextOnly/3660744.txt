Content of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was studied in rat callus, formed in presence of commercially available preparations of placental and normal serum albumin. Total activity of all these enzymes was not similar at different stages of healing; the enzymatic activity was closely related to morpho-functional state of cellular structures in repairing zone and was dependent on their maturation. Especially pronounced changes in glycolytic enzymes activity occurred at the period of maximal proliferative activity of osteogenic cells. Placental albumin was shown to exhibit the greater stimulating effect on reparative osteogenesis as compared with the protein from blood serum.
