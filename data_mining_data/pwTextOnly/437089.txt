Experiments on 54 dogs with the use of the manometric method of Warburg proved that the level of oxidative phosphorylation in the brain cortex segments differing in the level of their phylogenic development is dissimilar. In the new cortex segment (sensomotor region) the oxygen and inorganic phosphorus uptake as well as the degree of their conjugation, as compared to the energy exchange intensity in the tissues of the old cortex (hippocampus), were found to show a higher level. Anesthetics, such as ether and sodium hexobarbital caused dissociation of the oxidative phosphorylation, more pronounced in the elements of the old cortical segments than in the new ones. The suppression of biochemical processes was especially profound under the effect of sodium hexobarbital and less marked under an ether poisoning. Hypoxia and combined action of an anesthetic and hypoxia produced inhibition of the energy exchange, more intensive in the new cortical segments.
