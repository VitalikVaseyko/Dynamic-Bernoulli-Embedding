Receptors for peptide YY (PYY) were identified in the PKSV-PCT renal proximal tubule cell line, derived from transgenic mice (SV40 large T antigen under the control of the rat L-type pyruvate kinase 5'-regulatory sequence). Binding of [125I-Tyr36]monoiodo-PYY ([125I] PYY to cell was specific, saturable, and reversible. The order of potency for peptides for inhibiting [125I]PYY binding was: PYY > neuropeptide Y (NPY) = PYY (13-36) >> pancreatic polypeptide. A single class of receptors was observed with a Kd of 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM and a Bmax of 103 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein. After cross-linking, electrophoresis of covalent [125I]PYY-receptor complexes revealed a single band of M(r) 50,000. PYY receptors were exclusively present at the basolateral membrane surface of polarized cells and were coupled negatively to adenylylcyclase by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. PKSV-PCT cell growth and T antigen expression could be modulated by D-glucose in the medium. PYY receptors were exclusively expressed in proliferative cells cultured in the presence of D-glucose. PYY receptors disappeared in the absence of D-glucose and were expressed again when proliferation was activated by reintroduction of D-glucose. PYY stimulated cell growth (17-26% increase) and promoted [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (64% increase; ED50 = 5 nM PYY) of cells grown in D-glucose-enriched medium. This latter effect of PYY was largely reversed by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. These findings suggest that PYY receptors play a role in epithelial cell growth.
