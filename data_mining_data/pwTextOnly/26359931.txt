It is well known that exercise has a major impact on substrate metabolism for many hours after exercise. However, the regulatory mechanisms increasing lipid oxidation and facilitating glycogen resynthesis in the post-exercise period are unknown. To address this, substrate oxidation was measured after prolonged exercise and during the following 6 h post-exercise in 5 -AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha2 and alpha1 knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with free access to food. Substrate oxidation was similar during exercise at the same relative intensity between genotypes. During post-exercise recovery, a lower lipid oxidation (P < 0.05) and higher glucose oxidation were observed in AMPKalpha2 KO (respiratory exchange ratio (RER) = 0.84 +/- 0.02) than in WT and AMPKalpha1 KO (average RER = 0.80 +/- 0.01) without genotype differences in muscle malonyl-CoA or free-carnitine concentrations. A similar increase in muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA expression in WT and AMPKalpha2 KO was observed following exercise, which is consistent with AMPKalpha2 deficiency not affecting the exercise-induced activation of the PDK4 transcriptional regulators HDAC4 and SIRT1. Interestingly, PDK4 protein content increased (63%, P < 0.001) in WT but remained unchanged in AMPKalpha2 KO. In accordance with the lack of increase in PDK4 protein content, lower (P < 0.01) inhibitory pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1alpha Ser(293) phosphorylation was observed in AMPKalpha2 KO muscle compared to WT. These findings indicate that AMPKalpha2 regulates muscle metabolism post-exercise through inhibition of the PDH complex and hence glucose oxidation, subsequently creating conditions for increased fatty acid oxidation.
