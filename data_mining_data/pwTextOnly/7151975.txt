The genotype difference (dystrophic vs nondystrophic) in the LDH isozymes is observed in kidney. These differences are evident only at birth and at early developmental stages (before the expression of dystrophic symptoms). The tissue specific genotype differences for PK are limited to the thigh muscle (M form) and heart (L form), after the onset of the condition. These differences may reflect the pleiotropic effect of the dy2J locus during the temporal regulation of these and other enzymes implicated in muscular dystrophy (MD).
