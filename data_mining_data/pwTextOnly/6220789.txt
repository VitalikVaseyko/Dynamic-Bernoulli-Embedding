By immunofluorescence and double labelled anti sera L and M pyruvate kinase, there is a double localization of isozymes. It is detected in basal state, in vitro, in isolated hepatocyte, in vivo in experimental or genetic (Zucker rat) hyperinsulinemia or in regenerating liver following partial hepatectomy. It is found in hepatology, in regenerative nodule of cirrhosis and in cancerous cells of liver. This double presence of L and MPK tallies with a specific double hormonodependence: induction of MPK by insulin, and inhibition of LPK by glucagon.
