AIM: To study the effect of artemether (Art) on glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) of S japanicum. METHODS: Mice infected with schistosome cercariae for 32-38 d were treated ig with Art 100-300 mg.kg-1 and killed 24-72 h after medication for collection of schistosomes. The activities of GAPDH, PGK, and PK of the worms were determined by measuring the formation of NADH or consumption of NAD. The lactate content of the worms was also measured. RESULTS: After the infected mice were treated ig with Art 300 mg.kg-1 for 24 h, the inhibition rates of GAPDH were 13% (Male) and 21% (Female), and 48 h later the inhibition rates of the enzyme were 6% (Male) and 28% (Female). When Art 300 mg.kg-1 was given to infected mice for 24 h and 48 h, the inhibition rates of PGK were 60% (Male) and 48% (Female) as well as 75% (Male) and 62% (Female), respectively. Similar results were seen in PK activity. At 72 h after treatment the reduction rate of lactate content in Female worm was 72%, while that of Male was 48%. CONCLUSION: In the glycolytic pathway of both Male and Female schistosomes, PGK and PK activities were inhibited by Art. The GAPDH activity of Female worms was also susceptible to Art, While that of Male worms showed only temporary inhibition after treatment with Art. The Art reduced lactate content more in Female than in Male worms.
