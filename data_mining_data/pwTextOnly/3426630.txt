Experimental diabetes in rats is associated with a degree of hypothyroidism. Hepatic enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were estimated in control (untreated), control +T3 treated, alloxan diabetic and alloxan diabetic + T3-treated rats. The key glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were decreased in activity in diabetes and unchanged by further treatment with T3. In contrast, certain enzymes involve in lipogenesis, ATP-citrate lyase 'malic' enzyme and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, which were decreased in activity in diabetes, were increased to, or above, control values when diabetic rats were treated with T3. It is suggested that T3 deficiency may play a role in the decrease in enzyme activities observed in experimental diabetes, in particular, some enzymes associated with lipogenesis and the provision of NADPH.
