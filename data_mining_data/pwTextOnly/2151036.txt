Two key enzymes of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were studied in embryonal carcinoma cells (P19 EC cells) and three differentiated derivatives in relation to growth rate and differentiation state. The growth rates of P19 EC cells and its differentiated derivatives are positively correlated with both the specific activity of phosphofructokinase and the expression of the L-subunit of this enzyme. The specific activity of pyruvate kinase and its isozyme composition is not correlated with growth rate but seems to be correlated with the differentiation state of these cells. The decrease in specific activity of pyruvate kinase during differentiation of P19 EC cells induced by retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide preceded the shift from K- to M-type pyruvate kinase. In contrast to aggregates that were treated with dimethylsulfoxide, the specific activity of pyruvate kinase was reduced after aggregation in the presence of retinoic acid. Only after plating dimethylsulfoxide-treated aggregates again in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide, was a decrease in specific activity obtained. Both retinoic acid and dimethylsulfoxide are able to induce a K- to -M shift of pyruvate kinase.
