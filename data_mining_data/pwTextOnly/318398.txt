1. Addition of a non-dialysable, heat-labile and acid-precipitable factor which was not absorbed on DEAE-cellulose column, could restore the sensitivity of the chromatographed muscle pyruvate kinase from Marphysa sanguinea towards phosphocreatine inhibition. 2. This factor, being non-specific as it acts on pyruvate kinase isozymes from different sources, demonstrated high creatine kinase activity. 3. High concentrations of ADP, creatine or replacement of ADP with IDP/UDP or high pH abolished the inhibition indicating that the inhibition was mediated through creatine kinase by depleting ADP. 4. Apparent inhibition of phosphocreatine was related to the relative activities of 3 intracellular enzymes--pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase and adenosine triphosphatase.
