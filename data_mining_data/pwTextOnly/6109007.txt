Polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) suppressed hepatic fatty acid synthesis and the activities of lipogenic enzymes more effectively than did saturated fats. The activity of glycolytic enzymes--glucokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase--were not affected by PUFA. The absolute rate of liver fatty acid synthesis after meal ingestion was very similar to the maximal activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase. When PUFA was supplemented to a fat-free diet, the activities of carboxylase and synthetase decreased similarly over 3 days. During the 3 days, the concentration of liver malonyl-CoA (after meal ingestion) did not significantly differ between the fat-free and PUFA dietary treatments. Apparently PUFA feeding caused a coordinate decrease in the utilization and production of malonyl-CoA which resulted in no net change in malonyl-CoA pool size. Thus the mechanism by which PUFA suppresses fatty acid synthesis appears to be by coordinately and specifically reducing the amount of carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase.
