The expression of specific and non-specific rat liver messenger RNAs has been studied during 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene (3'-MeDAB) carcinogenesis, using cDNA probes complementary to mRNAs encoding aldolase A and B, L-type pyruvate kinase, albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, transferrin and an unidentified 2.7 X 10(3)-base mRNA. mRNAs specific for undifferentiated cells, such as those encoding aldolase A and the unidentified 2.7 X 10(3)-base species were re-expressed very early, being easily detectable at the 1st week of 3'-MeDAB treatment. They reached a maximum of expression at the 4th week. Simultaneously the levels of aldolase B and L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs dramatically decreased as compared to controls, but remained responsive to induction by a high-carbohydrate diet. Albumin and transferrin mRNA levels were only slightly modified in the course of the carcinogenic diet. At the terminal stage of hepatocarcinogenesis, i.e. in malignant hepatoma cells, expression and inducibility of aldolase B and L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were similar to those in normal adult rats while mRNAs specific for undifferentiated or foetal stages were also synthesized. The very early changes in gene expression for aldolases A and B, L-type pyruvate kinase and the 2.7 X 10(3)-base mRNA species could indicate that carcinogenic diet modifies gene control mechanisms long before inducing hepatoma.
