In this study, it is found that, for Bacillus subtilis, citrate-glucose cometabolism leads to zero acid production over a wide range of growth rates and nearly theoretical carbon yield. Experimental results are presented that point to pyruvate kinase (PYK) as a site of citrate-mediated glycolytic flux attenuation. First, the measured fluxes show that, compared with cultures grown on glucose, the PYK flux drops by more than tenfold when citrate is added. Second, relative to cultures metabolizing glucose, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool elevates substantially, whereas the pyruvate pool drops, when citrate is present. Finally, our modeling results indicate that maximizing carbon yield corresponds to nearly eliminating pyruvate kinase (PYK) flux and that the pyruvate supplied by the PEP-consuming glucose transport system can supply the biosynthetic requirements. A literature review suggests some mechanisms for how PYK attenuation by citrate addition can occur. At this juncture, we hypothesize that direct PYK inhibition occurs which, in turn, also leads to phosphofructokinase inhibition via the elevated PEP pool. These two inhibition events combine to throttle glycolytic flux; minimize acid formation; and substantially increase cellular, product, and energetic yields.
