A decreased intracellular pH of exocrine glands could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Metabolic acidosis was induced in rats by adding ammonium chloride to the drinking water. An increased content of both total proteins and glycoproteins was found in the submandibular glands of the treated animals. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes - hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase - were also increased in these glands, whereas the activity of creatine phosphokinase was unchanged. The changes of protein concentration and enzyme activities in the submandibular gland of acidotic rats agree with findings in patients with cystic fibrosis and cultured fibroblasts from these patients. The acidotic rat might be a new promising animal model for cystic fibrosis research. The finding of increased enzyme activities in acidotic rats is, however, contrary to findings in other animal models of the disease.
