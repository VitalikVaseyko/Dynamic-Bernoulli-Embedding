In this research on metabolic effects of a high fructose diet, we studied the duration of these effects by measuring the specific activity of 8 enzymes stimulated by such a diet, on days, 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, after the return to a normal diet. In the intestinal mucosa, ketohexokinase, aldolase, triokinase, fructose-diphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase specific activities were still entirely or partially stimulated on the 15th day after return to the standard diet. The stimulation of glucose-6-phosphatase and pyruvate kinase specific activities stopped quickly. In the liver, with the exception of fructose-diphosphatase, the return to basic values was much quicker than in intestine. In 7 enzymes out of 8 it was realized in 9 days or less. When a high fructose diet gives way to a normal one, return to basic values comes so much the quicker as activation has needed longer to appear.
