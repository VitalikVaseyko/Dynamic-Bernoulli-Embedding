There is a growing appreciation of the beneficial attributes of allosteric drugs. However, the development of this special class of drugs has in large part been via serendipitous findings from high-throughput screens of drug libraries. Limited success at deliberately identifying allosteric drugs may be due to a focus on enzyme inhibitors, a parallel to the historic focus on competitive inhibitors. In contrast to inhibition, activation of an enzyme by a small molecule can only occur through a limited number of mechanisms, mainly allosteric regulation. Activation of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) in an effort to create a glycolytic/gluconeogenic futile cycle is one potential mechanism to counteract hyperglycemia. Using hL-PYK, we demonstrate the potential of drug library screens to identify allosteric-activator drug leads.
