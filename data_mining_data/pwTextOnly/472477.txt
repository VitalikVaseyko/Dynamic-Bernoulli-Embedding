The effects of blood sampling from the ear vein, jugular vein and collection on exsanguination, on serum CK, LDH, GOT and PK activities were investigated. The activities of LDH and PK were higher in ear vein vena cava samples. The effect of pre-slaughter handling was also investigated. In general there was a significant progressive increase in serum enzyme activities from farm to slaughter, although the magnitude of the change varied for different enzymes.
