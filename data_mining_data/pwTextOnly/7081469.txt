The physiological effect of chronic exposure to altitude hypoxia on the glycolytic intermediates, adenosine triphosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, and the hematologic parameters, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration, has been examined in an indigenous population, the Aymara, of the Departamento de Arica, Chile. This population normally resides at three altitudes: the coast (0-500 m), the sierra (2,500-3,500 m), and the altiplano (above 4,200 m). After isolation of altitude from other environmental factors (age, sex, body build, ethnicity, smoking, and residential permanence), an increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a decrease in adenosine triphosphate was observed. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit increased as expected, but mean cell hemoglobin concentration declined. It is proposed that a decline in the activity of a single enzyme, pyruvate kinase, can account for these observed changes and suggests a pivotal role for pyruvate kinase in the physiological adaptation to altitude hypoxia.
