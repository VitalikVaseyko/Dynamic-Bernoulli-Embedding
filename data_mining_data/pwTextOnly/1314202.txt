Vanadate and insulin were administered to diabetic (streptozotocin) rats to compare their effects on the activity and mRNA content of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and L-type pyruvate kinase in the liver. The activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase in livers of diabetic rats was about 40% of that found in normal rats. A similar decrease was found for 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase content, measured by immunoprecipitation, and for mRNA, measured by hybridization of Northern blots. Administration of vanadate to the diabetic rats led to a progressive recovery of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- 2,6-bisphosphatase content and mRNA. This recovery, which was complete after 15 days of oral treatment, was also obtained after 60 h of insulin administration. L-type pyruvate kinase activity and mRNA were also decreased by about 70% in livers of diabetic rats. Both parameters normalized after 15 days of vanadate treatment, whereas insulin administration (60 h) raised L-pyruvate kinase mRNA three-fold above control values. Oral treatment for 15 days with vanadate can thus mimic the effect of insulin on both pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6- bisphosphatase in livers of diabetic rats.
