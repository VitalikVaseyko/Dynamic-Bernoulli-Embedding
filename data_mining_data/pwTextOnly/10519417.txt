Here, we investigated changes in apoptosis during tumor progression by analyzing the effect of coexpressing various antiapoptotic genes on the multistage process of c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in transgenic mice. Whereas continuous c-myc gene overexpression in the liver led to cellular hepatocarcinoma, the coexpression of the bcl-2 gene inhibited the emergence of liver tumors, by inhibiting a pretumoral phase characterized by increased proliferation and apoptosis. This antioncogenic effect was specific to Bcl-2 and was not shared by other antiapoptotic genes such as bcl-xL and a dominant negative form of p53. Thus, we have shown that Bcl-2 can have a tumor suppressor effect in vivo on c-myc-induced hepatocarcinogenesis during the emergence of neoplastic foci.
