We produced three lines of transgenic mice containing the 5' flanking region of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene from nucleotides -189 to +37, which includes an enhancer unit and TATA box as functional elements, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Since transgene expression was stimulated by both dietary fructose and glucose in a tissue-dependent manner, we suggest that this unit is responsive to both stimuli.
