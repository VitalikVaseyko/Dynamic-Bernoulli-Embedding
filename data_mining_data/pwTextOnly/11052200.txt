Alterations in gene expression during early stages of dormancy release in grapevine buds were analyzed to facilitate the identification of gene products that may mediate the signal transduction of a dormancy-release signal, or derepression of meristematic activity. In the present report we describe the identification of GDBRPK, a transcript for an SNF-like protein kinase that is up-regulated upon chemical induction of dormancy release by hydrogen cyanamide (HC). Since SNF and SNF-like protein kinases are known as sensors of stress signals, we hypothesize that GDBRPK may be involved in the perception of a stress signal induced by HC. We also describe a simultaneous and remarkable induction of both PDC and ADH transcripts that was observed shortly after HC application, and was of a transient nature. These data may imply that HC application leads to a transient respiratory stress, which likely results in a temporary increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. Since AMP is known as a stress signal that is sensed by SNF-like kinases, we suggest that the SNF-like GDBRPK could serve as the sensor of this signal.
