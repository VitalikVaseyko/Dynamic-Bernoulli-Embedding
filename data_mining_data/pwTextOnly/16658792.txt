Increasing levels of CO(2) have been shown to stimulate the rate of photosynthesis, eliminate the oxygen inhibition of photosynthesis (Warburg effect), and decrease glycolate formation in isolated spinach chloroplasts. Ribose 5-phosphate and fructose 1,6-diphosphate at concentrations of 5 to 10 mum also stimulate the rate of plastid photosynthesis and eliminate the Warburg effect. In contrast to the effect of high CO(2) levels, these sugar phosphates have little effect on glycolate formation. Evidence is presented to show that the level of intermediates of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle may influence the Warburg effect in vivo. It is postulated that the formation of glycolate is not the causal factor of the Warburg effect.
