The carcinogenic urethane (URTH), dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), benzo[a]pyrene (BP), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and aflatoxin B1 (B1) administered to pregnant CFLP mice increased the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and decreased the ratio of LDH H and M subunits in the lungs of offsprings. However, under the same conditions, the non-carcinogenic phenylurethane (PHUR), ethylformate (EF), chrysene (CHRY), perylene (PER) and pyrene (PYR), as well as the toxic Paraquat (PAR), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and cadmium chloride (CdCl2), did not influence the activities of the enzymes tested.
