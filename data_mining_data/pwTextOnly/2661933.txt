It is well established that caloric restriction extends life span and significantly retards the rate of occurrence of most age-associated degenerative disease processes. A paucity of data exists relative to the mechanisms by which caloric restriction accomplishes these events. We have examined the effect of caloric restriction in rats on several hepatic enzymes of intermediary metabolism. The activities of glycolytic and supporting enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were all decreased in response to caloric restriction. Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase and creatine phosphokinase were not altered. Likewise, enzymes associated with lipid metabolism (malic enzyme and glycerokinase) were reduced (fatty acid synthetase was reduced, but not to a statistically significant degree). Activities of enzymes supporting gluconeogenesis (glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, tyrosine aminotransferase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, amino acid oxidase, malate dehydrogenase, and glucose 6-phosphatase) were either unchanged or increased significantly by caloric restriction. Glucagon levels were decreased. Comparisons between young ad libitum fed and older calorically restricted rats revealed similar but not identical metabolic activity. These results suggest that caloric restriction produces an effect on intermediary metabolism, favoring the role of glucagon and glucose synthesis; but limiting the role of insulin and glucose catabolism in the liver. The former observation provides for the efficient support of peripheral tissues and the latter a level of energy production necessary only for self maintenance. Limited lipid metabolism suggests decreased potential for fatty acid epoxide formation and free radical damage to cellular macromolecules. Additionally, caloric restriction may delay the progressive age associated changes in the activities of some of the enzymes investigated.
