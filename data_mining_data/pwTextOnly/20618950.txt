BACKGROUND: During and following myocardial ischemia, glucose oxidation rates are low and fatty acids dominate as a source of oxidative metabolism. This metabolic phenotype is associated with contractile dysfunction during reperfusion. To determine the mechanism of this reliance on fatty acid oxidation as a source of ATP generation, a functional proteomics approach was utilized. RESULTS: 2-D gel electrophoresis of mitochondria from working rat hearts subjected to 25 minutes of global no flow ischemia followed by 40 minutes of aerobic reperfusion identified 32 changes in protein abundance compared to aerobic controls. Of the five proteins with the greatest change in abundance, two were increased (long chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (48 +/- 1 versus 39 +/- 3 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05) and alpha subunit of ATP synthase (189 +/- 15 versus 113 +/- 23 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05)), while two were decreased (24 kDa subunit of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (94 +/- 7 versus 127 +/- 9 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 0.05) and D subunit of ATP synthase (230 +/- 11 versus 368 +/- 47 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 05)). Two forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase betaE1 subunit, the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose oxidation, were also identified. The protein level of the more acidic form of pyruvate dehydrogenase was reduced during reperfusion (37 +/- 4 versus 56 +/- 7 arbitrary units, n = 3, P < 05), while the more basic form remained unchanged. The more acidic isoform was found to be O-palmitoylated, while both isoforms exhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced phosphorylation. In silico analysis identified the putative kinases as the insulin receptor kinase for the more basic form and protein kinase Czeta or protein kinase A for the more acidic form. These modifications of pyruvate dehydrogenase are associated with a 35% decrease in glucose oxidation during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion induces significant changes to a number of metabolic proteins of the mitochondrial proteome. In particular, ischemia/reperfusion induced the post-translational modification of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting step of glucose oxidation, which is associated with a 35% decrease in glucose oxidation during reperfusion. Therefore these post-translational modifications may have important implications in the regulation of myocardial energy metabolism.
