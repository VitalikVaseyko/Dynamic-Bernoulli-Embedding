The objective was to determine the possible links between the expression levels of genes involved in alternative glycolytic pathways, phosphorus (P) scavenging and recycling and Citrus tolerance to aluminum (Al) and/or P-deficiency. 'Xuegan' (Citrus sinensis) and 'Sour pummelo' (Citrus grandis) seedlings were irrigated for 18 weeks with nutrient solution containing 0 and 1.2 mM AlCl(3).6H(2)O x 0, 50 and 200 muM KH(2)PO(4). C. sinensis displayed more tolerant to Al and P-deficiency than C. grandis. Under Al stress, C. sinensis accumulated more Al in roots and less Al in shoots than C. grandis. P concentration was higher in C. sinensis shoots and roots than in C. grandis ones. C. sinensis roots secreted more malate and citrate than C. grandis ones when exposed to Al. Al-induced-secretion of malate and citrate by excised roots from Al-treated seedlings decreased with increasing P supply. Al-induced-secretion of malate and citrate from roots and Al precipitation by P in roots might be responsible for Al-tolerance of C. sinensis. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1), ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK), pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK), tonoplast adenosine-triphosphatase subunit A (V-ATPase A), tonoplast pyrophosphatase (V-PPiase), pyruvate kinase (PK), acid phosphatase (APase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malic enzyme (ME) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) genes might contribute to the tolerance of Citrus to Al and/or P-deficiency, but any single gene could not explain the differences between the two species. Citrus tolerance to Al and/or P-deficiency might be caused by the coordinated regulation of gene expression involved in alternative glycolytic pathways, P scavenging and recycling.
