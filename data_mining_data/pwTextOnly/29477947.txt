BACKGROUND: Pyruvate improves contractility of normal, hypoxic, and post-ischemic myocardium. However, sodium overload is a major problem with its therapeutic application if sodium pyruvate is used. Development of alternative forms such as N-1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) pyruvate may help to overcome this problem. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of MNA pyruvate in a murine model of cardiac ischemia. METHODS: Seven month old male ApoE(-/-)LDLr(-/-) mice that develop myocardial infarction when exposed to hypoxic stress, were used in this study. Hypoxia (8% O2 in inspired air) was maintained for 8min and was followed by reoxygenation (21% O2 in inspired air). Four groups of mice were treated 10min before the hypoxic event by intravenous injection of MNA, MNA pyruvate, sodium pyruvate, and saline as control. The myocardial ischemia and damage was recorded by ECG. Four hours following the hypoxic episode serum troponin T and creatine kinase activity were measured. RESULTS: Significant hypernatremia was found in the sodium pyruvate group. During hypoxia, control and MNA group developed profound STU depressions on ECG while no changes were observed in MNA pyruvate and sodium pyruvate group. Creatine kinase activity and troponin T content in the mice plasma were significantly higher in the control and MNA group as compared to the MNA pyruvate and sodium pyruvate group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that administration of MNA pyruvate prior to a hypoxia-induced cardiac event was cardioprotective. This intervention did not cause hypernatremia in contrast to sodium pyruvate.
