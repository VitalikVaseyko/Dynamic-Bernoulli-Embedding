Englitazone (CP 68,722, Pfizer) is a member of a family of drugs known as thiazolidinediones. One member of this family, troglitazone (Rezulin), is currently utilized in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have focused on the ability of englitazone to increase insulin sensitivity in various tissues. However, little information is available regarding the direct effect of englitazone on hepatic glucose metabolism in the absence of insulin. Therefore, the following studies were conducted to comparatively evaluate the effect of englitazone and glyburide (a representative sulfonylurea) on gluconeogenesis and glycolysis from various substrates in the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL). In isolated perfused rat livers of 24-hr fasted rats infused with lactate (2 mM), englitazone (6.25 to 50 microM) produced a concentration-dependent decrease (32-93%) in hepatic gluconeogenesis. When dihydroxyacetone (1 mM) and fructose (1 mM) were used as metabolic substrates, englitazone inhibited gluconeogenesis by 31 and 15%, respectively, while increasing glycolysis by 42 and 50%. Similar effects on gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were observed with glyburide, even though the effects with glyburide were more acutely evident, reversible, and of a greater magnitude. Such data suggest alterations in hepatic glucose production may contribute to the decrease in plasma glucose concentrations observed in individuals treated with englitazone and glyburide. These alterations may include effects on several regulatory enzymes (e.g. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), which warrant further investigation.
