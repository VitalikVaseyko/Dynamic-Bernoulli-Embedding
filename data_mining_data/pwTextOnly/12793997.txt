Brown adipose tissue (BAT) glyceroneogenesis was evaluated in rats either fasted for 48 h or with streptozotocin-diabetes induced 3 days previously or adapted for 20 days to a high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet, conditions in which BAT glucose utilization is reduced. The three treatments induced an increase in BAT glyceroneogenic activity, evidenced by increased rates of incorporation of [1-14C]pyruvate into triacylglycerol (TAG)-glycerol in vitro and a marked, threefold increase in the activity of BAT phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). BAT glycerokinase activity was not significantly affected by fasting or diabetes. After unilateral BAT denervation of rats fed either the HP or a balanced diet, glyceroneogenesis activity increased in denervated pads, evidenced by increased rates of nonglucose carbon incorporation into TAG-glycerol in vivo (difference between 3H2O and [14C]glucose incorporations) and of [1-14C]pyruvate in vitro. PEPCK activity was not significantly affected by denervation. The data suggest that BAT glyceroneogenesis is not under sympathetic control but is sensitive to hormonal/metabolic factors. In situations of reduced glucose use there is an increase in BAT glyceroneogenesis that may compensate the decreased generation of glycerol-3-phosphate from the hexose.
