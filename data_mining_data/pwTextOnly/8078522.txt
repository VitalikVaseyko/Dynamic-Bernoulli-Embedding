Leishmania mexicana mexicana contains two tandemly arranged genes for pyruvate kinase (PYK). The 5' located gene codes for a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 54,370. The calculated net charge and isoelectric point of the polypeptide are -6 and 6.5, respectively. Its amino-acid sequence is 73.7% identical to that of the Trypanosoma brucei PYK and 46.4-49.8% to the enzyme of mammalian cells. The second gene appears not to be functional, because its 5' and 3' extremities have undergone recombinations. L. m. mexicana PYK has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, using a T7 expression system. Approximately 30% of the protein was detected in the soluble cell fraction. It has been highly purified by chromatography over DEAE-Sephacel and Affigel Blue. From a 1-1 culture 6 mg enzyme was obtained with a specific activity of 224 units mg-1. The protein has a subunit molecular mass of 59,000, as determined by SDS/PAGE, and an isoelectric point of 5.9. Some kinetic properties of the enzyme have been measured and compared with those reported for the T. brucei enzyme. The kinetics of both enzymes are very similar, the most important aspect being their activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Nevertheless, some differences were observed; the T. brucei enzyme is activated by the effector in a cooperative manner, whereas the activation of the L. m. mexicana enzyme is not cooperative.
