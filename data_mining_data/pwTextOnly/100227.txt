Changes in the activity of 3 enzymes--lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble malate dehydrogenase (sMDH), and pyruvate kinase (PK)--in homogenates of larval salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster were studied before and after the induction of heat sensitive puffs with trinactin. The activities of 2 enzymes (LDH and sMDH) were enhanced after puff induction, an effect that was abolished in the presence of cycloheximide. Pyruvate kinase activity did not change after puff induction. The results indicate a relation between the increase of LDH and sMDH activity due to de novo synthesis and the induction of heat sensitive puffs.
