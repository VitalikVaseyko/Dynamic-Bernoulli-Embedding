Self-rooted, 10-month-old, uniform tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Huangguanyin] plants were supplied for 17 weeks with 0, 40, 80, 160, 400, or 1000muM phosphorus (P) to investigate the effects of P supply on root citrate and malate release, the concentrations of malate and citrate and the activities of acid-metabolizing enzymes in leaves and roots. Root malate release and accumulation was induced by both 0 and 40muM P, while root citrate release and accumulation was induced only by 0muM P. Phosphorus-deficiency-induced malate and citrate release coincided with higher concentrations of root malate and citrate. The higher concentrations of malate and citrate were accompanied by increased activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase (PEPP), citrate synthase (CS) and NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) and decreased activities of pyruvate kinase (PK), NADP-ME and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH) in roots. In contrast to roots, malate accumulated in the leaves only in response to 0muM P, and no change was observed in citrate levels. The P-deficiency-induced leaf malate accumulation coincided with increased activities of NADP-ME, NAD-ME and PK. Overall, the P-deficiency-induced changes in organic acid (OA) metabolism differed between roots and leaves. The high tolerance of tea plants to P-deficiency might be involved in two major processes: (a) increasing the availability of P by inducing root release of OA anions; and (b) improving the ability to use P efficiently by inducing bypass enzymes involved in tissue P economy.
