The differences in therapeutic effectiveness between sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and continuous blood purification (CBP) were investigated. In order to assess the different treatment methods, 56 critically ill patients were divided into two groups, the CBP group and the SLED group. A comparison was made between all the biochemical indicators, in-hospital duration, hemodynamic parameters, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE-II), the survival, and the mortality rates. After treatment, the levels of serum creatine kinase isozyme MB (CK-MB), creatine kinase, creatinine, glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (AST), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (ALT), APACHE II score on the 1st, 2nd, and 7th day in both the treatment groups were lower than that before the treatment (P < 0.05). There are no statistical differences in in-hospital duration, biochemical indicators, APACHE II score, hemodynamic parameters, the survival rate and the mortality rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). It was concluded that SLED has similar hemodynamic stability with CBP and the two methods have similar treatment effects in critically ill patients. However, we noticed that SLED can be relatively economical and convenient for critically ill patients in clinical practice.
