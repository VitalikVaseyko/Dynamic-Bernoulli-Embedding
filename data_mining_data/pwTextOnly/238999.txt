Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase catalyzes the hydrolysis of P-enolpyruvate at the same active site which catalyzes the physiologically important kinase reaction. The hydrolase activity is lower than the kinase activity by a factor of at least 10(3). There are specific monovalent cation and divalent cation requirements. No other cofactors are required. The relative activation of the pyruvate kinase for the hydrolase reaction is: Ni(II) greater than Co(II) greater than Mg(II) greater than Mn(II). This parallels the rates of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of P-enolpyruvate (Benkovic, S.J., and Schray, K.J. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 4097-4102). The pH rate profiles of the hydrolase and kinase reactions activated by Ni(II) and Co(II) are similar, suggesting common features in their mechanisms. In contrast to the kinase reaction, the reaction velocity of the hydrolase increases at high Co(II) concentrations indicating a second mode for hydrolysis.
