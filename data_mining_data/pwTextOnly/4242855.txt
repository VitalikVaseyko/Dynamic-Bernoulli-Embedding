1. Measurements were made of the activities of nine glycolytic enzymes in epididymal adipose tissues obtained from rats that had undergone one of the following treatments: starvation; starvation followed by re-feeding with bread or high-fat diet; feeding with fat without preliminary starvation; alloxan-diabetes; alloxan-diabetes followed by insulin therapy. 2. In general, the activities of the glycolytic enzymes of adipose tissue, unlike those of liver, were not greatly affected by the above treatments. 3. The ;key' glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were generally no more adaptive in response to physiological factors than other glycolytic enzymes such as glucose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. 4. Adiposetissue pyruvate kinase did not respond to feeding with fat in a manner similar to the liver enzyme. 5. Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase had a behaviour pattern unlike the other eight glycolytic enzymes studied in that its activity was depressed by feeding with fat and was not restored to normal by re-feeding with a high-fat diet after starvation. These results are discussed in relation to the requirements of adipose tissue for glycerol phosphate in the esterification of fatty acids. 6. A statistical analysis of the results permitted the writing of linear equations describing the relationships between the activities of eight of the enzymes studied. 7. Evidence is presented for the existence of two constant-proportion groups amongst the enzymes studied, namely (i) glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and (ii) triose phosphate isomerase, fructose diphosphate aldolase and pyruvate kinase. 8. Mechanisms for maintaining the observed relationships between the activities of the enzymes in the tissue are discussed.
