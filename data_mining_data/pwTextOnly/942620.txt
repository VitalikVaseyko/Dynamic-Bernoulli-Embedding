Amino-terminal analysis of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) failed to detect the presence of any free amino-terminal residues. Acetyl group analysis demonstrated the presence of between 3.7 and 4.0 mol of acetyl groups per mol of enzyme. The acetylated amino-terminal residue was isolated from pronase digests of the enzyme and identified as N-acetylserine. Quantitative recovery experiments indicated that all acetyl residues are found at the amino termini. Carboxyl-terminal analyses using the tritium exchange method suggested the presence of a blocked carboxyl-terminal residue, supporting previous hydrazinolysis and carboxypeptidase studies.
