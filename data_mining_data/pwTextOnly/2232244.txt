The basic and clinical studies that are expected to influence future laboratory medicine were presented by five speakers in the symposium held at the National Cardiovascular Center, in Osaka on January 27, 1990. Dr. Y. Katayama reported a new method for analyzing glycated protein by HPLC and the data on the positive error caused by superoxide anion in the value of fructosamine. Dr. Y. Harano described a sensitive method for enzyme immunoassay of apoprotein B and discussed cases of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and hypo-apoprotein B with respect to the apoprotein B level. Dr. T. Noguchi reported the excellent results in DNA analysis of pyruvate kinase. Dr. N. Taniguchi presented a basic study on superoxide dismutase and noted the increased activity of this enzyme in certain diseases. The assay of this enzyme activity can now be routinely performed. Dr. H. Matsuo, the last speaker in this symposium, had received the Gakusiin award in 1989 for his studies on atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH). He outlined the history of ANH study developed in his laboratory. ANH also will be added to routine assay. We, the chairmen in this symposium, added comments concerning useful modern techniques for the clinical chemistry and the role of the clinical laboratory in large hospitals.
