Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumour. Increasing evidence has demonstrated the pathogenic role of microRNA (miRNAs) dysregulation in tumour development. miR-379 was previously reported to function as an oncogenic or tumour-suppressing miRNA in a tissue-dependent manner. However, its function in osteosarcoma remains unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-379 was downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Further functional characterization revealed that miR-379 suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and retarded the growth of osteosarcoma xenografts in vivo. Mechanistically, PDK1 was identified as the direct target of miR-379 in osteosarcoma, in which PDK1 expression was up-regulated and showed inverse correlation with miR-379. Enforced expression of PDK1 promoted osteosarcoma cell proliferation and rescued the anti-proliferative effect of miR-379. These data suggest that miR-379 could function as a tumour-suppressing miRNA via targeting PDK1 in osteosarcoma.
