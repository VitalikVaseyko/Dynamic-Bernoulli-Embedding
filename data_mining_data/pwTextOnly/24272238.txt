Interaction of pyruvate kinase with membrane fractions of rat brain homogenates was shown to be electrostatic. Ionic compounds readily solubilized the enzyme from membranes, and the enzyme was more readily solubilized at high pH versus low pH. Developmental patterns indicated that the particulate and soluble forms of pyruvate kinase increased nearly in synchrony from birth until maturity.
