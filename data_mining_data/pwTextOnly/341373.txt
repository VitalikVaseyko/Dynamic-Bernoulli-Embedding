Concordant segregation of the expression of the alpha subunit of human hexosaminidase A, human mannosephosphate isomerase, and pyruvate kinase was observed in somatic cell hybrids between either thymidine kinase-deficient mouse cells or thymidine kinase-deficient Chinese hamster cells and human white blood cells carrying a translocation of the distal half (q 22-qter) of the long arm of chromosome 15 to chromosome 17. A positive correlation was established between the expression of these human phenotypes and the presence of the distal half of the long arm of human chromosome 15.
