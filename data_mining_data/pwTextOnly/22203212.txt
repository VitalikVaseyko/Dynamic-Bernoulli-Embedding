An increase in oleic acid (C18:1) content is a desirable trait. Despite the critical roles of the two desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3, in the control of fatty acid desaturation, a dispute remains over whether inactivation of their genes alone is sufficient enough to generate the high-oleic trait. To address this question, we employed microarray technology to investigate the difference in gene expression profile between two different Brassica napus strains with high-C18:1 (71.71%) and low-C18:1 (55.6%) contents, respectively. Our study revealed 562 differentially expressed genes, of which 194 genes were up-regulated and 368 down-regulated. Based on the Gene Ontology classification, these genes were classified into 23 functional categories. Three of the up-regulated genes represent B. napus homologs of Arabidopsis genes encoding a cytosolic isoform of pyruvate kinase (AT3G55810), Delta9 acyl-lipid desaturase (AT1G06080, ADS1) and fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase B (AT1G08510), respectively. Conversely, the homologs of two Arabidopsis sequences encoding Delta9 acyl-lipid desaturase (AT2G31360, ADS2) and FAD3 desaturase (AT2G29980) were down-regulated in the high-oleic acid strain. Furthermore, 60 differentially expressed genes were classified as associated with relevant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that expressing the high-oleic acid trait may require a coordinated regulation of diverse regulatory and metabolic gene networks in addition to inactivation of the FAD2 and FAD3 genes in the oilseed. A set of the differentially expressed genes identified in this study will facilitate our efforts to tap the germplasms with the potential to express the high-oleic acid trait.
