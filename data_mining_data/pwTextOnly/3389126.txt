Determinations of erythrocyte enzyme scavengers of oxygen radicals (glutathione-peroxidase, superoxide-dismutase and catalase) and determinations of erythrocyte age-dependent glycolytic activities (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, pyruvate-kinase and glucose-phosphate-isomerase) were carried out in cord blood and in the blood taken on the 4th day of life in 152 newborn infants with different peak bilirubin levels. The enzyme activities scavenging oxygen radicals, glutathione-peroxidase and superoxide-dismutase were significantly lower in infants with peak bilirubinemia higher than 214 mumol/l, compared to less-jaundiced neonates, both at birth and on the 4th day of life; their values correlated negatively with peak bilirubinemia at birth and on the 4th day of life. Glycolytic age-dependent enzyme activities were significantly higher in more jaundiced newborn infants only on the 4th day of life, when their values correlated positively with peak bilirubinemia. The results of this investigation suggest that a deficiency of factors protecting from oxygen toxicity, may play a role in the development of neonatal hemolysis and jaundice.
