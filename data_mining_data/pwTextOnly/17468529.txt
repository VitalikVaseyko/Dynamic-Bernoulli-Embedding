Severe hypertriglyceridemia has been observed in infants with beta-thalassemia major, an association termed hypertriglyceridemia-thalassemia syndrome. The pathophysiological basis for this association has remained unclear. We describe 6-month-old American girl with red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, failure to thrive, and marked hypertriglyceridemia (=1500 mg/dL). The hyperlipidemia resolved with hypertransfusion therapy. At age 18 months she underwent a splenectomy and has remained transfusion-independent with normal serum triglyceride levels. We suggest that severe hemolysis and chronic wasting are probably responsible for the hypertriglyceridemia seen in infants with thalassemia or PK deficiency.
