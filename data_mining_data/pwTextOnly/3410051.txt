The pyruvate kinase isozymes M1 and M2 are structurally and immunologically closely related. To obtain an antibody which discriminates between these two forms, a synthetic tetradecapeptide with a sequence specific for pyruvate kinase type M2 from rats was constructed. Antisera from rabbits, immunized with this peptide, reacted specifically with the M2-type holoenzyme of both rat and human origin, and did not cross-react with the M1-type isozyme. This was established by immunoblot analysis, both under dissociating and non-dissociating conditions.
