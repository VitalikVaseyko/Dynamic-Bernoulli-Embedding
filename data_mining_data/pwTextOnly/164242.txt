1) The activities of 16 enzymes of glycolysis and of glutathione metabolism were determined in intact human red cell membranes (ghosts) which were prepared by hypotonic hemolysis. 2) Enzymes and hemoglobin of the ghosts were resolved by two toluene extractions. Only the four enzymes hexokinase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase could not be released completely from the ghosts. 3) The residual membrane fraction, which was obtained after the toluene extraction of ghosts prepared at 30 imOsM, contained 0.02% of the original hemoglobin content of the red cell. Between 6.5 and 23% of the hemolysate activities of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were detected in this fraction after mechanical disruption. 4) Sonication of intact ghosts increased the activities of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase. 5) In "white" ghosts prepared at 5 imOsM phosphate buffer which contained 0.5% of the original hemoglobin the activities of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase were detected at high levels. The activities of pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase were low in these preparations. 6) The results indicate that one part of all enzymes is loosely attached to the inner surface of the membrane as is hemoglobin. A second part, the "cryptic enzyme activity", is available after resolving by toluene. A residual part of four enzymes is firmly bound to the membrane. Two of them (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase) are oriented toward the inner surface of the membrane, whereas pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate kinase are hidden in the lipid core of the membrane.
