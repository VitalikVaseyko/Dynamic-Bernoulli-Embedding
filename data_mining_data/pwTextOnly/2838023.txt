In order to detect covalent reaction intermediates in the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase reaction, we have investigated the interaction of EPSP synthase with the reaction product EPSP. An exchange of EPSP-methylene protons could be demonstrated by incubating EPSPS with EPSP in D2O. Since trace amounts of contaminating Pi would lead to reversal of EPSPS reaction and hence methylene proton exchange, we added pyruvate kinase, ADP, Mg++ and K+. Under these conditions, any contaminating Pi that is converted to PEP is trapped as ATP. No exchange of EPSP protons with those of the solvent could be detected in the presence of this trap system, suggesting that enzyme-bound EPSP is unable to form a covalent tetrahedral complex. Incorporation of [14C] from [14C]-S3P and [14C]-PEP into EPSP could be detected, but only in the absence of a PEP (or Pi) trap system. This indicates that for the exchange reaction, Pi is required, and also indicates the absence of a covalent intermediate, unless the carboxyvinyl-enzyme-bound S3P is completely restricted from exchange.
