OBJECTIVE: To identify the interacting proteins with S100A8 or S100A9 in HEK293 cell line by flag-tag affinity purification and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Methods: The p3xFlag-CMV-S100A8 and p3xFlag-CMV-S100A9 expression vectors were constructed by inserting S100A8 or S100A9 coding sequence. The recombinant plasmids were then transfected into HEK293 cells. Affinity purification and LC-MS/MS were applied to identify the proteins interacting with S100A8 or S100A9. Bioinformatics analysis was used to seek the gene ontology of the interacting proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was applied to confirm the proteins interacted with S100A8 or S100A9. Results: Fourteen proteins including pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), nucleophosmin (NPM1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), which potentially interacted with S100A8, were successfully identified by Flag-tag affinity purification followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Six proteins, such as tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (14-3-3epsilon) and PKM, which potentially interacted with S100A9, were successfully identified. Gene ontology analysis of the identified proteins suggested that proteins interacted with S100A8 or S100A9 were involved in several biological pathways, including canonical glycolysis, positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity, negative regulation of apoptotic process, cell-cell adhesion, etc. Co-IP experiment confirmed that PKM2 can interact with both S100A8 and S100A9, and 14-3-3epsilon can interact with S100A8. Conclusion: PKM2 is identified to interact with both S100A8 and S100A9, while 14-3-3epsilon can interact with S100A9. These results may provide a new clue for the role of S100A8 or S100A9 in the progression of colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
