The activities (per g of tissue) of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were unchanged throughout lactation in liver and in kidney cortex. In both these tissues glucose 6-phosphatase activity decreased during late lactation. At the same time fructose diphosphatase activity increased in kidney cortex but not in liver. Activities of the pentose cycle dehydrogenases and of aspartate aminotransferase tended to increase in mid lactation. For most enzymes the activities at peak lactation were similar to those for dry, non-pregnant cows and there was no specific response of the gluconeogenic enzymes. Total hepatic contents of most enzymes tended to increase in mid lactation, but the changes were not clear cut and were the result of an increase in liver size.
