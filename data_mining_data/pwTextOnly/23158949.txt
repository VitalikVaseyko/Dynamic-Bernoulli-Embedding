OBJECTIVE: To determine the ameliorative potentials of Syzygium jambolanum (SJ) extract in L6 skeletal muscle cells in regard to arsenic-induced impairment of optimum glucose homeostasis and improper functioning of mitochondria. METHODS: Several study parameters like glucose level and mitochondrial functioning through indexes of pyruvate kinase, glucokinase and mitochondrial membrane potential were assessed. The expression of the relevant marker proteins and mRNAs like glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS2 and glucokinase for tracking down the signalling cascade were critically analyzed. RESULTS: Introduction of SJ extract could bring about positive modulation of various markers, by acting on GLUT4, thereby bringing about an attenuation of the arsenite-induced toxic conditions in L6 cells. CONCLUSION: Syzygium jambolanum extract has considerable ameliorating potentials against arsenic-induced glucose imbalance and stress and has possibility of therapeutic use in the management of arsenic-induced toxicity including hyperglycemia.
