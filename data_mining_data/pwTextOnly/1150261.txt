A method of starch gel electrophoresis is described which enables detection of 6 isozymes of human pyruvate kinase (PK, E.C.2.7.1.40). Comparing the PK-isozyme patterns of 53 diverse human tumors with those of normal adult and fetal organ tissues, it was found that the isozyme PK I is predominant in all malignant tumors as well as in almost all fetal organs.
