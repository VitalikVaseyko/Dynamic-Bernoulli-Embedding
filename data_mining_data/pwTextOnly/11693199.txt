Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek) seed powder has been suggested to have potential antidiabetic effects. The effect of oral administration of Trigonella whole seed powder (5% in the diet) for 21 days on glycolytic, gluconeogenic and NADP-linked lipogenic enzymes were studied in liver and kidney tissues of alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Diabetic rats were characterised by a 4-fold higher blood glucose level and a 0.7-fold lower body weight compared to normal controls. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes were significantly lower in the diabetic liver and higher in the diabetic kidney. The activities of gluconeogenic enzymes were higher in both liver and kidney during diabetes, however the activities of the lipogenic enzymes were decreased in both tissues during diabetes. Trigonella seed powder treatment to diabetic rats for 21 days brought down the elevated fasting blood glucose levels to control levels. The altered enzyme activities were significantly restored to control values in both the liver and kidney after Trigonella seed powder treatment. The therapeutic role of Trigonella seed powder in type-1 diabetes as exemplified in this study can be attributed to the change of glucose and lipid metabolising enzyme activities to normal values, thus stabilizing glucose homeostasis in the liver and kidney. These biochemical effects exerted by Trigonella seeds make it a possible new therapeutic in type-1 diabetes.
