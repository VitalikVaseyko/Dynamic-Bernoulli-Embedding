The dynamics of glycolysis and glycogenolysis in the postnatal period, determined from the accumulation of lactate in the homogenate of the heart muscle, indicates that the glycolytic activity begins to subside right after the birth and becomes constant after a lapse of 15-20 days. The activity of the phosphorylase, phosphohexoisomerase, enolase and pyruvate-kinase in the heart muscle extract was found to remain virtually unchanged. Some decline is noted in the activity of the aldolase and hexokinase, while that of the phosphofructokinase and lactate-dehydrogenase rises by 50-60 per cent. These data suggest that in the early ontogenesis the increasing capacity of the mitochondrial system in the heart muscle is paralled by an adjustable conditioned inhibition of the glycolytic phosphorylation, with concurrently rising activity of the phosphofructokinas and, consequently, also of the potential capacity of glycolysis and glycogenolysis.
