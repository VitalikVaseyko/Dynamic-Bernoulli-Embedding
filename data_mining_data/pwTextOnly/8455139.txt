Exposure of rat cortical neurons to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coat protein gp120 in vitro causes a rise in the intracellular Ca2+ level and a subsequent translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the membrane. Such a translocation persists for at least 2 h, but only in cultures with media not depleted of endogenous glutamate. Enzymatic degradation of glutamate in the medium by the enzyme glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) abolishes the long-lasting effect of gp120 on the association state of PKC; under this incubation condition the translocation period is < 1 h. Memantine and the ganglioside GM1 prevent N-methyl D-aspartate receptor-mediated long-term translocation of PKC and gp120-mediated neurotoxicity (in the absence of GPT); they have no effect on short-term translocation of PKC. We suggest that gp120-caused neuronal death involves an indirect sensitization step of the NMDA receptors, which ultimately induces neuronal death.
