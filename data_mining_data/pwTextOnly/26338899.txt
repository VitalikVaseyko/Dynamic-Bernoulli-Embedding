UNLABELLED: With the introduction of combined PET/MR spectroscopic (MRS) imaging, it is now possible to directly and indirectly image the Warburg effect with hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate and (18)F-FDG PET imaging, respectively, via a technique we have named hyperPET. The main purpose of this present study was to establish a practical workflow for performing (18)F-FDG PET and hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate MRS imaging simultaneously for tumor tissue characterization and on a larger scale test its feasibility. In addition, we evaluated the correlation between (18)F-FDG uptake and (13)C-lactate production. METHODS: Ten dogs with biopsy-verified spontaneous malignant tumors were included for imaging. All dogs underwent a protocol of simultaneous (18)F-FDG PET, anatomic MR, and hyperpolarized dynamic nuclear polarization with (13)C-pyruvate imaging. The data were acquired using a combined clinical PET/MR imaging scanner. RESULTS: We found that combined (18)F-FDG PET and (13)C-pyruvate MRS imaging was possible in a single session of approximately 2 h. A continuous workflow was obtained with the injection of (18)F-FDG when the dogs was placed in the PET/MR scanner. (13)C-MRS dynamic acquisition demonstrated in an axial slab increased (13)C-lactate production in 9 of 10 dogs. For the 9 dogs, the (13)C-lactate was detected after a mean of 25 s (range, 17-33 s), with a mean to peak of (13)C-lactate at 49 s (range, 40-62 s). (13)C-pyruvate could be detected on average after 13 s (range, 5-26 s) and peaked on average after 25 s (range, 13-42 s). We noticed concordance of (18)F-FDG uptake and production of (13)C-lactate in most, but not all, axial slices. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have shown in a series of dogs with cancer that hyperPET can easily be performed within 2 h. We showed mostly correspondence between (13)C-lactate production and (18)F-FDG uptake and expect the combined modalities to reveal additional metabolic information to improve prognostic value and improve response monitoring.
