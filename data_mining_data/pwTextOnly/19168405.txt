BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the clinical significance of serum Tu M2-PK and CA19-9 detection in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: The tumour markers (Tu M2-PK and CA19-9) in 115 patients with cholangiocarcinoma, 85 patients with benign disease and 120 blood donors were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: The levels of serum Tu M2-PK and CA19-9 were markedly higher in the patients with cholangiocarcinoma than in controls (P<0.05). Tu M2-PK showed more sensitivity (84.2%) and specificity (90%) than CA19-9 (68.4%) and (75%). CONCLUSIONS: Tu M2-PK may be used as a valuable diagnosis marker in cholangiocarcinoma.
