Membranes of intact erythrocytes were labeled by the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) using an improved labeling procedure described previously (Plasek, J. and Jarolim, P. (1987) Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 6, 425-437). The relationship between the steady-state DPH fluorescence anisotropy r and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) was studied. Fluorescence anisotropy increased with increasing MCHC. A linear dependence of r = 0.0026 (MCHC) + 0.113 was obtained which enabled us to measure the fluidity of intact red cell membranes. Without this correction for fluorescence quenching by hemoglobin, incorrect conclusions about membrane fluidity could be made. This fact is demonstrated in a group of pyruvate kinase deficient patients compared with a group of healthy blood donors.
