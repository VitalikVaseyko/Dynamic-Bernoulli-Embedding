The effect of adenylic acid, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-diphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate on creatine kinase isoenzymes (brain extract, muscle and heart extracts and purified muscle enzyme) was studied. These effectors, especially phosphoenolpyruvate, are shown to inhibit in different degree the reaction of ATP formation catalysed by creatine kinase from all tissues. The effectors do not inhibit the creatine phosphate synthesis in extracts, but depress purified creatine kinase. The interrelationship of the creatine kinase system and the key glycolytic enzymes (phosphofructokinase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) is discussed.
