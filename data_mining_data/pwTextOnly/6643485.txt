Control of gluconeogenesis from lactate was studied by titrating rat liver cells with lactate and pyruvate in a ratio of 10:1 in a perifusion system. At different steady states of glucose formation, the concentration of key gluconeogenic intermediates was measured and plotted against gluconeogenic flux (J glucose). Complete saturation was observed only in the plot relating J glucose to the extracellular pyruvate concentration. Measurement of pyruvate distribution in the cell showed that the mitochondrial pyruvate translocator operates close to equilibrium at high lactate and pyruvate concentrations. It can therefore be concluded that pyruvate carboxylase limits maximal gluconeogenic flux. Addition of glucagon did not cause a shift in the plots relating J glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate. It can thus be concluded that glucagon does not affect the kinetic parameters of the enzymes involved in the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose. Addition of glucagon led to a shift in the curves relating J glucose to the concentration of cytosolic oxalacetate and extracellular pyruvate. The shift in the curve relating J glucose to oxalacetate is due to glucagon-induced inhibition of pyruvate kinase. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon can be accounted for almost completely by inhibition of pyruvate kinase. There was almost no stimulation by glucagon of pyruvate carboxylation. In the absence of glucagon, control on gluconeogenesis from lactate is distributed among different steps including pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase. Assuming that in the presence of glucagon all pyruvate kinase flux is inhibited, the control of gluconeogenesis in the presence of the hormone is confined exclusively to pyruvate carboxylase.
