A Somali cat was presented with recurrent anorexia, lethargy, vomiting and icterus. A macrocytic-hypochromic, regenerative haemolytic anaemia was identified and hereditary pyruvate kinase deficiency was confirmed by means of breed-specific DNA mutation analysis. The case was complicated by the presence of markedly elevated serum liver enzyme activities, hyperbilirubinaemia, coagulopathy and ultrasonographic evidence of gall bladder choleliths and extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. The choleliths consisted of 100 per cent bilirubin, likely because of chronic haemolysis and haeme degradation. In conclusion, haemosiderosis and bilirubin cholelithiasis can be a consequence of chronic haemolysis in pyruvate kinase-deficient cats, as seen in human beings with a variety of chronic haemolytic disorders.
