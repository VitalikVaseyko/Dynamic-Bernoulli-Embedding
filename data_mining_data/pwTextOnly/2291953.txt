The administration of captopril (CP, 30 mg/kg) limited the arterial hypertension induced by the coarctation of the renal arteria and cardiac hypertrophy in rats. CP prevented the activation of MB-KK and glucoso-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Besides CP decreased the activity of pyruvate kinase and increased that of malate dehydrogenase. These data demonstrate, that CP prevents both the cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic changes in animals with the renal hypertension.
