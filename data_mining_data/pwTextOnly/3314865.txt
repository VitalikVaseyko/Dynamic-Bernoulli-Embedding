In tissue culture of hepatocytes, insulin (0.1-1 munits/ml for 4 h) reversed completely the effects of starvation of rats to decrease the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex and to increase the activities of PDH kinase and PDH kinase activator protein. It had no effect in hepatocytes from fed rats. Significant effects of insulin were detected with 0.01 munit/ml after 4 h, and in 1-2 h with 1 munit/ml.
