Hexokinase 1 (HK1) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) are two key regulators in glycosis and oncogenic markers in cancers. In the present study, we investigated the expression profile by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and determined their prognostic values in the gastric cancer. Expression of HK1 and PKM2 was remarkably increased in gastric cancer tissues and was significantly associated lymphatic metastasis and advanced TNM staging. In the COX regression model, HK1 and TNM stage were analyzed as adverse prognostic indicators in gastric cancer. Furthermore, patients with HK1 expression showed remarkable shorter survival duration in both lymphatic metastasis cohort and advanced staging cohort. Our results suggest that overexpression of PKM2 and HK1, especially the latter, significantly associates with lymphatic metastasis, advanced clinical staging and unfavorable prognosis in gastric cancer.
