The M1 pyruvate kinase has been localized in macroneuron's cytoplasm of nervous tissue of adult Rat, in situ as well as in tissue culture. Three methods have been used: histoenzymology, immunoenzymology and immunofluorescence, combined with Nomarski optics. This enzymatic localization may suggest a metabolic or differenciated fonctionnal state of the nerve cell.
