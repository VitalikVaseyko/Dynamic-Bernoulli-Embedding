Freeze inactivation of LDH, MDH, ADH, G-6-PDH, and PK and its prevention with additives such as sodium glutamate and albumin were studied. LDH, MDH, ADH, G-6-PDH, and PK, each lost their activity during frozen storage at -20 degrees C. The speed of the inactivation differed in each. The stability of the enzymes increased with the increase of the enzyme concentration. Sodium glutamate and albumin prevented the freeze inactivation. While the activity of the LDH solution frozen without additives was almost lost during a day of frozen storage, those frozen with either glutamate (0.2 M) or albumin (0.1%) added decreased less quickly. The residual activity after 1 day was 50% the initial prefreeze value for the former and 10% for the latter, respectively. Combined use of glutamate and albumin prevented the inactivation the best and maintained the initial activity almost completely over 6 weeks. The enzymes tested lost some part of their activity when their solutions were diluted by the media. This inactivation was prevented to a significant extent by the addition of sodium glutamate and/or albumin to the diluting media.
