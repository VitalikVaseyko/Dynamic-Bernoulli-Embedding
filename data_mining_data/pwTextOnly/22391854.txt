In this investigation, combined effects of quercetin and atenolol in the regulation of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity have been evaluated in rats. While ISO administration increased the levels of serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) as well as cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA); it reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and the level of reduced glutathione. ISO-induced rats also exhibited ST-segment elevation and tachycardia. Oral administration of atenolol (6 mg/kg) and quercetin (5 mg/kg), along with ISO (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) every day for 10 days markedly reduced the serum CK-MB, LDH and SGPT levels. Concomitantly the test drugs improved the status of antioxidative enzymes, decreased the cardiac MDA and nearly normalized the electrocardiogram. Electron paramagnetic resonance study also revealed a decrease in 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide-hydroxyl radicals signal intensity when atenolol and quercetin were administered together to ISO-treated rats. In conclusion, the combined treatment of atenolol and quercetin appears to produce a better cardioprotective effect in ISO-induced animals as compared to their individual treatments, and possibly the beneficial actions are associated with the free radical scavenging action of quercetin.
