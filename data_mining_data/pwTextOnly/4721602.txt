1. The degradation rates and half-lives of hexokinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and aldolase were calculated from measurements of the decline in activities of these enzymes in rat small intestine during starvation. 2. The half-lives of the enzymes are: hexokinase, 5.7h; 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, 7.6h; glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6.0h; pyruvate kinase, 8.9h; lactate dehydrogenase, 8.7h; phosphoglycerate kinase, 8.7h; aldolase, 5.1h. 3. The significance of the results is discussed with respect to the regulation of enzyme concentrations in response to changes in diet.
