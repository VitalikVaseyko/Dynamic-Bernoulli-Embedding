Cancer cells prefer glycolysis for energy metabolism, even when there is sufficient oxygen to make it unnecessary. This is called the Warburg effect, and it promotes tumorigenesis and malignant progression. In this study, we demonstrated that EZH2, a multifaceted oncogenic protein involved in tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis, promotes glioblastoma tumorigenesis and malignant progression through activation of the Warburg effect. We observed that HIF1alpha is a target of EZH2 whose activation is necessary for EZH2-mediated metabolic adaption, and that HIF1alpha is activated upon EZH2 overexpression. EZH2 suppressed expression of EAF2, which in turn upregulated HIF1alpha levels. We conclude from these results that EZH2 promotes tumorigenesis and malignant progression in part by activating glycolysis through an EAF2-HIF1alpha signaling axis.
