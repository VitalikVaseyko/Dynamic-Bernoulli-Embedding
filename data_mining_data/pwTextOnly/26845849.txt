It was studied the effect of doxorubicin on the HIF system and the pro-antioxidant balance of neonatal cardiomyocytes as well as the possibility of the oxidative stress correcting using curcumin. It has been revealed that the expression of mRNA HIF-1alpha using doxorubicin at a dose of 0.5 muM was 2.9 +/- 0.8 cu, so it decreased by 20% compared to control--3.6 +/- 0.7 cu (P < 0.05). The level of expression of the HIF target gene PDK-1 also significantly decreased (4 times). During the incubation with doxorubicin, the number of live cells decreased by 50.4% relative to control. And after using doxorubicin and curcumin together, the percentage of dead cells decreased by 7,7 compared to doxorubicin only. Doxorubicin intoxication led to a significant increase in the secondary products of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) in cardiomyocytes by 3.6 times and hydrogen peroxide by 64%. Prolonged incubation with doxorubicin reduced the enzymatic activity of Mn-SOD by 32%, while catalase activity increased by 72% compared to control. Adding of curcumin to the cardiomyocyte cell culture contributed to increasing of the Mn-SOD activity by 14%, catalase--by 23%. The level of TBARS increased by 1,4 times compared with the control, and the level of H2O2 increased by 20%. The joint use of doxorubicin and curcumin resulted in a significant reduction of free radical oxidation unlike effect of doxorubicin per se. Specifically, there was lessening of TBARS and H2O2 (at 56.7 and 18.4% respectively), while decreasing of the catalase hyperactivation (19%) and rising of the Mn-SOD activity (35%).
