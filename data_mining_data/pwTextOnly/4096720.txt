The effects of endotoxin administration on glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in dog livers were studied. Changes in metabolite concentrations were expressed graphically as percentages of controls using "crossover" plots in order to identify transitory rate-controlling steps. The results show that endotoxin administration increased glycolytic flux through pyruvate kinase, inhibited gluconeogenic flux through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, decreased glycogen storage, shifted cytosolic and mitochondrial redox state from a relatively oxidized to a more reduced state, decreased the extra- and intramitochondrial malate-aspartate and glutamate-alpha-ketoglutarate shuttle activities, depleted ATP, ADP, and NADP concentrations, and decreased energy charge. Based on these data, it is concluded that pyruvate kinase plays the major role in the control of glycolysis, while phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is the major controlling step for the regulation of gluconeogenesis in dog livers during endotoxic shock. In addition, the major factor in the regulation of metabolic pathways that produce and utilize high-energy phosphates in the livers was impaired in endotoxic shock.
