Nucleoside phosphorylase activity was assayed in two previously reported patients with trisomy for the proximal portion of 14q. A sesquialter dosage effect was demonstrated in erythrocytes as well as in leucocytes. These results are in favor of an ubiquitous expression of the gene and confirm its assignment to 14q13.
