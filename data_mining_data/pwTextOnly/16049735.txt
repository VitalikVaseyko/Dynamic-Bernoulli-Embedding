Sodium citrate, added to culture medium at 2 g l-1, increased inosine production by B. subtilis by 18% to 16 g l-1. The phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) pool was increased by 2.3-fold, while the pyruvate and acetate pools were decreased by 78% and 57%, respectively. Pyruvate kinase might thus be a regulatory site for inosine synthesis.
