Dysregulation of metabolism during melanoma progression is tightly associated with the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations in regulators of metabolic pathways. Retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) is epigenetically silenced in a large proportion of melanomas, but a link between RARbeta and metabolic rewiring of melanoma has not been established. Here, we show that in primary human melanocytes, all-trans retinoic acid (a RARbeta agonist) induced growth inhibition accompanied by a decrease in both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, whereas selective inhibition of RARbeta led to an increase in the basal glycolytic rate and increased sensitivity to inhibition of glycolysis. In melanoma cells, inhibition of RARbeta promoted lower mitochondrial respiration and higher glycolytic activity, which led to energetic stress and activation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase. This metabolic shift increased the sensitivity to both glycolytic inhibition and stimulation of mitochondrial metabolism with dichloroacetate, an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. In melanoma cells harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, RARbeta activation antagonized the effect of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib). Collectively, these data suggest that RARbeta signaling is involved in regulating cellular metabolism in melanoma and may provide a potential target in combination treatment strategies.
