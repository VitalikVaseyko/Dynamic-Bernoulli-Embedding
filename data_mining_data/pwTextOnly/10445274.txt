The age dynamics of activities of enzymes which catalysis several stages of metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase) and antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) was studied in the bone marrow erythroid cells of pig during the 10-day period after birth as well as in the cells of 30 days old animals. It was established that in the neonatal period of development the reorganization of energy metabolism in pig bone marrow erythrokaryocytes took place. It consisted in the intensification of oxidative processes and in a great measure was directed on the activation of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase formation in the nature red cells. During the early period after birth the activation of antioxidant system in erythroid cells of pig bone marrow was observed.
