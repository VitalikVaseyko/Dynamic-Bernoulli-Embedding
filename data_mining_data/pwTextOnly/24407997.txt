Addition of ammonia to a suspension of photosynthesizing isolated mesophyll cells from P. somniferum quantitatively alters the pattern of carbon metabolism by increasing rates of certain key ratelimiting steps leading to amino-acid synthesis and by decreasing rates of rate-limiting steps in alternative biosynthetic pathways. Of particular importance is the stimulation of reactions mediated by pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The increased rates of these two reactions, which result in an increased flow of carbon into the tricarboxylic-acid cycle, correlate with a rapid rise in glutamine (via glutamine synthetase) which draws carbon off the tricarboxylic-acid cycle as alpha-ketoglutarate. Increased flux of carbon in this direction appears to come mainly at the expense of sucrose synthesis. The net effect of addition of ammonia to mesophyll cells is thus a redistribution of newly fixed carbon away from carbohydrates and into amino acids.
