Neuroblastoma is one of the most common solid tumors in childhood and usually accompanied with poor prognosis and rapid tumor progression when diagnosed with amplification of the proto-oncogene N-Myc. The amplification of N-Myc has major influence on the maintenance of aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. This specific switch in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate instead of the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A even in the presence of oxygen has important benefits for the tumor, e.g. increased production of enzymes and enzyme substrates that are involved in tumor progression, angiogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis. The antiprotozoal drug nifurtimox, which is generally used for the treatment of infections with the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, has been reported to have cytotoxic properties in the therapy of neuroblastoma. However, its action of mechanism has not been described in detail yet. The presented in vitro study on the neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-1, IMR-32, LS and SK-N-SH shows an increased production of oxidative stress, a reduced lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity and reduced lactate production after nifurtimox treatment. Furthermore, nifurtimox leads to reduced mRNA and protein levels of the proto-oncogene protein N-Myc. Thus, the current work gives new insights into the effect of nifurtimox on tumor metabolism revealing a shifted glucose metabolism from production of lactate to oxidative phosphorylation and a reduced expression of the major molecular prognostic factor in neuroblastoma N-Myc, presenting nifurtimox as a possible adjuvant therapeutic agent against (high risk) neuroblastoma.
