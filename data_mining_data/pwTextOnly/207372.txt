The activities of gluconeogenic enzymes of the rat kidney cortex was studied after exposure to lowered atmospheric pressure (200 mm Hg) for 3 hours. The hypoxic stress was found to cause an increase in the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and alanine aminotransferase, but failed to affect significantly the activities of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and aspartate aminotranspherase. The ratio of glucose-6-phosphatase/hexokinase activities was increased under these conditions.
