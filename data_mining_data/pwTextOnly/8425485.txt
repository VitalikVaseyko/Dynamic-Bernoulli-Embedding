Two insulin mediators, inositol phosphoglycans, were isolated from bovine liver by methods previously developed for rat liver, i.e. chromatography on an AG 1 x 8 ion exchange column and selective elution with HCl at pH 2.0 and 1.3. The pH 2.0 mediator containing D-chiroinositol stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, whereas the pH 1.3 mediator containing myo-inositol inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Each mediator was further purified by thin layer and Bio-Gel P4 column chromatography and injected ip into normal fed rats together with [U-14C]glucose. After 2.5 h, diaphragms were removed, and glycogen isolated. Insulin mediators, like insulin, stimulated [U-14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen by 150-160% in a dose-dependent manner in the nanomolar range. Mediators injected iv in the nanomolar range into low dose streptozotocin-diabetic rats decreased plasma glucose 30-45% in 30-60 min, with a return to basal concentrations after 150-180 min. These in vivo insulin-like effects of mediator were observed without changes in serum insulin concentrations. The pH 2.0 mediator was 50-100 times more active (per nmol organic phosphate) than the pH 1.3 mediator in the ip diaphragm glycogenesis assay. Mediator effects on diaphragm were completely blocked by preincubation with an immunopurified inositol phosphoglycan antibody. Both mediators were equally active iv in lowering plasma glucose (per nmol inositol) at concentrations comparable to those of insulin.
