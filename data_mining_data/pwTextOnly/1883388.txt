Using a T7 expression system, the monomer of rat pituitary pyruvate kinase, subtype M1 (PKM1), was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The monomeric p58-M1 has intrinsic enzymatic activity with a Vmax of 79 +/- 20 units/mg and Km's for ADP and PEP of 1.43 +/- 0.76 and 0.14 +/- 0.07 mM, respectively. The monomer binds 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) with Ka = 1.5 x 10(7) M-1. The order of analog specificity is L-T3 greater than L-thyroxine greater than D-T3 greater than 3'-isopropyl-3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine greater than or equal to 3',5',3-triiodo-L-thyronine. In contrast, tetrameric PKM1 lacks T3 binding activity. The kinase activity of p58-M1 is inhibited by T3 and its analogs in a concentration-dependent manner with the order of inhibitory activity similar to that of binding activity. This inhibition, however, is reversed by the addition of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. p58-M1 is the second PK isoenzyme monomer to be identified as having thyroid hormone binding activity.
