This study investigated the effect of jicama extract on hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity in an animal model of type 2 diabetes. Male C57BL/Ksj-db/db mice were divided into groups subsequently fed a regular diet (controls), or diet supplemented with jicama extract, and rosiglitazone. After 6 weeks, blood levels of glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were significantly lower in animals administered the jicama extract than the control group. Additionally, glucose and insulin tolerance tests showed that jicama extract increased insulin sensitivity. The homeostatic index of insulin resistance was lower in the jicama extract-treated group than in the diabetic control group. Administration of jicama extract significantly enhanced the expressions of the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and Akt substrate of 160 kDa, and plasma membrane glucose transporter type 4 in skeletal muscle. Jicama extract administration also decreased the expressions of glucose 6-phosphatase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase in the liver. Jicama extract may increases insulin sensitivity and inhibites the gluconeogenesis in the liver.
