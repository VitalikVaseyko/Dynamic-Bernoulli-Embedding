Experimental designs used to monitor the magnitude of an allosteric response can greatly influence observed values. We report here the impact of buffer, monovalent cation, divalent cation, and anion on the magnitude of the allosteric regulation of the affinity of human liver pyruvate kinase (hL-PYK) for substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The magnitudes of the allosteric activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-BP) and the allosteric inhibition by alanine are independent of most, but not all buffers tested. However, these magnitudes are dependent on whether Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) is included as the divalent cation. In the presence of Mn(2+), any change in K(app-PEP) caused by Fru-1,6-BP is minimal. hL-PYK activity does not appear to require monovalent cation. Monovalent cation binding in the active site impacts PEP affinity with minimum influence on the magnitude of allosteric coupling. However, Na(+) and Li(+) reduce the magnitude of the allosteric response to Fru-1,6-BP, likely due to mechanisms outside of the active site. Which anion is used to maintain a constant monovalent cation concentration also influences the magnitude of the allosteric response. The value of determining the impact of ions on allosteric function can be appreciated by considering that representative structures used in comparative studies have often been determined using protein crystals grown in diverse buffer and salt conditions.
