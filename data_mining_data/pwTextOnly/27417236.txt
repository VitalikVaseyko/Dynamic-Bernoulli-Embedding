Epigenetic regulation by histone methyltransferase G9a is known to control autophagic responses. As the link between autophagy and metabolic homeostasis is widely accepted, we investigated whether G9a affects metabolic circuitries to affect autophagic response in glioma cells. Both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of G9a increased autophagy marker LC3B in glioma cells. G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 (BIX) induced Akt-dependent increase in HIF-1alpha expression and activity. Inhibition of Akt-HIF-1alpha axis reversed BIX-mediated (i) increase in LC3B expression and (ii) decrease in Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) phosphorylation. YAP1 over-expression abrogated BIX induced increase in LC3B expression. Interestingly, BIX induced increase in metabolic modelers TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) and PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2) were crucial for BIX-mediated changes, as transfection with TIGAR mutant or PKM2 siRNA reversed BIX-mediated alterations in pYAP1 and LC3B expression. Coherent with the in vitro observation, BIX had no significant effect on the tumor burden in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Elevated LC3B and PKM2 in BIX-treated xenograft tissue was accompanied by decreased YAP1 levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that Akt-HIF-1alpha axis driven PKM2-YAP1 cross talk activates autophagic responses in glioma cells upon G9a inhibition.
