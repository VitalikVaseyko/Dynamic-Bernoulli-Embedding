The technology for fluorescence protein-sensing is advancing rapidly owing to the continued introduction of new concepts, new fluorophores, and proteins engineered for sensing-specific analytes. Concerns about the reversibility and selectivity of engineered proteins are being addressed by developing biosensors that are based on the utilisation of coenzyme-depleted enzymes. Such biomolecules do not consume the substrate and can exhibit conformational changes upon the binding of the analyte, which can be easily detected as fluorescence change. In addition, concerns about the stability of biosensors can be overcome by using thermostable enzymes isolated from thermophilic microorganisms. Finally, the development of new techniques such as polarization-based sensing, anisotropy-based sensing and lifetime-based sensing, all of which can be accomplished with light-emitting diodes as the light source, is prompting the design of a new class of specific and stable biosensors, as has occurred with blood glucose measurement. These biosensors represent a valid alternative to the conventional clinical chemistry diagnostics.
