Coenzyme A (CoA) and its thioester derivative acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) participate in over 100 different reactions in intermediary metabolism of microorganisms. Earlier results indicated that overexpression of upstream rate-limiting enzyme pantothenate kinase with simultaneous supplementation of precursor pantothenic acid to the culture media increased intracellular CoA levels significantly ( approximately 10-fold). The acetyl-CoA levels also increased ( approximately 5-fold) but not as much as that of CoA, showing that the carbon flux from the pyruvate node is rate-limiting upon an increase in CoA levels. In this study, pyruvate dehydrogenase was overexpressed under elevated CoA levels to increase carbon flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This coexpression did not increase intracellular acetyl-CoA levels but increased the accumulation of extracellular acetate. The production of isoamyl acetate, an industrially useful compound derived from acetyl-CoA, was used as a model reporter system to signify the beneficial effects of this metabolic engineering strategy. In addition, a strain was created in which the acetate production pathway was inactivated to relieve competition at the acetyl-CoA node and to efficiently channel the enhanced carbon flux to the ester production pathway. The synergistic effect of cofactor CoA manipulation and pyruvate dehydrogenase overexpression in the acetate pathway deletion mutant led to a 5-fold increase in isoamyl acetate production. Under normal growth conditions the acetate pathway deletion mutant strains accumulate intracellular pyruvate, leading to excretion of pyruvate. However, upon enhancing the carbon flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the excretion of pyruvate was significantly reduced.
