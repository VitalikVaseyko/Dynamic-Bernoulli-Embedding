BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Gefitinib is a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, and has been used in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study was to evaluate the efficacy of Gefitinib on advanced NSCLC, and observe adverse events. METHODS: An open labeled, expanded access program (EAP) was conducted. Pathologically confirmed advanced NSCLC patients who had progressed after systemic chemotherapy or was not suitable for systemic chemotherapy were eligible for this program. Gefitinib (250 mg) was orally administered daily till disease progression or intolerable adverse events developed. RESULTS: From Sep. 2002 to Mar. 2005, 120 patients were enrolled, and 103 of them were assessable for response. The objective response rate was 18.4% (19/103). The disease control rate was 51.5% (53/103). The median survival time was 6 months (0.5-33 months). Adverse events were generally mild (grade I or II), including skin rash (30.1%), dry skin (12.6%), and diarrhea (25.2%). Two (1.9%) patients developed grade III elevation of serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT). No grade IV adverse event occurred. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib is effective in treating advanced NSCLC, and the adverse events are mild.
