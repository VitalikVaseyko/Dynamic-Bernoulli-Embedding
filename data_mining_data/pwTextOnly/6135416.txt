1. The effects of intragastric glucose feeding and L-tri-iodothyronine (T3) administration on rates of hepatic and brown-fat lipogenesis in vivo were examined in fed and 48 h-starved rats. 2. T3 treatment increased hepatic lipogenesis in the fed but not the starved animals. Brown-fat lipogenesis was unaffected or slightly decreased by T3 treatment of fed or starved rats. 3. Intragastric glucose feeding increased hepatic lipogenesis in control or T3-treated fed rats, but did not increase hepatic lipogenesis in starved control rats. Glucose feeding increased hepatic lipogenesis if the starved rats were treated with T3. Glucose feeding increased rates of brown-fat lipogenesis in all experimental groups. The effects of glucose feeding on liver and brown-fat lipogenesis were mimicked by insulin injection. 4. The increase in hepatic lipogenesis in T3-treated 48 h-starved rats after intragastric glucose feeding was prevented by short-term insulin deficiency, but not by (-)-hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase. The increase in lipogenesis in brown adipose tissue in response to glucose feeding was inhibited by both short-term insulin deficiency and (-)-hydroxycitrate. 5. The results tend to preclude pyruvate kinase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase as the sites of interaction of insulin and T3 in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis in 48 h-starved rats. Other potential sites of interaction are discussed.
