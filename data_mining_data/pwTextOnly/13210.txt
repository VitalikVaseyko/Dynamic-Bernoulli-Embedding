One hundred and seven Wistar rats, 8 weeks old and weighing 180-200 g, were housed under conditions of controlled temperature (22 plus or minus 2 degrees) and lighting (light on from 07:00 to 19:00). They were divided into 2 groups and fed diets containing either 15 per cent cas-protein for 23 days. Food consumption was recorded every 2 hours for each animal during 48 hours. Four or five rats from each group were killed every 2 hours for 24 hours and the hepatic activities of PK (EC.2.7.1.40),G6P-DH (EC1.1.1.49), ME (EC1.1.1.40), Acetyl-CoA-carbox (EC.6.4.1.2.),PC(EC.6.4.1.1.), PEP-CK(EC.4.1.1.32), G6Pase (EC.3.1.3.9) and GPT (EC.2.6.1.2.) were measured...
