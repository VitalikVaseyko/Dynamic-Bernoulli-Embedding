BACKGROUND: Partial fatty acid oxidation inhibitors have raised great interest since they are expected to counteract a dysregulated gene expression of hypertrophied cardiocytes. Some of these compounds have been developed for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stable angina pectoris. A shift from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation leads to a reduced gluconeogenesis and improved economy of cardiac work. An increased glucose oxidation can be achieved with the following enzyme inhibitors: etomoxir, oxfenicine, methyl palmoxirate, S-15176, metoprolol, amiodarone, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1); aminocarnitine, perhexiline (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2); hydrazonopropionic acid (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase); MET-88 (gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase); 4-bromocrotonic acid, trimetazidine, possibly ranolazine (thiolases); hypoglycin (butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase); dichloroacetate (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase). CLINICAL TRIALS with trimetazidine and ranolazine showed that this shift in substrate oxidation has an antianginal action. Etomoxir and MET-88 improved the function of overloaded hearts by increasing the density of the Ca(2+) pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2). The promoters of SERCA2 and alpha-myosin heavy-chain exhibit sequences which are expected to respond to transcription factors responsive to glucose metabolites and/or peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPAR) agonists. Further progress in elucidating novel compounds which upregulate SERCA2 expression is closely linked to the characterization of regulatory sequences of the SERCA2 promoter.
