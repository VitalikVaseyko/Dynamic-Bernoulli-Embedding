The effect of substrate phosphorylation on the susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by trypsin-like enzymes was investigated using the model heptapeptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly, a peptide representing the endogenous phosphorylation site of pyruvate kinase. Phosphorylation of Ser 5 altered the kinetics of proteolysis by two proteases, trypsin and rat plasma kallikrein, both of which cleaved between Arg 3 and Ala 4. In the case of trypsin, phosphorylation decreased the rate of cleavage 47-fold. In the case of rat plasma kallikrein, phosphorylation decreased proteolysis 13-fold. Phosphorylation resulted in an apparent redirection of the preferential site from Arg 3 to Arg 2. Because sequences analogous to this model peptide are commonly found in exposed domains of globular proteins, and since these regions are susceptible to both phosphorylation and protease attack, the results indicate that substrate phosphorylation may selectively influence protein processing and turnover.
