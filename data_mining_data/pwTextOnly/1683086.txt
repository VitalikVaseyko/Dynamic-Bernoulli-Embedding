Pyruvate kinase (PK) from red blood cells (RBC) of three patients with nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to PK deficiency was characterized according to internationally standardized methods. The variant enzymes, which were designated PK 'Memphis', PK 'Bartlett', and PK 'Pontotoc', had 11, 60, and 61%, respectively, of the normal enzyme activity. All variant PK enzymes had increased thermolability. Compared with control, Km (PEP) were 200-300% greater for PK 'Memphis', 50% less for PK 'Bartlett' and 300-400% greater for PK 'Pontotoc'. The Km (ADP) were 40 and 300% greater than normal for PK 'Bartlett' and PK 'Pontotoc', respectively. All variants required higher than normal concentrations of the allosteric modifier, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, to achieve 50% activation of maximal enzyme activity. To define the molecular basis of the gene defect, DNA samples from these patients were examined for restriction-fragment-linked polymorphisms. No differences were observed in the structure of the patients' PK genes compared with a normal control. These results are consistent with a mutation in coding sequences, rather than a large insertion, deletion or rearrangement of genetic information, as the underlying genetic defect that accounts for the altered enzyme properties in these PK-deficient patients.
