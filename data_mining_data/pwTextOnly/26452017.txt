This study investigated the effects of mangosteen on metabolic syndromes in high-fat (HF) diet-fed mice and the underlying mechanisms related to adipogenesis. Mangosteen-supplemented mice gained significantly less body weight, compared with the HF group. The levels were markedly elevated in HF mice for serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and free fatty acid; whereas these levels were significantly lower in the 200 mg/kg of the mangosteen extract-treated group. The mangosteen extract did not modify high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, however, LDL-cholesterol was lower and HDL/LDL ratio was higher (9.4 vs. 3.7 in HF group). Furthermore, 200 mg/kg of mangosteen treatment activated the hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase and Sirtuin 1 in an in vivo system. Thus, the results of this study suggest that mangosteen extract exerts antiobesity effects by regulating energy metabolism and hepatic lipid homeostasis.
