Although nitrosative stress is known to severely impede the ability of living systems to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, there is limited information on how microorganisms fulfill their energy needs in order to survive reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In this study we demonstrate an elaborate strategy involving substrate-level phosphorylation that enables the soil microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens to synthesize ATP in a defined medium with fumarate as the sole carbon source. The enhanced activities of such enzymes as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase coupled with the increased activities of phospho-transfer enzymes like adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphophate kinase provide an effective strategy to produce high energy nucleosides in an O2-independent manner. The alternate ATP producing machinery is fuelled by the precursors derived from fumarate with the aid of fumarase C and fumarate reductase. This metabolic reconfiguration is key to the survival of P. fluorescens and reveals potential targets against RNS-resistant organisms.
