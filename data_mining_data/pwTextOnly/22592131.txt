The aim of the present study was to investigate the participation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the control of glycerol-3-P (G3P) generating pathways in white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats in three situations in which the plasma insulin levels are low. WAT from 48 h fasted animals, 3 day-streptozotocin diabetic animals and high-protein, carbohydrate-free (HP) diet-fed rats was surgical denervated and the G3P generation pathways were evaluated. Food deprivation, diabetes and the HP diet provoke a marked decrease in the rate of glucose uptake and glycerokinase (GyK) activity, but a significant increase in the glyceroneogenesis, estimated by the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity and the incorporation of 1-[(14)C]-pyruvate into glycerol-TAG. The denervation provokes a reduction (~70%) in the NE content of WAT in fasted, diabetic and HP diet-fed rats. The denervation induced an increase in WAT glucose uptake of fed, fasted, diabetic and HP diet-fed rats (40%, 60%, 3.2 fold and 35%, respectively). TAG-glycerol synthesis from pyruvate was reduced by denervation in adipocytes of fed (58%) and fasted (36%), saline-treated (58%) and diabetic (23%), and HP diet-fed rats (11%). In these same groups the denervation reduced the PEPCK mRNA expression (75%-95%) and the PEPCK activity (35%-60%). The denervation caused a ~35% decrease in GyK activity of control rats and a further ~35% reduction in the already low enzyme activity of fasted, diabetic and HP diet-fed rats. These data suggest that the SNS plays an important role in modulating G3P generating pathways in WAT, in situations where insulin levels are low.
