The specificity of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was examined using two series of dodecapeptides as substrates. One series consisted of peptides of the general sequence (Gly)x-Arg-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y = 6. The other series consisted of peptides of the sequence (Gly)x-Lys-Arg-(Gly)y-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly in which x + y was again equal to 6. The peptides Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly and Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly were also examined. In the series in which the adjacent arginines were located various distances from the serine, the substrate for which the enzyme clearly exhibited optimal kinetic constants contained one amino acid residue between the basic residues and serine. Direct binding studies of N alpha-[3H]acetyl peptides to catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase revealed a correlation between binding affinity and the ability to serve as substrate for the enzyme. In the second series in which the adjacent basic amino acids were Lys-Arg, optimal kinetic constants were again obtained when these residues were separated from serine by a single amino acid. This latter result was surprising in view of phosphorylation site sequences in the known physiologically significant protein substrates for the kinase, since those containing Lys-Arg all contain two amino acids between these residues and serine.
