By c.d. studies it is shown that liver-pyruvate-kinase-related peptide substrates of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase have a high tendency towards non-random structures in non-aqueous media. When phosphorylated, the conformation tendencies decrease. This structural change is explained in terms of the formation of strong intrapeptide phosphate-guanidinium salt links. It is proposed that similar events occur at the catalytic site of protein kinase and that such an interaction could facilitate the removal of the phosphorylated products.
