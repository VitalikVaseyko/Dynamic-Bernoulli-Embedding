The complete nucleotide sequences of rat M1- and M2-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs were determined by sequencing the cDNAs and by analyses of S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension. The sequences have an identical molecular size of about 2220 nucleotides excluding a poly(A) tail and include 1593-nucleotide coding region. Their nucleotide sequences are identical except for 160-nucleotide sequences within the coding regions. The amino acid sequences of the M1- and M2-type subunits deduced from the cDNA sequences differ by only 45 residues within domain C, which constitutes the main region responsible for intersubunit contact. The sequence of this region of the M2-type shows higher homology than that of the M1-type with the corresponding sequence of the L-type. Since the M2- and L-types are allosteric enzymes, unlike to the M1-type, the residues common to the M2- and L-types, but not the M1-type may be important for mediating the allosteric properties. Genomic clones encoding both M1- and M2-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. By partial sequence analysis of a clone lambda MPK37 four exons were identified, of which two adjacent exons coded the M1- and M2-specific sequences, respectively. The two remaining exons present downstream coded amino acids common to the two isozymes. Thus, we conclude that the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from the same gene probably by alternative RNA splicing.
