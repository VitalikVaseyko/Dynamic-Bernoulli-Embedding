Targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice, where an oncogene is placed under the control of the regulatory sequences of a cell-specific gene, has been used to derive lines of differentiated kidney epithelial cells derived from proximal or distal tubules or from the collecting duct. These renal cell lines were obtained from kidneys of transgenic mice harboring the large-T and little-t antigens placed under the control of regulatory sequences of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene. This review summarizes the main properties of these differentiated cell lines, which are useful ex vivo cell systems for pharmacological and toxicological studies.
