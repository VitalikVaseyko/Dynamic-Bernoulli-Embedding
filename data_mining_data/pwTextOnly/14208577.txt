N(4)-benzyladenine, an active phytokinin, inhibits the respiration of many explants. The chemnical also delays senescence and extends the postharvest life of many green or leafy vegetables. Evidence is presented that these phenomena may be linked to a comnpetitive inhibition of the glycolytic kinases by N(4)-benzyladenine.
