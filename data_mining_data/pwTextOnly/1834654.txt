The 11.5-kDa Zn(2+)-binding protein (ZnBP) was covalently linked to Sepharose. Affinity chromatography with a cytosolic subfraction from liver resulted in purification of a predominant 38-kDa protein. In comparable experiments with brain cytosol a 39-kDa protein was enriched. The ZnBP-protein interactions were zinc-specific. Both proteins were identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Experiments with crude cytosol showed zinc-specific interaction of additional enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. From liver cytosol greater than 90% of the following enzymes were specifically retained: aldolase, phosphofructokinase-1, hexokinase/glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and most of triosephosphate isomerase remained unbound. From L-type pyruvate kinase only the phosphorylated form seems to interact with ZnBP. Using brain cytosol hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, and aldolase were completely bound to the affinity column, whereas glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and most of triose-phosphate isomerase remained unbound. The behavior of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from this tissue could not be followed. A possible function of ZnBP in supramolecular organization of carbohydrate metabolism is proposed.
