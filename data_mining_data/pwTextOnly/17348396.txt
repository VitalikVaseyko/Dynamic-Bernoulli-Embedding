A Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Ter mechanism of formation of two dead-end complexes was proposed to describe the experimental data on the functioning of E. coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). A kinetic model for the enzyme functioning was constructed, which assumes that it is regulated through reversible phosphorylation by its kinase/phosphatase, which in turn is regulated by IDH substrates and central metabolites such as pyruvate (Pyr), 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), and AMP. It was shown using the model that increasing the concentration of these effectors results in an increase of the active part of IDH, thus leading to an increase in the Krebs cycle flux. We predict that the ratio of the phosphorylated and free forms of IDH (IDHP/IDH) is more sensitive to AMP, NADPH, and isocitrate concentrations than to Pyr and 3-PG. The model allows a realistic prediction of changes in the IDHP/IDH ratio, which would occur under changes of biosynthetic and energetic loading of the E. coli cell.
