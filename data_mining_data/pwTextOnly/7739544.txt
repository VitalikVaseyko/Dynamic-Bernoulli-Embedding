The GCR1 gene product is required for maximal transcription of yeast glycolytic genes and for growth of yeast strains in media containing glucose as a carbon source. Dominant mutations in two genes, SGC1 and SGC2, as well as recessive mutations in the SGC5 gene were identified as suppressors of the growth and transcriptional defects caused by a gcr1 null mutation. The wild-type and mutant alleles of SGC1 were cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of the SGC1 gene product includes a region with substantial similarity to the basic-helix-loop-helix domain of the Myc family of DNA-binding proteins. The SGC1-1 dominant mutant allele contained a substitution of glutamine for a highly conserved glutamic acid residue within the putative basic DNA binding domain. A second dominant mutant, SGC1-2, contained a valine-for-isoleucine substitution within the putative loop region. The SGC1-1 dominant mutant suppressed the GCR1 requirement for enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, and pyruvate kinase gene expression. Expression of the yeast enolase genes was reduced three- to fivefold in strains carrying an sgc1 null mutation, demonstrating that SGC1 is required for maximal enolase gene expression. Expression of the enolase genes in strains carrying gcr1 and sgc1 double null mutations was substantially less than observed for strains carrying either null mutation alone, suggesting that GCR1 and SGC1 function on parallel pathways to activate yeast glycolytic gene expression.
