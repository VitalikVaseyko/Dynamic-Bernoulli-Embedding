Preparations of purified and disrupted suspensions of Coxiella burnetii are able to incorporate ribonucleotides into polymers in the presence of adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine triphosphates. Nucleotide incorporation requires the presence of all four ribonucleoside triphosphates. The reaction is enhanced by the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvic kinase, and exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid, and is inhibited by deoxyribonuclease and actinomycin D. Incorporation is maximal between pH 7.0 and 8.0, and at 37 C. The synthesized polymer is relatively insensitive to deoxyribonuclease and is sensitive to ribonuclease and dilute alkaline hydrolysis. The data indicate the presence of an autonomous deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase in the rickettsial agent.
