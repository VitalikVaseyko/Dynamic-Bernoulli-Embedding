Human red cell contain soluble adenosine-3',5'-phosphate-dependent protein kinases, which are able to phosphorylate the L' subunits of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase. Efficiency and maximum level of phosphorylation are very comparable in human liver and red cells. Phosphorylation of red cell pyruvate kinase results in the same kinetic modifications as for liver enzyme, namely a shift towards a 'T' allosteric state characterized by a decreased affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate and increased inhibition by the allosteric inhibitors ATP and alanine. In the course of red cell aging a small amount of partially proteolysed pyruvate kinase, devoid of the phosphorylatable site, appears; it resembles the subtilisin-treated L'4 enzyme and accounts for less than 20% of total pyruvate kinase subunits. Endogenous phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase from erythrocytes incubated in the presence of cyclic nucleotides produces the same kinetic modifications as phosphorylation in partially purified extract; this, however, does not change glucose consumption, lactate production and glycolytic intermediate concentrations of the incubated cells.
