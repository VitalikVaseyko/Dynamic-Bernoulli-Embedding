Intact rat liver cells from the perivenous region were isolated by collagenase perfusion after first destroying the periportal region by a brief portal infusion of digitonin. Periportal cells were isolated after retrograde digitonin infusion. Significantly higher alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activities and lower glutamate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase activities in periportal than in perivenous cells demonstrate marked separation. The high yield allows further characterization in vitro of the cell populations.
