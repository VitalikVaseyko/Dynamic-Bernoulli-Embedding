BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of chronic cardiac failure (CCF) on circulating plasma concentrations of tumour metabolic marker dimeric pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK). METHODS: Fifty patients with clinically stable CCF were studied. Patients with a history of past or ongoing malignancy were excluded. Dimeric M2-PK was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in EDTA plasma. RESULTS: Dimeric M2-PK concentration increased significantly (P = 0.005) with increasing clinical severity of CCF as assessed by the New York Heart Association classification grade. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cardiac failure results in an increased circulating plasma concentration of M2-PK, probably related to increased glycolytic flux. The physiological significance of the results is at present unclear but may relate to maintaining a balance between energy production and the supply of glycolytic intermediates to maintain synthetic processes. The results of this investigation will also have significance in the clinical interpretation of M2-PK concentrations.
