1) In intact Ehrlich ascites tumour cells the anaerobic glycolytic flux rate and pattern of intermediates have been investigated at different pH values of the extracellular medium. 2) As predicted from the dependence of the lactic acid dehydrogenase equilibrium on pH a strong negative correlation between log ([lactate]/[pyruvate]) and pH has been found. 3) The steady state fluxes of glycolysis at pH 8.0 and 7.4 are rather equal, despite significant differences in the intracellular concentrations of glycolytic intermediates. At pH 8.0 the concentrations of ATP, glucose 6-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate are lower, and the concentrations of ADP, AMP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, triose phosphates, phosphoglycerates, and phosphoenolpyruvate are higher than at pH 7.4. 4) From the analysis of the pH dependent changes of metabolites it follows that different mechanisms are responsible for maintaining equal actual activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase at pH 7.4 and 8.0. 5) From an application of the linear theory of enzymatic chains and a calculation of the control strength of the regulatory important enzymes results that hexokinase is evidently rate-limiting for glycolysis, and phosphofructokinase is also significantly influencing the glycolytic flux. Pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, on the other hand, do not significantly affect the rate of the overall glycolytic flux in ascites.
