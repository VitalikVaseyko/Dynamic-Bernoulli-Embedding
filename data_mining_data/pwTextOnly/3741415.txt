In lymphocytes of the rat, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and NADP+-linked malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) are distributed almost exclusively in the cytosol whereas pyruvate carboxylase is distributed almost entirely in the mitochondria. For NAD+-linked malate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase approximately 80% and 40%, respectively, are in the cytosolic compartment. Since glutaminase is present in the mitochondria, glutamine is converted to malate within the mitochondria but further metabolism of the malate is likely to occur in the cytosol. Hence pyruvate produced from this malate, via oxaloacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, may be rapidly converted to lactate, so restricting the entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria and explaining why very little glutamine is completely oxidised in these cells despite a high capacity of the Krebs cycle.
