50 cc of a 6%, oxygenated or non oxygenated stroma-free heamoglobin solution was transfused in rabbits after previous removal of about one third of the circulating blood volume. The experimental investigations were carried out on animals under barbiturate anaesthesia. Oxygen consumption was determined using a Warburg microrespirator. Posthaemorrhagic hypotension developing after bleeding caused a significant increase in oxygen consumption by liver tissue. Transfusion of non oxygenated stroma-free haemoglobin solution caused a further increase of oxygen consumption, while transfusion of oxygenated stroma-free haemoglobin solution slightly decreased oxygen consumption compared to the values observed during the post haemorrhagic hypotension.
