Certain phosphocreatine preparations contain a contaminant that inhibits phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase assays. The contaminant can be separated from phosphocreatine by anion exchange chromatography. After appropriate purification, phosphocreatine has no effect on phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase; thus, there is no evidence that it serves muscle as a regulator of these enzymes. Although the inhibitory preparations of phosphocreatine contain inorganic phosphate and trace amounts of more negatively charged phosphorylated contaminants, the inhibitor is not inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate. The nature of the inhibitor remains to be determined.
