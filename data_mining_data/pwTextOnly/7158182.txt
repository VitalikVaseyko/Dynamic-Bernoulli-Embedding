A rare case of congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency is reported. Of particular interest is the never before in the literature mentioned complication of migratory phlebitis and acute thrombosis of the left lower limb associated with trophic changes of the foot. Arteriography disclosed thrombosis of all three calf arteries. The patient was treated by lumbar sympathectomy combined with streptokinase fibrinolysis and resulted in healing of the trophic changes. The distal location of the vascular lesions made direct vascular reconstruction illusory. Fogarty thrombectomy is not indicated either due to the thrombotic nature of the lesions in association with thrombocytosis.
