Various regulators of protein kinase activities were tested for their effects on the in vitro transfer of phosphate from [gamma-32P]ATP to four proteins of rat brain synaptic particulate preparations. One protein, of apparent molecular weight 44,000, accepted 32P in the presence of 8 mM EDTA and no added Mg2+. It was the major phosphoprotein of brain mitochondria. Its phosphorylation was inhibited by pyruvate and stimulated by K+, and it comigrated in electrophoretic gels with authentic alpha-subunit of pyruvate: lipoamide oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) (EC 1.2.4.1) from bovine heart. The major kinase acting on three proteins of apparent molecular weights 24,000, 21,000, and 19,000 was stimulated by Ca2+, by preincubation with phospholipase C, and by 12-tetradecanoyl 4-beta-phorbol 13-acetate. Phosphorylation of these lower-molecular-weight proteins was inhibited by ACTH1-24, by cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate, and by 50 microM trifluoperazine. The stimulatory effect of Ca2+ was antagonized by calmodulin. The kinase in question appears to be B-50 protein kinase or protein kinase C.
