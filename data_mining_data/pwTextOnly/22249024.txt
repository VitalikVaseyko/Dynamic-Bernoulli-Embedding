BACKGROUND: Poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofibers derived from a marine diatom have been used to increase cutaneous wound healing. These nanofibers exert their activity by specifically activating integrins, which makes them a useful tool for dissecting integrin-mediated pathways. We have shown that short-fiber poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofiber (sNAG) treatment of endothelial cells results in increased cell motility and metabolic rate in the absence of increased cell proliferation. RESULTS: Using a Seahorse Bioanalyzer to measure oxygen consumption in real time, we show that sNAG treatment increases oxygen consumption rates, correlated with an integrin-dependent activation of Akt1. Akt1 activation leads to an increase in the expression of the transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). This is not due to increased mitochondrial biogenesis, but is associated with an increase in the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), suggesting regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Blockade of fatty acid oxidation with etomoxir, an O-carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor, blocks the sNAG-dependent increased oxygen consumption. (3)H-palmitate uptake experiments indicate a PDK4-dependent increase in fatty acid oxidation, which is required for nanofiber-induced cell motility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply a linear pathway whereby an integrin-dependent activation of Akt1 leads to increased PGC-1alpha and PDK4 expression resulting in increased energy production by fatty acid oxidation.
