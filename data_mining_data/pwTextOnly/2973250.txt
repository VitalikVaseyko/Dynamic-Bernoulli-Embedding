Control of glycolysis during anoxia was investigated in five organs (heart, brain, liver, and red and white skeletal muscles) of the freshwater turtle, Pseudemys scripta, after 1 or 5 h of submergence in N2-bubbled water. Lactate was produced as the metabolic end product, with distinct organ differences in the amount (net lactate accumulation was 2.4-fold higher in brain than white muscle) and rate (lactate production in liver dropped 16-fold after the 1st h) of lactate accumulation. ATP and total adenylate contents of all organs were reduced (by 15-32%) after 1 h of submergence, but energy charge was maintained; after 5 h, adenylate contents had fully recovered. Changes in the levels of hexose and triose phosphate intermediates of glycolysis indicated an activation of glycolysis within the 1st h of anoxia exposure in brain, heart, and skeletal muscles. By 5 h, however, these were reversed, and a glycolytic rate depression was indicated, consistent with the overall metabolic rate depression accompanying long-term anaerobiosis in the turtle. Crossover analysis indicated glycolytic control at the pyruvate kinase reaction in all organs during both glycolytic activation and metabolic depression; regulatory control at the phosphofructokinase locus was primarily important only during glycolytic activation in heart and red muscle. The same analysis indicated a very rapid glycolytic inhibition in liver occurring within the 1st h of anoxia exposure; this allows glycogenolysis to be directed toward glucose export yielding the fermentative fuel used by other organs during anoxia.
