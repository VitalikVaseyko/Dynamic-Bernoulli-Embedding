The radioactive labeling of spectrin using the pentavalent complex of molybdenum-99 was applied to the study of membrane protein in pyruvate kinase deficient red cells. Compared to the control, the labeling profile of the enzymopathic red cell membrane proteins remained generally unchanged but the molybdenum uptake was found to depend largely on the reticulocyte count. This finding may reflect changes during the cell maturation.
