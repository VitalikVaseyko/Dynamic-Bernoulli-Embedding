We isolated a mouse homologue cDNA of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDK4) with differential mRNA display as an up-regulated gene in the hypertrophied ventricles of juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mice with systemic carnitine deficiency. The PDK4 mRNA level was 5 times higher in JVS mice than in control mice under fed conditions. After 24 h starvation, this level increased to 20 times in JVS and 7 times in control, compared with the control fed level. On the other hand, carnitine administration reduced the high level of PDK4 mRNA in JVS mice to the control fed level. In control mice, the change in PDK4 mRNA was inversely correlated with the change in PDH activity. In JVS mice, however, the PDK4 mRNA level was not always correlated with the active-form PDH level.
