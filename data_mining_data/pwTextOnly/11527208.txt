Recent advances in genetic technology have provided a new platform on which the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes is possible in a rapid and efficient fashion. To assess the differential expression of human genes during neuronal differentiation, we compared the transcript profiles of undifferentiated, partially differentiated, and fully differentiated NT2/D1 cultures with cDNA expression arrays. Approximately 75 genes (13% of the gene array pool) were differentially expressed during neuronal development of NT2/D1 cells. Genes coding for pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme, clathrin assembly proteins, calmodulin, fibronectin, laminin, thymosin beta-10, and many others were upregulated as NT2/D1 cells differentiated into neurons. In contrast, several kinases, phosphatases, and G-protein coupled receptor genes showed downregulation upon neuronal differentiation. The information provided here is an invaluable reference for characterizing the phenotype of these cells. This information can also be used in cell therapy and transplantation in which the graft microenvironment and interaction with the host tissue is crucial.
