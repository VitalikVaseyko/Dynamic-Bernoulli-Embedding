Transcription of hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene is cell type-specific and is under the control of various nutritional conditions. The L-PK gene contains multiple cis-regulatory elements located within a 170-bp upstream region necessary for these regulations. These elements can synergistically stimulate L-PK gene transcription, although their mechanisms are largely unknown. Because nuclear factor (NF) 1 family members bind to specific cis-regulatory elements known as L-IIA and L-IIB and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha binds to the adjacent element L-I, we examined the functional and physical interactions between these two transcription factors. Reporter gene assay showed that these two factors synergistically activated the L-PK promoter containing the 5'-flanking region up to -189. Although two NF1-binding sites are required for the maximum synergistic effect of NF1 family members with HNF1alpha, significant functional interaction between the two factors was observed in the L-PK promoter containing two mutated NF1-binding sites and also in the promoter containing only the HNF1alpha-binding site, raising the possibility that NF1 proteins function as HNF1alpha co-activators. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that both NF1 proteins and HNF1alpha bound to the promoter region of the L-PK gene in vivo. In vitro binding assay confirmed that NF1 proteins directly interacted mainly with the homeodomain of HNF1alpha via their DNA-binding domains. This interaction enhanced HNF1alpha binding to the L-I element and was also observed in rat liver by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Thus, we conclude that cooperative interaction between NF1 family members and HNF1alpha plays an important role in hepatic L-PK transcription.
