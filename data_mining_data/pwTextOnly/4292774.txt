1. The activities of some key enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were measured in embryonic chick, sheep and rat livers. 2. In chicken the activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are low, but those of glucose 6-phosphatase and fructose diphosphatase are very high; the converse situation exists in the rat (Burch et al. 1963), but in sheep the activities of both phosphofructokinase and fructose diphosphatase are high, and the activities of hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase are low. These findings are discussed in relation to carbohydrate metabolism in these embryonic livers. 3. The regulatory properties of fructose diphosphatase from the embryonic livers of these three species were compared with the properties of the enzymes from adult animals. The inhibitions by AMP and fructose diphosphate and the effects of Mg(2+) and pH on the activities of adult and foetal fructose diphosphatase are almost identical. 4. It is concluded that regulatory properties are characteristic of fructose diphosphatase from embryonic and adult tissue, and the importance of this in relation to enzyme development is discussed.
