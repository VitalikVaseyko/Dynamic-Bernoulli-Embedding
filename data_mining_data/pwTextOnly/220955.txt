31P n.m.r. spectroscopy was used to study the nucleotide kinetics of UDP-glucuronyltransferase and associated reactions in the liver microsomal fraction. The effects of Mg2+ and EDTA on these reactions were investigated qualitatively. It was found that the rabbit microsomal fraction has no nucleoside pyrophosphatase activity, that UDP was immediately hydrolysed and that it was released from the microsomal surface. Reverse glucuronyltransferase could be demonstrated. The results are discussed with reference to functional coupling of UDP-glucuronyltransferase to other enzymes and the effects of Mg2+ and EDTA on the system.
