Gibberellin (GA) is collectively referred to a group of diterpenoid acids, some of which act as plant hormones and are essential for normal plant growth and development. DNA microarray technology has become the standard tool for the parallel quantification of large numbers of messenger RNA transcripts. The power of this approach has been demonstrated in dissecting plant physiology and development, and in unraveling the underlying cellular signaling pathways. To understand the molecular mechanism by which GA regulates the growth and development of plants, with reference to the monocot model plant-rice, it is essential to identify and analyze more genes and their products at the transcription and translation levels that are regulated by GA. With the availability of draft sequences of two major rice types, indica and japonica rice, it has become possible to analyze global expression profiles of genes on a genome scale. In this review, the progress made in finding new genes in rice leaf sheath using microarray system and their characterization is discussed. It is believed that the findings made in this regard have important implications for understanding the mechanism by which GA regulates the growth and development of rice.
