A growing interest has emerged in the field of studying the cross-talk between cancer cell cycle and metabolism. In this review, we aimed to present how metabolism and cell cycle are correlated and how cancer cells get energy to drive cell cycle. Cell proliferation and cell death largely depend on the metabolic activity of the cell. Cell cycle proteins, e.g. cyclin D, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK), some pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, and P53 have been shown to be regulated by metabolic crosstalk. Dysregulation of this cross-talk between metabolism and cell cycle leads to degenerative disorder(s) and cancer. It is not fully understood the actual reason of aberration between metabolism and cell cycle, but it is a hallmark of cancer research. Herein, we discussed the role of some regulatory molecules relative of cell cycle and metabolism and highlight how they control the function of each other. We also pointed out, current therapeutic opportunities and some additional crucial therapeutic targets on these fields that could be a breakthrough in cancer research.
