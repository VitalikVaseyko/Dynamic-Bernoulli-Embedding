Pyruvate kinase of Rana ridibunda erythrocytes is one of the regulatory enzymes of glycolysis. PK was purified about 7800-fold. The purified enzyme showed on SDS-electrophoresis three protein bands with an apparent molecular weight of between 60 and 65 kD. The enzyme is subject to activation by FDP and to inhibition by ATP. It showed Km values for PEP and ADP of 0.095 and 0.98 mM respectively. It was activated by K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions whereas it was inhibited by Na+ ions. The role of PK of Rana ridibunda erythrocytes, as a key and rate controlling enzyme of the glycolytic flux is discussed.
