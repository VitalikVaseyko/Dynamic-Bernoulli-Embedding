Mitochondria from bovine hearts were fractionated by three different procedures and the fractions were characterized by marker enzymes. Highly purified outer membranes, membrane vesicles, and inner membranes, as well as two high-speed soluble fractions, were obtained. Azide (or oligomycin) resistant ATPase was not found to be a marker for outer membranes. The data were consistent with the association of the protein kinase activity with the soluble matrix of the mitochondria. Activity was highest with histone H2B as the substrate, with histone H1 next in preference. In contrast to the mitochondrial protein kinases studied previously, protamine, casein, and phosvitin were very poor substrates and there was no detectable phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Activity was stimulated by cAMP but not by cGMP, calmodulin, or phosphatidylserine--diolein, with or without Ca2+. Two cAMP-dependent isozymes were separated from the soluble fraction of the mitochondria by chromatography on DE-52 columns. Phosphorylation of histone H2B by the isozymes was inhibited by 98% by Kemptide.
