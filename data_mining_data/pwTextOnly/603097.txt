Congenital nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia (HA) in dogs of the Basenji breed is inherited as a simple, autosomal recessive trait. Previous results of pyruvate kinase (PK) assays suggest a causal relationship between the anaemia and PK deficiency in erythrocytes. In the present investigation assays of this enzyme have been performed on haemolysates from 45 Basenji dogs, comprising 3 anaemic and 42 non-anaemic individuals of which 13 were known heterozygotes. The PK activity in haemolysates from the 42 non-anaemic dogs exhibited a bimodal distribution corresponding to the genotypic classes: heterozygotes and normal homozygotes. The results indicate that heterozygotes have a partial, detectable enzyme deficiency, not reflected in clinical disease, and thus give evidence of a gene dosage effect in agreement with observations in man. The proposed genotypes PK PK, PK pk and pk pk refer to normal homozygotes, heterozygotes, and anaemic individuals, respectively. The findings strengthen the genetic hypothesis of recessiveness of the anaemia by direct detection of heterozygosity of parents of affected individuals. Moreover, the results are of value in comparative studies and they have practical application in connection with eradication programmes.
