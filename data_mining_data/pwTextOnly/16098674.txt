This study was conducted to explore the relationship between two isolates of Neospora caninum (N. caninum) (KBA-2 and VMDL-1) using proteomics. To achieve the goal, proteins of N. caninum tachyzoite lysates of KBA-2 and VMDL-1 were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), stained with silver-nitrate and analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to compare protein profiles. In addition, proteins separated by 2-DE were transferred to membranes, probed with bovine anti-N. caninum KBA-2 immunoglobulin G, and reactive proteins were visualized and compared between the two isolates. Most spots on 2-DE profiles and antigenic spots on 2-DE immunoblot profiles were located at similar locations in terms of isoelectric point and molecular weight. Proteins common to both isolates included the following: heat shock protein 70, subtilisin-like serine protease, nucleoside triphosphatase, heat shock protein 60, pyruvate kinase, tubulin alpha, tubulin beta, enolase, putative protein disulfide isomerase, actin, fructase-1,6-bisphosphatase, putative ribosomal protein S2, microneme protein Nc-P38, lactate dihydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase aldolase, serine threonine phosphatase 2C, 14-3-3 protein homologue, N. caninum dense granule-1 and NcGRA2. As a consequence, even though N. caninum KBA-2 and VMDL-1 isolates were isolated from geographically distinct locations there were significant homology in the proteome and antigenic proteome profiles. In addition, proteomic approach was verified as a useful tool for understanding of host immune response against different isolates of protozoa.
