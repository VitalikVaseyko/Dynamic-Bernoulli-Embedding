A new kolavic acid derivative known from spectroscopic analyses as monomethyl ester-15-kolavic acid was isolated from the stem bark of Entada abyssinica, a plant traditionally used in West and East Africa for the management of sleeping sickness. The new derivative showed a strong and selective inhibitory activity on the GAPDH enzyme of Trypanosoma brucei with an IC50 value of 0.012 mM.
