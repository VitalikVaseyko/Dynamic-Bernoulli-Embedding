Chicken embryos less than 15 days old contain only the K isozyme of pyruvate kinase, which appears to exist in vivo as an R,T conformational set with pI values of 7.2 and 6.6, respectively. Sets of lower pI and higher pI K-isozyme variants also are obtained. Whole embryos of 15 days or more of development show progressively increasing amounts of higher pI, lower K0.5S enzymatic variants. Tissue distribution and kinetic properties suggest that the highest pI form (pH 8.8-9.0) is an M-isozyme analogue. The intermediate forms are postulated to be hybrids. Adult liver extracts contain only the embryonic K isozyme; no evidence for an L-isozyme analogue was obtained. All major forms of the enzymes are compared with respect to saturation by phosphoenolpyruvate in the absence of effector and in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and/or Mg-ATP.
