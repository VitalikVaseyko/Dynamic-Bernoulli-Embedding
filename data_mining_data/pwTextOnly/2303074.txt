We report a longitudinal study of 41 patients with liver glycogenosis due to phosphorylase kinase deficiency. In their youth, patients displayed hepatomegaly (92%), growth retardation (68%), delayed motor development (52%), hypercholesterolaemia (76%), hypertriglyceridaemia (70%), elevation of glutamate pyruvate transaminase (56%) and fasting hyperketosis (44%). With age, these clinical and biochemical abnormalities gradually disappeared and most adult patients were asymptomatic.
