Stress conditions induced in rainbow trout a readjustment in the glucosensing response of the hypothalamus and hindbrain such that those sensors did not respond properly to changes in glucose levels, as demonstrated in previous studies. To evaluate the hypothesis that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) could be involved in that response, we have incubated the hypothalamus and hindbrain of rainbow trout at different glucose concentrations in the presence of different concentrations of CRF. Under those conditions, we evaluated whether parameters related to glucosensing [the levels of glucose, glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate, the activities of glucokinase (GK), glycogen synthase (GSase) and pyruvate kinase (PK), and mRNA abundance of transcripts for GK, Glut2, Kir.6-like and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)-like] are modified in the presence of CRF in a way comparable to that observed under stress conditions. We obtained evidence allowing us to suggest that CRF could be involved in the interaction between stress and glucosensing as CRF treatment of the hypothalamus and hindbrain in vitro induced a readjustment in glucosensing parameters similar to that previously observed under stress conditions in vivo. We had also previously demonstrated that stress elicits alterations in food intake in parallel with the readjustment of glucosensing systems. Here, we provide evidence that the mRNA abundance of several of the neuropeptides involved in the regulation of food intake, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) or cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), is affected by CRF treatment, in such a way that their expression does not respond to changes in glucose levels in the same way as controls, allowing us to suggest that the food intake response that is integrated by changes in those peptides and known to be reduced by stress could be also mediated by CRF action in glucosensing areas.
