1. An investigation of the reaction mechanism of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-activated pyruvate kinase isolated from the hepatopancreas of the crab Carcinus maenas was conducted. The enzyme was assayed in the presence of 500 microns-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 75 mM-KCl and 8 mM-Mg2+free at 25 degrees C. The results are consistent with a rapid-equilibrium random mechanism. 2. Evidence is presented that suggests the formation of two mixed-substrate-product dead-end complexes, enzyme-ADP-pyruvate and enzyme-ADP-ATP. 3. Competitive substrate inhibition was observed for both substrates, ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate, suggesting the formation of the complexes enzyme-ADP-ADP and enzyme-phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate in the suggested mechanism. 4. Data from the ATP product-inhibition studies indicate the formation of the complex enzyme-ATP-ATP. This suggests that in the reverse reaction ATP also will show substrate inhibition. 5. The presence of a saturating concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate does not cause full activation of the purified preparations of the enzyme. 6. Pyruvate kinase activity in the supernatant of a hepatopancreas homogenate was completely activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, suggesting that the binding of this ligand to the purified pyruvate kinase was impaired.
