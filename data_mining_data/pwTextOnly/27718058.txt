Mitochondrial structural and functional integrity defines the health of a cell by regulating cellular metabolism. Thus, mitochondria play an important role in both cell proliferation and cell death. Cancer cells are metabolically altered compared to normal cells for their ability to survive better and proliferate faster. Resistance to apoptosis is an important characteristic of cancer cells and given the contribution of mitochondria to apoptosis, it is imperative that mitochondria could behave differently in a tumor situation. The other feature associated with cancer cells is the Warburg effect, which engages a shift in metabolism. Although the Warburg effect often occurs in conjunction with dysfunctional mitochondria, the relationship between mitochondria, the Warburg effect, and cancer cell metabolism is not clearly decoded. Other than these changes, several mitochondrial gene mutations occur in cancer cells, mitochondrial biogenesis is affected and mitochondria see structural and functional variations. In cancer pharmacology, targeting mitochondria and mitochondria associated signaling pathways to reduce tumor proliferation is a growing field of interest. This chapter summarizes various changes in mitochondria in relevance to cancer, behavior of mitochondria during tumorigenesis, and the progress on using mitochondria as a therapeutic target for cancer.
