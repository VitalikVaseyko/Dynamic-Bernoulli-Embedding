Amyloid-beta peptide Abeta(25-35) was shown to cause lysis of rat erythrocytes of different ages. The toxicity of Abeta(25-35) positively correlated with both the erythrocyte age andthe peptide concentration. The activity of glycolytic, antioxidant, and Na+/K(+)-ATPase enzymes decreased with erythrocyte aging in vivo. In vitro Abeta(25-35) reduced the activity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione transferase and increased Na+/K(+)-ATPase activity in aged erythrocytes to a greater degree than in young cells.
