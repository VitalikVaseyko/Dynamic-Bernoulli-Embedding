A method for the isolation in high yield of intact chloroplasts from the unicellular green alga Dunaliella marina (Volvocales) is described. This procedure uses chemically induced lysis of cells with the polycationic macromolecules, DEAE-dextran (M=500,000) or poly-D,L-lysine (M=30,000-70,000). Reaction conditions were optimized with respect to obtaining a high yield of intact chloroplasts, after isopycnic centrifugation in a linear sucrose density gradient, by varying the concentration of polycation and the temperature and pH of incubation. Broken chloroplasts devoid of the stromal marker enzymes fructosebisphosphate phosphatase and ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, but containing mitochondrial (fumarase) and microbody (catalase) contamination, were banded at a bouyant density of 1.18 g cm(-3). Intact chloroplasts, as indicated by their retention of alkaline fructosebisphosphate phosphatase and ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase, were found in 30% yield (chlorophyll in intact cells, 100%) at an equilibrium density of 1.24 g cm(-3). Contamination by cytoplasmic material (pyruvate kinase), mitochondria, and microbodies was less than 8% each.
