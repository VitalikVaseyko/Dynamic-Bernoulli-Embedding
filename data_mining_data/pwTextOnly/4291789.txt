1. Rats of two strains were kept on three different diets; one was a commercial diet of rat pellets, one contained about 80% of sucrose and 20% of casein and was supplemented with corn oil, and the third was a similar diet without the corn oil. 2. On the commercial diet, the specific activities of pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in the livers of one strain of rats (strain A) were 1.5-3 times those in the other strain (strain B). When the diet high in sucrose and supplemented with corn oil was given, there were large increases in the specific activity of pyruvate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in the livers of strain A rats. With strain B rats the increases were much smaller. Omission of corn oil from the diet caused a threefold increase in the specific activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in strain B rats, but had little effect on other enzymes. 3. The enzymes of the kidneys and hearts of strain A rats were also more active than those of strain B rats. In strain A rats, the specific activities of pyruvate kinase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase in the kidney increased when the sucrose content of the diet was high, but in the kidneys of strain B rats there was little change. 4. In strain A rats, the specific activity of pyruvate kinase in the heart more than doubled with the high-sucrose-corn oil diet and increased threefold when corn oil was omitted. No changes were seen in strain B rats. 5. In strain A rats, omission of corn oil from the diet increased the ability of the kidneys to synthesize glucose from lactate. 6. In strain B rats, addition of corn oil to the diet resulted in a decrease in the liver in the specific activity of ATP citrate lyase and in the ability to incorporate acetate into lipid.
