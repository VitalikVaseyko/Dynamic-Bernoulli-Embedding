This study aims to demonstrate the effect of high glucose concentrations on NHE-1 and PK activities and investigate the implicated signal transduction pathways. Erythrocytes drawn from healthy volunteers were incubated in the presence of 5 or 50 mM of glucose, fructose, galactose or mannitol. When appropriate, specific inhibitors of NHE-1, PKC or p42/44 MAPK were used. Erythrocyte NHE-1 activity has been estimated by fluorometrical determination of the intracellular pH and quantification of sodium uptake using 22Na. Pyruvate kinase activity was measured by a NADH-lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic assay. p42/44 MAPK activity was assessed with a specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased concentrations of glucose but not galactose, fructose or mannitol enhanced erythrocyte NHE-1, PK and p42/44 MAPK activity. Inhibition of PKC, counteracted these effects of glucose. Similarly, inhibition of NHE 1 abolished the effect of high glucose on PK and p42/44 MAPK as well. Finally, inhibition of p42/44 MAPK also hindered the effect of glucose on NHE-1 and PK activities. The data of the present study indicate an acute effect of glucose on signal transduction pathways in human erythrocytes. This pathway involves NHE-1, PKC, and p42/44 MAPK. A positive feedback between NHE 1 and p42/44 MAPK is suggested.
