The hormonal regulation of L-type pyruvate kinase in hepatocytes from phosphorylase b kinase-deficient (gsd/gsd) rats was investigated. Adrenaline (10 microM) and glucagon (10 nM) each led to an inactivation and phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase. Dose-response curves for adrenaline-mediated inactivation of pyruvate kinase, phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase and the stimulation of gluconeogenesis from 1.8 mM-lactate were similar for hepatocytes from control and gsd/gsd rats. Time-course studies indicated that adrenaline-mediated inactivation and phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase proceeded more slowly in phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes than in control hepatocytes. The age-dependent change in the adrenergic control of pyruvate kinase was similar between control and phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes. Adrenaline, glucagon and noradrenaline activated the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and inhibited pyruvate kinase in phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes. Vasopressin (0.2-2 nM), angiotensin (10nM) and A23187 (10 microM) had no effect on the activity ratio of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or pyruvate kinase in these cells. It is concluded that phosphorylase kinase plays no significant role in the hormonal control of pyruvate kinase and that phosphorylation and inactivation of this enzyme results predominantly from the action of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.
