We examined in HepG2 cells whether glucose-induced changes in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity could be mediated by SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent histone/protein deacetylase that has been linked to the increase in longevity caused by caloric restriction. Incubation with 25 vs. 5mM glucose for 6h concurrently diminished the phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr 172) and ACC (Ser 79), increased lactate release, and decreased the abundance and activity of SIRT1. In contrast, incubation with pyruvate (0.1 and 1mM) for 2h increased AMPK phosphorylation and SIRT1 abundance and activity. The putative SIRT1 activators resveratrol and quercetin also increased AMPK phosphorylation. None of the tested compounds (low or high glucose, pyruvate, and resveratrol) significantly altered the AMP/ATP ratio. Collectively, these findings raise the possibility that glucose-induced changes in AMPK are linked to alterations in SIRT1 abundance and activity and possibly cellular redox state.
