OBJECTIVES: Three luting cements based on zinc oxide phosphate, glass ionomer or composite resin were compared with respect to their influence on the anaerobic fermentation of sucrose by human oral bacteria. METHODS: Fifteen standardized samples of each of the three luting cements were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored for 72 h at 37 degrees C in distilled water, which was also used as elution medium. After removing the samples solutions were incubated with human fasting saliva, sucrose and a bicarbonate buffer in a Warburg apparatus. Intermediary organic acids resulting from anaerobic fermentation of sucrose were quantified indirectly by manometric measurement of CO2, released from the buffer. RESULTS: The materials did not indicate either an accelerating or an inhibiting effect on the formation of organic acids from sucrose. CONCLUSION: In the case of bacterial microleakage along the interface between cavity and luting cement, an inhibition of acid induced dentin or enamel demineralisation--using the materials investigated--cannot be expected.
