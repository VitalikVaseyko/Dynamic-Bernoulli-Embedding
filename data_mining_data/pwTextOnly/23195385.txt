The effects of high concentrations of KCl and NaCl on the activity of PK from Porphyra umbilicalis were studied in crude extracts. The results indicate an inhibition of the enzyme by Na(+) and a considerable tolerance of the enzyme to K(+). This behaviour is interpreted as an adaptation to high K(+) and low Na(+) levels in the cytoplasm, which have been revealed in earlier studies.
