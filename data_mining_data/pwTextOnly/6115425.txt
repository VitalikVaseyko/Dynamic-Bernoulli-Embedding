The phosphoryl transferring enzymes pyruvate kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the pyrophosphoryl transferring enzyme PP-Rib-P synthetase utilize the beta, gamma bidentate metal--ATP chelate (delta-isomer) as substrate, as determined with substitution-insert CrIIIATP or CoIII(NH3)4ATP complexes. In addition, these enzymes bind a second divalent cation, which is an essential activator for pyruvate kinase and PP-Rib-P synthetase and an inhibitor of protein kinase. The enzyme-bound metal has been used as a paramagnetic reference point in T1 measurements to determine distances to the protons and phosphorus atoms of the bound nucleotide and acceptor substrates. These distances have been used to construct models of the conformations of the bound substrates. The activating metal forms a second sphere complex of the metal-nucleotide substrate on pyruvate kinase and PP-Rib-P synthetase while the inhibitory metal directly coordinates the polyphosphate chain of the metal-nucleotide substrate on protein kinase. Essentially no change is found in the dihedral angle at the glycosidic bond of ATP upon binding to pyruvate kinase (chi = 30 degrees), an enzyme of low base specificity, but significant changes in the torsional angle of ATP occur on binding to protein kinase (chi = 84 degrees) and PP-Rib-P synthetase (chi = 62 degrees), enzymes with high adenine-base specificity. Intersubstrate distances, measured with tridentate CrATP or beta, gamma bidentate CrAMPPCP as paramagnetic reference points, have been used to deduce the distance along the reaction coordinate on each enzyme. The reaction coordinate distances on pyruvate kinase (# +/- 1 A) and PP-Rib-P synthetase (not less than 3.8 A) are consistent with associative mechanisms, while that on protein kinase (5 +/- 0.7 A) allows room for a dissociative mechanism.
