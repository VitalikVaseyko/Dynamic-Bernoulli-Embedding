N-alpha-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) has anti-tumorigenic properties, but its direct cellular targets are unknown. Previously, we showed TPCK inhibited the PDKl-dependent AGC kinases RSK, Akt and S6K1 without inhibiting PKA, ERK1/2, PI3K, and PDK1 itself. Here we show TPCK-inhibition of the RSK-related kinases MSK1 and 2, which can be activated independently of PDK1. Mass spectrometry analysis of RSK1, Aktl, S6K1 and MSK1 immunopurified from TPCK-treated cells identified TPCK adducts on cysteines located in conserved activation loop Phenylalanine-Cysteine (Phe-Cys) motifs. Mutational analysis of the Phe-Cys residues conferred partial TPCK resistance. These studies elucidate a primary mechanism by which TPCK inhibits several AGC kinases, inviting consideration of TPCK-like compounds in chemotherapy given their potential for broad control of cellular growth, proliferation and survival.
