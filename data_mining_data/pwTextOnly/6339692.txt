This study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary vitamin E and synthetic antioxidants on prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis in isolated aorta segments and perfused hearts as well as thromboxane (TxA2) synthesis in thrombin-stimulated washed platelets. Weanling male New Zealand rabbits were fed a vitamin E-deficient basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with either all-rac-alpha-tocopherol acetate or propyl gallate or DPPD (N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine). After 30 days on the diet, plasma tocopherol level, pyruvate kinase and liver microsomal NADPH oxidase were determined. DPPD but not propyl gallate prevented the development of myopathy. None of the synthetic antioxidants could substitute for vitamin E in decreasing enzymatic lipid peroxidation. PGI2 release by the aorta was lowered in vitamin E deficiency and was highest with DPPD supplementation. In the Langendorff perfused heart, however, PGI2 release was highest in the vitamin E-deficient group, possibly due to cardiomyopathy. TxA2 synthesis by washed platelets challenged with thrombin was independent of the antioxidant status of the animal. The data showed that dietary antioxidants selectively affect eicosanoid synthesis in different tissues.
