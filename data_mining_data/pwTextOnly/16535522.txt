Our prior work revealed that compared to the case for glucose metabolism, increased carbon yield and nil acid formation result when Bacillus subtilis grows on glucose medium containing citrate. To scrutinize further how citrate addition may alter metabolic flux regulation and the degree that the observed carbon yield corresponds to the maximal value, experimental (by least-squares analysis) and optimal (by linear programming) fluxes and yields were contrasted. Networks with differing reaction routes, directionality constraints, and transhydrogenase activities were examined. To attain an elevated carbon yield, citrate-glucose utilization need not alleviate any stoichiometric constraints that can sometimes interfere with the attainment of network objectives. Rather, the high carbon yield and nil acid formation attained may be linked to restriction of glycolytic capacity, particularly at the level of pyruvate kinase, which is consistent with a hypothesized effect of coupled metal-citrate uptake. Allowing for malic enzyme activity, hexose monophosphate pathway cycling, and transhydrogenase activity may also lead to the flux distributions underlying the high carbon yield observed. Finally, the observed carbon yield corresponded well to the maximum yield provided by all the network alternatives examined. Collectively, these results suggest that (i) the observed carbon yield is essentially equal to the maximal values associated with plausible networks and (ii), as suggested by others, nonoptimal flux regulation may contribute significantly to apparent cellular maintenance requirements.
