5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAR) is known to stimulate rat liver 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the mammalian homologue of Snf1p in yeast, involved in derepression of glucose-repressed genes. We used AICAR to test if AMPK could also play a role in the regulation of glucose-dependent genes in mammalian cells. At a concentration which induces phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of HMG-CoA reductase, AICAR blocked glucose activation of three glucose responsive genes, namely L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), Spot 14 and fatty acid synthase genes in primary cultured hepatocytes, but was without any action on glucose phosphorylation to glucose 6-phosphate and on expression of PEPCK, albumin and beta-actin genes. AICAR was also found to inhibit activation of the L-PK gene promoter by glucose in transiently transfected hepatoma cells. Therefore our results suggest that AMPK is probably involved in the glucose signal pathway regulating gene expression in the liver.
