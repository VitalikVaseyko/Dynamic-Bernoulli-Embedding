This review deals with the biochemical-pharmacological actions of anthralin (dithranol) and with the various possibilities of regulating the disturbed metabolism in psoriasis. A close relationship exists between enzyme inhibition, blocking of nucleic acid metabolism, and cytostatic-cytotoxic actions exerted by anthralin. Special reference is made of the inhibitory capacity on important enzymes of the pentose phosphate shunt the importance of which is briefly outlined. In vitro experiments with dithranol confirmed clinical observations such as the advantageous application of anthralin together with ultraviolet light or the decreased efficacy of anthralin incorporated in plain zinc paste.
