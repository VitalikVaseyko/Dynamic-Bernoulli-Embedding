The effects of a high carbohydrate diet on the renal gluconeogenic and glycolytic capacities and on the activities of the main enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase have been studied. These parameters have been analysed in two separate and isolated fractions of the renal tubule, the proximal convoluted (PCT) and the distal convoluted (DCT) zones. The results presented in this study show a rapid adaptation capacity of the kidney in response to the high amount of dietary carbohydrate, which are characterized by a decrease in the glucose production and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity in the proximal tubules, and an increase in the glycolytic flux and phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities in the distal tubules. The changes in these enzyme activities took place only at subsaturating substrate concentrations and not at maximum velocity which suggest that they are probably due to an allosteric and/or covalent modifications and so, they are independent of variations in the cellular levels of the enzymes.
