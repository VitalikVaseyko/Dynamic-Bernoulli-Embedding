OBJECTIVES: To determine if measuring the ratio of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) to pyruvate kinase (PK) is more reliable than only measuring G6PD activity to identify heterozygous G6PD- individuals with associated microcytic anemia in the Calabrian population, which shows high frequencies of both the thalassaemia (thal) trait and G6PD deficiency. DESIGN AND METHODS: Measurement of G6PD and PK activities was carried out on 205 samples of whole blood from Calabrian subjects of both sexes (age range 10-50 years) using a double starter differential pH-metry technique. RESULTS: The G6PD/PK ratio is able to differentiate G6PD- heterozygous individuals from the normal population. G6PD/PK values also allowed us to easily identify the G6PD- heterozygous subjects with microcytic anaemia. Student's t test shows that G6PD/PK ratio is more reliable in both sample groups, relative to G6PD activity in normal subjects. CONCLUSIONS: G6PD/PK ratio is a reliable diagnostic parameter for mass screening for G6PD deficiency.
