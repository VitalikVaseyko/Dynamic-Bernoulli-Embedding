1. Temperature acts as a pyruvate kinase regulator in haematopoietic cells and erythrocytes. 2. Fructose-1,6-biphosphate and alanine act as allosteric modulators of pyruvate kinase in haematopoietic cells, while in erythrocytes although fructose-1,6-biphosphate exerts also allosteric effect, alanine appears to be a competitive inhibitor. ATP (1.0 mM) does not exert any clear effect on pyruvate kinase of both cellular populations. 3. The level of specific activity of pyruvate kinase in haematopoietic cells is 40-fold that of PK from erythrocytes.
