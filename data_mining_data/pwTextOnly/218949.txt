A series of synthetic peptide analogs of the cardiac troponin inhibitory subunit (TN-1) phosphorylation site sequence, Arg12-Pro-Ala-Pro-Ala-Val-Arg18-Arg19-Ser20-Asp21-Arg22-Ala, have been tested as substrates for the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37, ATP:protein phosphotransferase). As substrates, these peptides were generally inferior to the pyruvate kinase analog peptide Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly or its COOH-terminal amide analog. Replacing Arg-19 with alanine had only a minor effect on the kinetics of phosphorylation of the TN-1 peptide analog. In contrast, replacement of Arg-22 and Arg-18 with alanine resulted in marked enhancement and reduction of the Vmax, respectively. The results of this study have demonstrated that synthetic peptide analogs of the local phosphorylation site sequences of natural substrates may differ widely in their capacity to act as substrates for this protein kinase. In the case of the TN-1 peptide analogs, the contribution of the 4 arginine residues can be distinguished in terms of their influence on the kinetics of phosphorylation.
