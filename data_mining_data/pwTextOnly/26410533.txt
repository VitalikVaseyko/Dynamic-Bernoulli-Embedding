Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) is highly expressed in many solid tumors and associated with metabolism reprogramming and proliferation of tumors. Here, we report that PKM2 can bind to DNA Damage-Binding Protein 2 (DDB2), which is necessary for global nucleotide excision repair of UV induced DNA damage. The binding is promoted by UV irradiation and K433 acetylation of PKM2. Over expression of PKM2 facilitates phosphorylation of DDB2 and impairs DDB2-DDB1 binding. Furthermore, knocking down of PKM2 increases cell survival upon UV irradiation, while over expression of PKM2 reduces cell survival and over expression of DDB2-DDB1 reverts this effect. These results reveal a previously unknown regulation of PKM2 on DDB2 and provide a possible mechanism for UV induced tumorigenesis.
