In a study of the interactions between glycolytic enzymes and cytoskeletal structure, the effect of increasing the degree of molecular crowding by the addition of protein was studied. This treatment resulted in an increased degree of binding of all the glycolytic enzymes, but with the most marked increases occurring with phosphofructokinase, enolase and pyruvate kinase. The significance of this data has been discussed in relation to the relative affinities of interaction of the individual components, the influence of molecular crowding and the physiological significance of this phenomenon.
