Activated mouse spleen lymphocytes have increased amounts of the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. No changes were found in hexokinase and in the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. Concanavalin A-activated T cells give higher activities of those enzymes than lipopolysaccharide-activated B lymphoblasts. Insulin treatment results in a stronger increment of the enzyme activity of mitogen-activated cells. Insulin inhibits the initial proliferation induced by either Con A or LPS, but a 50% increase in antibody-forming cells was found in LPS-treated cultures. Insulin may favour the differentiation of activated cells by increasing the rate of the glycolytic pathway.
