The human pyruvate kinase L/R-gene has been completely sequenced in unrelated normal individuals and in pyruvate kinase-deficient patients by a PCR-based direct genomic sequencing approach and analyzed for polymorphisms. The total length of the gene is 8409 nucleotides. Four polymorphic sites have been detected: C/A1705 and C/T1992 in exon 12, a T-stretch in intron 1 occurring in the two polymorphic forms (T)10 and (T)19 and an (ATT)n microsatellite in intron J which has been found in the variation (ATT)11-17. Haplotype analysis using these four markers has been applied to trace the genetic background in PK-deficiencies. The results support the idea of a single origin of most of the individual PK-mutations.
