Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is asymptomatic in heterozygotes, but it can lead in homozygous neonates to a severe neonatal hemolysis, sometimes life-threatening. We report five cases, with a 1- to 17-month delayed diagnosis, highlighting the need to measure PK activity in neonates and parents in case of an hemolysis at birth.
