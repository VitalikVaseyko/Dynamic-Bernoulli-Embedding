A method is suggested for determining the activity of pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate-phosphotransferase). The method is based on evaluation of the amount of ATP formed in the course of phosphoenolpyruvic-to-pyruvic acid transformation in the presence of ADP and magnesium ions. The ATP amount in the reaction medium is determined by paper electrophoresis with subsequent spectrophotometry.
