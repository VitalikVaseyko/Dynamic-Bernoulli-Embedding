Rats were injected daily with isoproterenol (2 mg/kg of body wt) for up to five days, or their incisor teeth were amputated on every other day for up to five amputations. The animals were subdivided in two subgroups killed 12 or 24 h after the first or last intervention. At 12 h all enzymes except hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PFK) showed decreased activities after isoproterenol. After incisor amputation, only increased HK and PFK activities were observed. With both procedures, there is activation of beta-adrenergic receptors but results show that different biochemical events take place, suggesting different mechanisms.
