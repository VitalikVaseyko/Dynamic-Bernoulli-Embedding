Cellular glucose-metabolizing enzymes and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) have been utilized as biochemical markers of mononuclear cell (MNC) leukemia maintained by serial cell transplantation in F344 rats. We have evaluated the sensitivity and reproducibility of these tumor markers in comparison to other diagnostic criteria of leukemia. Weanling rats were injected with 2 X 10(7) leukemic spleen MNC and sampled at 6, 35, 63, and 83 days. At 6 days, the glycolytic enzyme activities from spleen that decreased were believed to be residual activity from injected leukemic MNC. Glycolytic enzyme activities in spleen MNC were normal at 35 days and no changes in blood MNC enzyme activity occurred at 6 days or 35 days. At 63 days, prior to clinical evidence of leukemia, glucose-metabolizing enzymes from spleen MNC changed, and there were decreases in AChE from both blood and spleen MNC that progressively decreased at 83 days, when there was depressed body weight, splenomegaly, elevated WBC, depressed RBC, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated serum enzyme levels. Separation of leukemic MNC from blood and spleen enhances sensitivity of cellular enzyme responses and provides a reproducible model to study biochemical markers correlated with severity of leukemia.
