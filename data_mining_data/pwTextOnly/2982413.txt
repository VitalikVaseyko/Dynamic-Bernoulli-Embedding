Decavanadate inhibits hexokinase, adenylate kinase and phosphofructokinase; neither mono-, tri nor tetrameric vanadate anion is an inhibitor. Decavanadate inhibits phosphofructokinase obtained from bacterial and protistic sources. No form of vanadium(V) anion inhibits galacto-, glycero-, pyruvate and creatine kinase, or inorganic pyrophosphatase. Decavanadate appears to be a non-competitive inhibitor of both hexokinase substrates.
