Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) is inhibited by phenethylbiguanide. The kinetics of inhibition are competitive between biguanide and divalent, but not monovalent, metal cation activators of the enzyme; biguanide inhibition thus resembles inhibition by Ca(++). Alteration of either the polar or nonpolar portion of the phenethylbiguanide molecule quantitatively reduces its effectiveness as an inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, but the kinetics of inhibition remain qualitatively unchanged. Measurements of [(3)H]phenethylbiguanide binding to the enzyme indicate the presence of a single class of about 12 binding sites per enzyme molecule; binding characteristics are not significantly different in the presence of either monovalent or divalent metal cations. Studies with (45)Ca(++) and (54)Mn(++) demonstrate about 4 metal binding sites per enzyme molecule; phenethylbiguanide displaces these metal cations from the enzyme. Studies with several enzymes, dependent upon divalent metal cations, of both metal-bridge and substrate-bridge classes fail to show significant inhibition except at much higher phenethylbiguanide concentrations.
