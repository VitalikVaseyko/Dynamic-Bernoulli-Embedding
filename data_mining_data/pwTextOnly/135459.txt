By addition of enzyme the control intensity was determined on the pacemaker enzymes hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, as well as on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase and the pyruvate kinase with a control intensity of almost 0 in ultrasonic hemolysates from erythrocyte concentrate. This hemolysate approximately reflects the conditions existing in the intact cell with regard to glycolytic rate, ATP supply, and metabolite concentration. It is therefore suitable as a cell model, excluding the membrane, for studying inner control factors. For HK, PFK, GAPD, and PK predictions based on the linear glycolytic model about the significance of these enzymes for the regulation of the glycolytic rate could be confirmed.
