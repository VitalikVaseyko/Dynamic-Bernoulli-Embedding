A 26-year-old girl with muscle phosphorylase deficiency had exercise intolerance and experienced an occasional "second wind" phenomenon. Muscle glycogen concentration was about three times the normal level, whereas each glycolytic intermediate below the phosphorylase step was equivalent to only 10% of a normal level. Semi-ischemic forearm exercise tests disclosed no elevation of the venous lactate or pyruvate level, but they showed remarkable increases of serum creatine kinase and ammonia. Glucagon administration markedly augmented exercise tolerance. Forearm exercise after glucagon injection significantly increased venous lactate. Thus, the beneficial effect of glucagon is attributable to blood glucose utilization by muscle.
