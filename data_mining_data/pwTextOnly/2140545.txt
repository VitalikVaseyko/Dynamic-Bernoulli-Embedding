1. The regulatory properties of phosphofructokinase (PFK) has been investigated in two cellular population representatives of trout haemopoiesis; haemopoietic cells (capable of replication and differentiation) and erythrocytes (highly specialized cells). 2. The intracellular levels of substrates and effectors have been quantified and their effect on PFK activity determined. 3. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate anc cyclic AMP show a higher activation of the PFK from haemopoietic cells than the enzyme from erythrocytes. 4. AMP and phosphoenolpyruvate act as activators of the haemopoietic cell PFK while for erythrocytes PFK, AMP is an inhibitor and phosphoenolpyruvate does not display any effect. 5. Citrate inhibits PFK activity from haemopoietic cells but was not assayed in erythrocytes since it was not detected in these cells. 6. The differences in PFK regulation in both cellular populations may be attributed to the intracellular levels of the effectors and/or different isoenzymatic patterns. 7. The different regulation of PFK together with the higher enzymatic activity of PFK and pyruvate kinase from haemopoietic cells are related to the higher glycolytic flux that exhibits the haemopoietic cells. 8. The results shown in this investigation allow us to conclude that PFK has a specific role depending on the energetic requirements of the cellular population in which the enzyme is present. 9. The requirements are related to the physiological function of each type of cell.
