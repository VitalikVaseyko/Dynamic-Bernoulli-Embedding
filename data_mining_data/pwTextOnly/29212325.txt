We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which chronic heat stress impairs the breast-meat quality of broilers. Broilers were assigned to three groups: the normal control (NC) group, heat-stress (HS) group, and pair-fed (PF) group. After 7 days of heat exposure (32 degrees C), the high temperature had caused oxidative stress; elevated the activity of citrate synthase (CS), the mRNA expression of M-CPT1, and the phosphorylation level of AMPKalpha; and reduced the mRNA expression of avUCP. After 14 days of heat exposure, the heat stress had increased the lightness and drip loss and decreased the pH and shear force of the breast meat. Additionally, the heat exposure had increased the mRNA expressions of FAS, ACC, and PDK4; the content of lipids; and the activities of lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and it had decreased the mRNA expression of M-CPT1 and the activity of CS. In conclusion, chronic heat stress impairs meat quality by causing mitochondria to malfunction and affecting energy-substance aerobic metabolism, resulting in increased glycolysis and intramuscular fat deposition.
