Myocardial substrate metabolism and enzyme release following hypothermic potassium cardioplegia with and without the addition of mannitol in the cardioplegic solution were studied in two series of patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement. Measurements were made of PO2. O2-saturation and content, PCO2, pH, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) simultaneously in arterial and coronary sinus blood before cardioplegia and during the first 60 min after the release of aortic cross-clamping. In addition, myoglobin and enzymes were followed in peripheral venous blood for 72 hours after cardioplegia. Analysis of the results revealed no striking difference between the groups. Nevertheless, with the addition of mannitol, there was a slightly lower release of lactate and myoglobin probably indicating a more rapid metabolic recovery of the myocardium.
