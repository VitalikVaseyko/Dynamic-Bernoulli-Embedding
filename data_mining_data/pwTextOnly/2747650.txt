We have previously shown that the SIS/platelet-derived growth factor B chain contains a nuclear targeting signal near its C terminus. Here we show that the platelet-derived growth factor A chain also contains a nuclear targeting signal encoded by an exon which is subject to alternative splicing. This sequence is capable of targeting a nonsecreted form of the A chain to the nucleus and can also target the cytoplasmic proteins dihydrofolate reductase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and pyruvate kinase to the nucleus.
