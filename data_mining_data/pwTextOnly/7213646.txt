Effect of several phosphoenolpyruvate analogs on the activity of enoylpyruvate (phosphoenolpyruvate: UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 2-enoyl-1-carboxyethyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.7) transferase was examined. The results suggest that the phosphoenolpyruvate binding site of the transferase is very similar to that of pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40). Evidence is presented to show that the binding of UDP-GlcNAc to the transferase enhances the reactivity of the active site SH group.
