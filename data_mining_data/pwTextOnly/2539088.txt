The activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase and of PDH kinase activator protein (KAP) were increased 2-2.4-fold during 25 h of culture of hepatocytes from fed rats with glucagon plus n-octanoate. PDH kinase activity in hepatocytes from starved rats (initially 2.2 x fed control) fell during 25 h of culture in medium 199 (to 1.5 x fed control), but was maintained by glucagon plus octanoate. Dibutyryl or 8-bromo cyclic AMP increased PDH kinase activity 2-2.2-fold in hepatocytes from fed rats, but phenylephrine and isoproterenol (isoprenaline) were without effect. Insulin blocked the action of glucagon to increase PDH kinase activity and decreased the effect of octanoate and octanoate plus glucagon. It is suggested that the effects of starvation to increase activities of PDH kinase and of KAP in liver are mediated by alterations in circulating concentrations of glucagon, fatty acids and insulin and in hepatic cyclic AMP.
