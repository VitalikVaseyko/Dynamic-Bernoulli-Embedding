Sequential changes in the expression of two glucose transporter isoforms (GLUT1, GLUT2), and in the activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and malic enzyme during the development of rat renal basophilic cell tumors were studied using histochemical techniques. Early basophilic cell tubules are similar to proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) in their overall histochemical pattern, particularly in the expression of glucose transporters, suggesting that basophilic cell tubules and tumors derived from them arise from PCT. In comparison with PCT, basophilic cell tubules show slightly increased activities of all the enzymes studied. In basophilic cell tumors, markedly elevated hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities are accompanied by a considerable reduction in the expression of GLUT2. GLUT1 expression is not found in basophilic cell tubules or PCT. Small basophilic cell tumors also do not express GLUT1, but GLUT1 is regularly expressed in several cell layers surrounding necrotic areas within large basophilic cell tumors. Our results indicate that increased glycolytic activity and reduced GLUT2 expression take place during the development of renal basophilic cell tumors.
