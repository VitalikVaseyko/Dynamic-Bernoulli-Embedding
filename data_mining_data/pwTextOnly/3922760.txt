The non-invasive technique of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance was applied to study glucose metabolism in vivo in the insect parasite Crithidia fasciculata. It was found that under anaerobic conditions [1-13C]glucose underwent a glycolytic pathway whose main metabolic products were identified as [2-13C]ethanol, [2-13C]succinate and [1,3-13C2]glycerol. These metabolites were excreted by C. fasciculata into the incubation medium, while in the cells [3-13C]phosphoenolpyruvate was also detected in addition to the aforementioned compounds. The C3 acid is apparently the acceptor of the primary CO2 fixation reaction, which leads in Trypanosomatids to the synthesis of succinate. By addition of sodium bicarbonate to the incubation mixture L-[3-13C]malate was detected among the excretion products, while the ethanol:succinate ratio of 2.0 in the absence of bicarbonate changed to a ratio of 0.6 in the presence of the latter. This was due to a shift of the balance between carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate, leading to succinate, and pyruvate decarboxylation leading to ethanol. The addition of 25% 2H2O to the incubation mixture led to the formation of [2-13C, 2-2H]ethanol derived from the prior incorporation of 2H+ into pyruvate in the reactions mediated by either pyruvate kinase or malic enzyme. However, no 2H+ incorporation into L-malate was detected, excluding the possibility that the latter was formed by carboxylation of pyruvate, and lending support to the idea that L-malate results from the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The formation of [2-13C, 2-2H]-succinate under the same conditions reflected the uptake of 2H+ during the reduction of fumarate. When the incubations were carried out in the presence of 100% 2H2O, several [1-13C, 1-2H]ethanol species were detected, as well as [2-13C, 2-2H]malate and [1,3-13C2, 1,3-2H2]glycerol. The former deuterated compounds reflect the existence of NAD2H species when the incubations were carried out in 100% 2H2O, while the incorporation of 2H+ into [1,3-13C2]glycerol must be attributed to the phosphoglucose-isomerase-mediated reaction during glycolysis.
