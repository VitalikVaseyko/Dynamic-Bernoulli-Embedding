A perifusion system for primary cultures of hepatocytes is described. The system accommodates 20 rotated petri dishes (60 mm) and allows individual medium composition and sampling for each dish. Cell number and insulin (15 pM to 7.7 nM) were stable in the system for at least 24 h. The dose-response relationship for induction by insulin of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase was shifted to the left by a factor of 9 and 5, respectively, as compared to conventional, stationary cultures. The system is useful for studies at low and/or constant concentrations of substrates, hormones, growth factors, etc., with monolayers of cells having a high metabolic capacity.
