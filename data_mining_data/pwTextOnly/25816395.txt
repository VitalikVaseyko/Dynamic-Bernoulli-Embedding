Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia due to abnormalities in either insulin secretion or action. A range of vanadium complexes have been synthesized and demonstrated to be effective in lowering hyperglycemia. Thiamine administration was also reported to prevent deterioration in fasting glucose and insulin levels, and to improve glucose tolerance in hyperglycemic patients. This study has been conducted to evaluate the ionic vanadyl(II) thiamine hydrochloride complex (VC) as a new anti-diabetic candidate. The new complex was characterized by infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), electronic spectra, magnetic susceptibility, electron spin resonance (ESR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The anti-diabetic effect of VC was investigated in comparison to vanadium sulfate in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with VC versus vanadyl sulfate showed a more potent effect on reducing serum glucose and cholesterol close to normal levels. VC suppressed the diabetes-induced upregulation of hepatic glucose transporter (GLUT)-2, Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) more significantly than vanadyl sulfate. Either vanadyl sulfate or VC restored hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factor-1c (SREBP-1c) and muscle hexokinase (HK) mRNA expression that was downregulated in diabetic group. Pyruvate kinase (PK) mRNA expression was restored more significantly in VC-treated than vanadyl sulfate-treated diabetic rats. These results indicate that the newly synthesized VC could be an effective anti-diabetic candidate as the anti-diabetic activity of the ionic vanadium was enhanced after being modified with the organic ligand, thiamin. The results also suggest that VC achieves its effect most likely through modulating the transcription of energy metabolizing enzymes.
