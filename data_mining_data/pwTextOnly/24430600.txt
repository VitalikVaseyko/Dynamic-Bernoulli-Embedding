Crude extracts of dark-kept resting cells of a chlorophyll-free, carotenoid-containing mutant of Chlorella vulgaris Beijerinck (211-11h/20) were found to convert 14.44+/-0.77 nmol PEP per min and mg protein into pyruvate by the action of pyruvate kinase (=PK; EC 2.7.1.40). When such cells were exposed to blue light (lambda<550 nm, approximately 300 muW cm(-2)) for 3 hrs the PK-activity/protein of their crude extracts rose to 21.47+/-1.30, i.e., it was enhanced by 43%. Poisoning with 10(-3) mol cycloheximide or with 150 mug actinomycin D/ml prevented the effect of blue light by 80-90% (Table 1). This result points to an induction of enzyme synthesis in blue light. Addition of 1% glucose in the dark resulted in an increase in PK-activity, too. Three hrs after application of glucose the PK-activity was 28.05+/-1.88 nmol/min and mg protein, which was 94% greater than in the control. The effect of glucose was also largely preventable by cycloheximide (10(-3) mol) or by actinomycin D (150 mug/ml) (Table 2). These results lead to the conclusion that blue light may induce the synthesis of PK by supplying free sugars at the site of enzyme synthesis. The assumption is supported by the observation that in hot water extracts of blue illuminated cells in which glucose oxidation had been poisoned by. 10(-2) mol monoiodoacetic acid there was 60% more glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate and sucrose detectable than in extracts of equally poisoned algae from darkness (Table 3). It is suggested that blue light activates a system for the transport of sugar out of the chloroplast, which results in the induction of respiratory enzyme synthesis and thus in enhanced respiration.
