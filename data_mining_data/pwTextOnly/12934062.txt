Cortical neurons rapidly die in necrosis due to poor glucose uptake in the low-density (LD) culture under serum-free condition without any supplements. The scanning and transmission electron microscopical analyses characterized the necrosis by membrane disruption, mitochondrial swelling and loss of cytoplasmic electron density. High-glucose treatment delayed the neuronal death by suppressing necrosis, but induced apoptosis through increase in Bax levels, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and DNA ladder formation. Although pyruvate as well as high glucose inhibited necrotic cell death and rapid decrease in cellular ATP levels, possibly related to decreased [(3)H]-2-deoxy glucose uptake under the serum-free condition, it did not induce apoptosis. Protein kinase C inhibitors blocked these changes related to the cell death mode switch. Several neurotrophic factors did not affect the necrosis, but potentiated high-glucose-induced survival activity, while inhibiting cytochrome c release. All these results suggest that high-glucose treatment causes neuronal cell death mode switch by inhibiting necrosis, while inducing apoptosis, which is prevented by neurotrophic factors.
