We describe a method for the detection of isoforms of several glycolytic enzymes by activity staining after native PAGE. The staining is based on coupled enzyme assays carried out on the gel after electrophoresis and is linked to the disappearance of NADH, which is visualized by fluorescence. This method offers reliable and sensitive detection for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase from plant tissues. It can be applied to the detection of all enzymes which are normally detected spectrophotometrically using coupled enzyme assays consuming NAD(P)H.
