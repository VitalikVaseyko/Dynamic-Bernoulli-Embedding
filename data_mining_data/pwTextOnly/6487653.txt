The effects of natural aliphatic polyamines on basal and hormone-stimulated protein phosphorylations in hepatocytes were studied. Cells isolated from adult rats were incubated in suspension with [32P]orthophosphate, in the absence or presence of polyamines at varying concentrations and for different times; hepatocytes were then exposed to various hormones for 10 min. Phosphoproteins contained in total cell lysates were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Spermine, the most effective amine, decreased the basal level of phosphorylation of proteins with 46, 34 and 22 kDa, and increased that of a 18 kDa protein. These effects, maximal with an external concentration of 7.5-10 mM, were detectable after a lag period of about 10 min and reached a plateau after 45 min. Pretreatment of cells with the polyamine almost completely prevented stimulation of the phosphorylation of the 46 and 34 kDa proteins by insulin; in contrast, the effects of phenylephrine on the same proteins were only partly inhibited, whereas those of glucagon appeared largely unaffected. The major polyamine effect observed in intact cells (i.e., decreased phosphorylation) could be reproduced in a cell-free system where no kinase activity persisted. Indeed, spermine added directly to cell extracts strongly accelerated dephosphorylation of the 46 kDa protein and also of the 61 kDa protein identified as pyruvate kinase; furthermore, restoration of the activity of this enzyme occurred concomitantly with dephosphorylation of the 61 kDa protein in the presence of spermine.
