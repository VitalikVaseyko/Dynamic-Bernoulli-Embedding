Goldfish injected with cadmium chloride synthesized metallothionein. Ten days after the first injection, cadmium reached a maximum in the metallothionein peak (2 micrograms/ml) obtained after gel filtration of liver cytosol. Pyruvate kinase activity was inhibited from the beginning of the experiment; after the fourth day, the enzyme activity again started to increase but did not reach the control level. Alkaline phosphatase and fructose biphosphatase did not show any apparent inhibition. From the results here reported, a detoxifying role of metallothionein could be suggested.
