The oncogenes MYCN and survivin (BIRC5) maintain aggressiveness of diverse cancers including sarcomas. To investigate whether these oncogenes cooperate in initial malignant transformation, we transduced them into Rat-1 fibroblasts. Indeed, survivin enhanced MYCN-driven contact-uninhibited and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Importantly, upon subcutaneous transplantation into mice, cells overexpressing both instead of either one of the oncogenes generated tumors with shortened latency, marked anaplasia and an increased proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio resulting in accelerated growth. Mechanistically, the increased tumorigenicity was associated with an enhanced Warburg effect and a hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha linked vascular remodeling. This cooperation between MYCN and survivin may be important in the genesis of several cancers.
