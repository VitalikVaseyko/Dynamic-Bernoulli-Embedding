The effects of methotrexate, actinomycin-D and cyclophosphamid on oxygen consumption, aerobic CO2-production and anaerobic glycolysis of human placentas from early pregnancy were studied on Warburg apparatus. All the mentioned cytostatic agents inhibited oxygen consumption. Aerobic CO2-production was increased by methotrexate and inhibited by actinomycin-D and cyclophosphamide, but blocking effect of the latter was only transitional. Anaerobic glycolysis was decreased continuously by actinomycin-D and cyclophosphamide, but methotrexate had decreasing effect only for a short time.
