Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays a pivotal role in the growth, survival and metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Here, we presented for the first time that tanshinone A inhibited human esophagus cancer cell growth through miR-122-mediated PKM2 down-regulation pathway. Tanshinone A inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase in human Ec109 cells. As expected, tanshinone A down-regulated PKM2 mRNA and protein expression in Ec109 cells. Given these findings, we further investigated microRNAs regulation of PKM2 and confirmed miR-122 for targeting PKM2. Moreover, we found that tanshinone A-induced up-regulation of miR-122 expression inhibited PKM2 expression in Ec109 cells. Meanwhile, tanshinone A inhibited proliferation through miR122-medated PKM2 down-regulation. It was demonstrated that the anticancer activity of tanshinone A was targeted at metabolic regulation of miR-122/PKM2 in human esophagus cancer cells. Taken together, our results revealed tanshinone A targeting at PKM2-mediated metabolic reprogramming play an important role in inhibition of esophageal cancer cell growth.
