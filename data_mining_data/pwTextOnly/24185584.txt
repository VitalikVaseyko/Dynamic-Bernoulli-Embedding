The antiproliferative and differentiation potential of anthocyanin-rich strawberry fruit crude extracts (SE) were investigated on B16-F10 murine melanoma cells. Treatment of melanoma cells with SE produced a remarkable reduction of cell proliferation, paralleled with both the lowering of the intracellular levels of polyamine, and the enhancement of tissue transglutaminase (TG2, EC 2.3.2.13) activity (used as a differentiation marker). To gain further insight into profiling altered protein expression as a potential biomarker of the SE action on melanoma cells, analysis of the proteomic profile was performed on the treated B16-F10 cells, compared to the control. Following SE treatment, 30 proteins resulted up-regulated, and 87 proteins were down-regulated. In particular proteins overexpressed in cancer cells, involved in tumor progression and metabolism, were down-regulated. The possibility that SE may affect the Warburg effect in B16-F10 melanoma cells is discussed.
