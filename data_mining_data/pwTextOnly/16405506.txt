Cerebral ischaemia is associated with brain damage and inhibition of neuronal protein synthesis. A deficit in neuronal metabolism and altered excitatory amino acid release may both contribute to those phenomena. In the present study, we demonstrate that both NMDA and metabolic impairment by 2-deoxyglucose or inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration inhibit protein synthesis in cortical neurons through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF-2), without any change in phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF-2alpha. eEF-2 kinase may be activated both by Ca(2+)-independent AMP kinase or by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Although NMDA decreases ATP levels in neurons, only the effects of 2-deoxyglucose on protein synthesis and phosphorylation of elongation factor eEF-2 were reversed by Na(+) pyruvate. Protein synthesis inhibition by 2-deoxyglucose was not as a result of a secondary release of glutamate from cortical neurons as it was not prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-(a,d)-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK 801), nor to an increase in cytosolic-free Ca2+. Conversely, 2-deoxyglucose likely activates eEF-2 kinase through a process involving phosphorylation by AMP kinase. In conclusion, we provide evidence that protein synthesis can be inhibited by NMDA and metabolic deprivation by two distinct mechanisms involving, respectively, Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent eEF-2 phosphorylation.
