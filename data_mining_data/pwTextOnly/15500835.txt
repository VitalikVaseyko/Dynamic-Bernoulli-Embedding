Plasma metabolites and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) concentrations and enzyme activities of some types of peripheral leucocytes were measured to clarify one aspect of the differences in nutrient metabolism between dogs and cats. There were no significant differences in plasma concentrations of glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids and IRI between dogs and cats. Higher total cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations were observed in feline plasma, and H/T ratio (HDL/total cholesterol concentrations) was significantly lower than that in canine plasma. The cytosolic activities of fructokinase (FK), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly higher and the activities of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) were significantly lower in feline leucocytes than those in canine leucocytes. Higher activities of FK, PK and G6PD, which regulate the rate of biosynthesis of fatty acids, may reflect the different characteristics in nutrient metabolism in feline tissues from canine tissues.
