Twenty-eight male subjects underwent a maximal exercise test on an ergometric bicycle, 13 untrained and 15 trained subjects. At rest and after this maximal exercise, indicated by the increase of the serum lactate and pyruvate acids, venous blood samples were taken to study the release of muscular enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, LDH, alpha HBDH, CPK, CPK MB) and myoglobin in the next 24 h (3 min, 30 min, 8 h and 24 h after the end of this test). The statistic analysis of the results shows significant increases in comparison with the values at rest, according to the enzymes and the groups of subjects, especially for CPK, SGOT, SGPT for which the results are homogeneous with a peak at the 3rd min and the 8th h in the three groups and for HBD and LDH in the groups of trained subjects. However these values remain most often within the normal limits. These results are compared with those of previous works on the same subjects.
