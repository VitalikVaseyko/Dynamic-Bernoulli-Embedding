BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cellular, immunological, and inflammatory response to retinal photocoagulation of intense rupture laser lesions as a model of retinal degenerative diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven C57BL/6 mice were irradiated using a 532-nm laser to induce 10 retinal burns per eye that ruptured Bruch's membrane. Blood was drawn from the saphenous vein before and 2 months after laser treatment. The serum was run on antigen microarrays with 85 molecular markers associated with retinal degenerative diseases. RESULTS: Rupture laser resulted in dramatic changes in the immunoglobulin reactivity of most inflammatory markers 2 months after laser injury. Approximately two-thirds increased expression and one-third decreased expression. Notable markers that were increased included complement C3, CRP, PKM2, and aldolase. CONCLUSION: Rupture laser injury causes a change in the serum inflammatory markers after 2 months similar to macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and cancer-associated retinopathy. This animal model could be used as a biomarker for disease stage and activity in retinal degenerations.
