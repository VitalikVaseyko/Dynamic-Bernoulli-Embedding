Echinococcus granulosus cyst wall exhibited activities of fumarate hydratase (FH), pyruvate kinase (PK), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) with 911-1433, 151-215, and 54-98U, respectively. The ratio of PK/PEPCK was 2.2-2.7, indicating that glycolysis is the main pathway of carbohydrate metabolism in the cyst wall. When infected mice were treated ig with mebendazole, albendazole or praziquantel at the respective daily dose of 25-50, 300, and 500 mg.kg-1 for 7-14 d, no apparent change of FH activity in the cyst wall was found, while PK and PEPCK activities in the cyst wall were markedly inhibited by mebendazole and albendazole. The inhibition rates of PK and PEPCK activities in mebendazole group were 85-88% and 90-92%, respectively, while in albendazole group were 55.3 and 71.6%, respectively. The results suggest that PK or PEPCK in the cyst wall may the important site attacked by effective anti-hydatid drugs.
