In mammalian cells, a growing body of evidence indicates a relationship between cellular redox balance and tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signalling. The phosphorylative cascade activated by extracellular signals is inhibited by reducing conditions and stimulated by oxidative stress, in particular at the level of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. The mussel Mytilus typically shows variations in antioxidant defence systems and decreases in glutathione content in response to both natural and contaminant environmental stressors. In isolated mussel digestive gland cells, both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) have been recently demonstrated to activate tyrosine kinase receptors leading to multiple responses; among these, stimulation of the key glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). The present study investigates the possible relationship between the tyrosine kinase-mediated metabolic effects of growth factors and cellular redox balance in mussel cells. The results demonstrate that the effects of growth factors on glycolytic enzymes were abolished by cell pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). On the other hand, in cells where the glutathione content and synthesis were lowered either in vitro (by cell pretreatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)), or in vivo (by mussel exposure to Cu(2+)) the metabolic effects of growth factors were unaffected. Moreover, the results show that, in both control and glutathione-depleted cells, growth factors can also regulate the level of glutathione apparently by modulating, via phosphorylative mechanisms involving MAPK activation, the activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), the rate limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis. Overall, this study extends the hypothesis that cell signalling is intimately related to redox balance in marine invertebrate cells.
