The metabolic effects of oxalate on pyruvate kinase were studied in intact human red blood cells and compared to the spontaneous modifications induced by congenital pyruvate kinase deficiency. In normal cells, oxalate (2-3 . 10(-4) M) produces a large increase of the monophosphoglycerates, phosphoenolpyruvate pool and decrease of pyruvate concentrations as a result of pyruvate kinase inhibition; it does not significantly modify 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level, ATP formation or overall glycolytic activity. Those effects of oxalate are not due to Mg2+ chelation. A similar metabolite pattern is observed in vivo in erythrocytes with congenital pyruvate kinase deficiency, in which ATP concentration and glycolytic activity are described. These cells are more sensitive to oxalate than normal ones. Results are discussed with reference to the rate-limiting character of normal or congenitally deficient pyruvate kinase.
