In platelets, agonists that stimulate phosphoinositide turnover cause the rapid phosphorylation of a protein of apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) 40-47,000, called P47, by protein kinase C (PKC). Diverse identities have been ascribed to P47 including lipocortin, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase, pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha subunit and an actin regulatory protein. We have isolated human P47 clones by immunological screening of a lambda gt11 complementary DNA library from HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line. P47 recombinants thus identified hybridized to a 3.0 kilobase (kb) messenger RNA in mature white blood cell lines; the same mRNA was induced in HL-60 cells during differentiation. A 1,050 base pair (bp) open reading frame that could encode a protein of Mr40,087 was confirmed by comparison with peptide sequences from platelet P47, and by expression of the putative recombinant P47 in E. coli and in vitro. The P47 sequence appears to have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, and is not similar to any other known sequence including human lipocortin and the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The P47 protein contains a potential Ca2+-binding 'EF-hand' structure and a region that strongly resembles known PKC phosphorylation sites.
