1. A pathway for the synthesis of hexose from succinate by Rhodospirillum rubrum is proposed. 2. With 2,3-(14)C(2)-labelled succinate and fumarate as substrates in experiments with chromatophores and a soluble enzyme fraction of R. rubrum it was found that the products of succinate metabolism by the extracts were the same as in whole cells. It was also found that the light-dependent oxidation of succinate was catalysed by the chromatophores, but that all the other enzymes involved were in the soluble fraction. 3. By using specific assays the presence of all the enzymes required for the proposed pathway was demonstrated in the extracts and their specific activities were measured. 4. The overall rate of succinate assimilation was measured manometrically. The activities of the enzymes assayed were sufficient to account for the overall rate of assimilation. It is concluded that the proposed pathway represents the major mechanism for synthesis of hexose from succinate in R. rubrum. 5. The formation of alanine and aspartate was observed in experiments with isotopically labelled substrates, and possible synthetic pathways for these compounds are discussed.
