The activity of the enzymes of glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase) and hexose monophosphate shunt (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) was determined in the eye tissues of the rabbit at different stages of ontogenesis. The activity of these enzymes in the retina was shown to be higher than in other eye tissues. In the uveal tract (iris, ciliary bodies, uvea) the activity of glycolytic enzymes changes with the age. The greatest changes in the activity of enzymes were found during the period of the opening of eyelids. The activity of the enzymes of hexose monophosphate shunt in the eye tissues increases with the age. The relative activity of dehydrogenases of the hexose monophosphate shunt after the establishment of visual function is, however, not high and does not exceed that of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase in the eye tissues of the rabbit.
