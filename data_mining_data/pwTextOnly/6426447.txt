Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii , L. lactis and L. plantarum contained a pyruvate oxidase for the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl phosphate and acetate. The presence of an acetate kinase converted the acetyl phosphate to acetate. L. casei and L. plantarum produced lactate and acetoin, in addition to acetate, under the conditions used while L. casei also produced diacetyl. L. casei and L. plantarum were the only species to utilize citrate. L. helveticus and L. helveticus subsp. jugurti did not utilize pyruvate under the conditions used.
