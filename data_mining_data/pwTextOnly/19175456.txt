The study of physiological changes occurring during selection contributes to an improved understanding of relationships leading to efficiencies in animal production. To investigate the effects of food restriction in gastrocnemius muscle protein expression, 20% weight reduction was induced in New Zealand White (meat producing) and wild rabbits, using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. Lower expression levels of myosin heavy chains were found in the Wild Rabbits Restricted Group, while myosin light chain and alpha-crystallin proteins were not detected in restricted groups. Glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase expression levels were similar for all experimental groups. Phosphopyruvate hydratase beta was not detected in the wild rabbit restricted diet group. Pyruvate kinase levels were 50% lower in the New Zealand Restricted group. LIM protein detection was absent in the control New Zealand group. Results also show relevance of actin in preserving muscle structure in depressed food availability, the sensitivity of both myosin light chain and alpha-crystallin protein to restricted feed and the role of PK in the resistance of New Zealand rabbits to food restriction.
