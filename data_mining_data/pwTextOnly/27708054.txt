Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a metabolic hallmark of activated T cells and has been implicated in augmenting effector T cell responses, including expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), via 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-mediated mechanisms. Here, we show that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is induced in activated T cells to support aerobic glycolysis but promotes IFN-gamma expression independently of its 3'UTR. Instead, LDHA maintains high concentrations of acetyl-coenzyme A to enhance histone acetylation and transcription of Ifng Ablation of LDHA in T cells protects mice from immunopathology triggered by excessive IFN-gamma expression or deficiency of regulatory T cells. These findings reveal an epigenetic mechanism by which aerobic glycolysis promotes effector T cell differentiation and suggest that LDHA may be targeted therapeutically in autoinflammatory diseases.
