Nutritional myopathy has been induced in both rats and lambs by feeding diets low in selenium. The distribution of 45Ca, administered as 45CaCl2, has been examined firstly by autoradiography, and secondly by measuring the excretion of 45Ca in urine and faeces. Autoradiographs of skeletal muscle from unsupplemented animals showed radioactivity over discrete muscle fibres at a stage when no abnormalities were apparent using conventional staining techniques. Similar retention of 45Ca was found in some of the tubules in the kidneys of selenium-deficient rats. Total excretion in urine and faeces of lambs, examined for 48 h after intravenous administration of 45CaCl2, showed that in normal animals 18-6% of the dose was excreted, whereas in dystrophic lambs 12-0% was lost. The difference was significant at the 2% level. The respiratory rates of isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria, measured polarographically in the presence of glutamate and pyruvate as substrates, were low for dystrophic rats. Respiratory control indices were 1-0 for the same preparations but for supplemented rats they were all above 1-0. The differences in respiratory rates were significant at the 1% level. The major conclusion drawn from the results of these experiments is that one of the first effects of sleenium deficiency which can be visualized is the abnormal retention of calcium by individual muscle fibres.
