OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence and significance of gastric bypass surgery on hepatic gluconeogenesis in type 2 diabetic Goto Kakizaki(GK) rats. METHODS: Forty GK rats were randomly divided into Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group(group A) and sham operation group(group B). Differences in glucose tolerance experiment(OGTT) at preoperative and postoperative 1, 2 and 4 weeks were compared and weight was recorded. Glycated hemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively and 4 weeks postoperatively. The animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery and liver tissues were harvested to detect the relative expression of mRNA and protein of glucose 6 phosphatase(G-6-P) and phosphoenol pyruvate kinase(PEPCK) with RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Fasting blood glucose levels were 6.5, 4.9, and 4.7 mmol/L in group A, and were 10.3, 10.4, and 12.5 mmol/L in group B, and the differences between two groups were statistically significant(P<0.05). The blood glucose level at 2 h after stomach lavage were 8.3, 6.4 and 5.5 mmol/L in group A, and were 21.4, 23.8 and 24.7 mmol/L in group B at postoperative 1, 2, 4 weeks, and the differences between two groups were statistically significant(P<0.05). The glycosylated hemoglobin at postoperative 4 weeks was(6.8+/-1.0)%, significantly lower than that in group B[(7.9+/-0.8)%, P<0.05]. Hepatic G-6-P and PEPCK mRNA relative expression at postoperative 4 weeks was reduced by 21.0% and 25.9% respectively as compared to group B, and the protein expression reduced as well. Immunohistochemistry showed that hepatic glycogen sedimentary in group A increased significantly. CONCLUSION: The relative mRNA and protein level of key enzymes of hepatic gluconeogenesis are significantly decreased after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and hepatic gluconeogenesis is reduced, which may be a potential mechanism of the decrease of blood glucose.
