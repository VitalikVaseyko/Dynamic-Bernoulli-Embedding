Armored catfish (Liposarcus pardalis), indigenous to the Amazon basin, have hearts that are extremely tolerant of oxygen limitation. Here we test the hypothesis that resistance to hypoxia is associated with increases in binding of selected glycolytic enzymes to subcellular fractions. Preparations of isolated ventricular sheets were subjected to 2 h of either oxygenated or hypoxic (via nitrogen gassing) treatment during which time the muscle was stimulated to contract. The bathing medium contained 5 mM glucose and was maintained at 25 degrees C. Initial experiments revealed increases in anaerobic metabolism. There was no measurable decrease in glycogen level; however, hypoxic treatment led to a twofold increase in heart glucose and a 10-fold increase in lactate content. It is suggested that the increase in heart glucose content is a result of an enhanced rate of facilitated glucose transport that exceeds the rate of phosphorylation of glucose. Further experiments assessed activities of metabolic enzymes in crude homogenates and subsequently tracked the degree of enzyme binding associated with subcellular fractions. Total maximal activities of glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase [HK], phosphofructokinase [PFK], aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), and a mitochondrial marker, citrate synthase, were not altered with the hypoxic treatment. A substantial portion (>/=50%) of HK is permanently bound to mitochondria, and this level increases under hypoxia. The amount of HK that is bound to the mitochondrial fraction is at least fourfold higher in hearts of L. pardalis than in rat hearts. Hypoxia also resulted in increased binding of PFK to a particulate fraction, and the degree of binding is higher in hypoxia-tolerant fish than in hypoxia-sensitive mammalian hearts. Such binding may be associated with increased glycolytic flux rates through modulation of enzyme-specific kinetics. The binding of HK and PFK occurs before any significant decrease in glycogen level.
