A new spin-labeled derivative of ADP, 2-(4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl)thioadenosine-5'-diphosphate, has been synthesized. The compound causes both the reversible and irreversible phases of aggregation of human blood platelets at concentrations similar to those required for similar phases of aggregation by ADP itself. The spin-labeled ADP also rivals ADP as a substrate for pyruvate kinase. The interaction of intact human blood platelets and of isolated platelet membranes with the platelet-aggregating spin-labeled derivatives of ADP has been studied. The dramatic decrease in the ESR signal of the spin label is primarily due to chemical reduction of the nitroxide, rather than immobilization of the label. When platelets and spin-labeled ADP are mixed, a rapid burst of nitroxide reduction occurs, followed by a much slower reduction similar in time course to that seen for other spin labels. The rapid burst of reduction, but not the slow reduction, is inhibited by adenosine, an inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and by sulfhydryl-blocking agents. Experiments conducted with Ellman's reagent and platelet membranes or washed platelets revealed a 10 to 30% increase in the number of reactive membrane sulfhydryl groups when ADP was present. These results indicate that there is an increase in the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups on the platelet surface when platelets or membranes are stimulated by ADP.
