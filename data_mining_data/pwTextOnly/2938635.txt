Selected glycolytic enzymes (including phosphoglucose isomerase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase), as well as glycogen phosphorylase, creatine kinase, and adenylate kinase, bound to phosphofructokinase immobilized on an agarose gel. The affinity of phosphofructokinase to these various proteins differed, with phosphorylase exhibiting the strongest binding. Binding was reversed either by: (1) elution with high-ionic-strength buffer (0.4 M KCl); (2) the addition of a 5-10 mM concentration of ATP; or (3) high concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate (5 mM).
