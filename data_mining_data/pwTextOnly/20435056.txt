Catalysis by rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase involves domain movements and conformational changes induced by activating cations and its substrates. Fluorescence acrylamide quenching analyses reveal that interactions with Mg(2+) and K(+) lead to a more exposed active site of PK while interactions with PEP and ADP decrease solvent accessibility of the active site.
