In a stop-experiment using the hepatocarcinogen N-nitrosomorpholine, as well as glycogenotic and related lesions, hepatocellular foci with a different histochemical pattern were identified. The outstanding features of these hepatic foci, which may progress to hepatocellular adenoma, were increased activities of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mG3PD), glycogen synthase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphatase detected by enzyme histochemistry. Since no decrease in activity of any of the enzymes examined were seen in these foci, compared with normal liver, the term enzymatically hyperactive focus (EHF) is proposed for this type of lesion. Only at the stage of overtly nodular growth did these lesions exhibit some of the characteristic changes seen in nodules developing from glycogenotic foci, namely elevated activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and glutathione-S-transferase P as well as decreased activities of adenosine-triphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase and adenylate cyclase. Some of these enzymes have been used widely in morphometric studies as markers for preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. The inability to detect early EHF may lead to an underestimation of preneoplastic liver lesions in quantitative studies. Although there are apparent differences in the histochemical patterns of glycogen storing foci and early EHF, these differences tend to disappear during progression to overtly neoplastic lesions. In studies comparing the phenotypic alterations in different types of preneoplastic hepatic lesions, the recognition of EHF may contribute to the distinction of obligatory from facultative phenomena during transformation.
