The metabolic pathways by which the glycogen is utilized by fetal tissues is not well established. In the present study the ontogeny of seven key enzymes involved in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle has been established for rabbit fetal lung, heart, and liver. In the fetal lung the activities of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase increase from day 21 to 25. Thereafter the levels either drop to day 19 levels or do not change. The isocitrate dehydrogenase activity continues to increase from day 19 of gestation to maximum level on day 31 of gestation. In fetal heart the pattern of activity is similar, but in fetal liver most of the enzymes reach maximum levels earlier and, with the exception of pyruvate kinase, do not show a significant fall in activity near term. The pattern of development of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is different; maximum activity is observed on day 27 in fetal lung and heart and on day 21 in fetal liver. These results indicate that all three fetal tissues can oxidize glucose. Also, the accumulation of glycogen, particularly in fetal lung, appears to ensure that at specific times during gestation adequate quantities of energy (ATP) and substrates, required for surfactant phospholipid synthesis, are available independent of maternal supply of glucose or during brief episodes of hypoxia.
