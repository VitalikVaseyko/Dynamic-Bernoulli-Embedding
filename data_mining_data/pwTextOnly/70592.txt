In gliomas a shift was found in the composition of enzymes, manifested by abnormal inhibition of pyruvate kinase by alanine. This study demonstrates the appearance of the MII-type isoenzyme in various gliomas. This MII type is also found in meningiomas but not in normal brain tissue. The method of enzyme examination described may be valuable as a diagnostic aid in the surgery of gliomas.
