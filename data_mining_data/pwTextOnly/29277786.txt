BACKGROUND/AIM: It has been shown in many studies that expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme plays a key role during cellular metabolism. There is evidence that cancer cells manifesting very dynamic proliferation may control their division in various mechanisms, i.a. by expression of PKM2 isoform. The exact role of PKM2 in ovarian cancer (OC) cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have not been elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was focused on analysis of PKM2 expression in cancer cells and CAFs in 97 OC cases, mostly of serous histological type. Moreover, relationships between expression of PKM2 and proliferation (Ki-67; MCM-2, -3, -7; cyclin D1), vascular (CD31, D2-40) and mesenchymal (Vim and alphaSMA) markers as well as receptors (ER, PR, HER2, EGFR) were examined. All observations were evaluated in regard to available clinicopathological data. RESULTS: The expression of PKM2 was disclosed only in cytoplasm of OC cells. No statistically significant correlation between PKM2 and tested markers was found. In regard to available clinicopathological data only an increasing trend of PKM2 expression with increasing grade of histological malignancy G was found (p=0.07). CONCLUSION: Due to achieved results concerning expression of PKM2 there is a lack of evidence for its diagnostic and prognostic usage in OC.
