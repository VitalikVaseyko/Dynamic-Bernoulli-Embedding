Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities were studied in hemoglobin H (HbH) patients by spectrophotometric method, cytochemical method and the methemoglobin reduction (MR) test for the detection of heterozygous G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency was found in 7 of 64 cases (10.9%), including 3 cases of genotype alpha 1/alpha 2 and 4 cases of genotype alpha 1/CS. None of the HbH patients was found to be PK-deficient. Spectrophotometrically determined G6PD and PK activities were significantly higher in HbH patients than in normals (p less than 0.001), whereas the MR test yielded a significantly lower percentage of residual methemoglobin in HbH patients than in normals (p less than 0.05). All three methods were efficient in the detection of hemizygous G6PD deficiency in HbH patients, but not in G6PD-deficient females.
