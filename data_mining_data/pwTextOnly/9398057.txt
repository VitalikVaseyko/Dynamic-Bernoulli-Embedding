Transgenic mouse technology provides a direct genetic approach to in vivo carcinogenesis. In order to determine the oncogenic potential of an activated ras gene in liver, kidney and intestine, we created transgenic mice expressing the human H-ras oncogene under control of the L-type pyruvate-kinase gene. This gene is expressed in hepatocytes, enterocytes, proximal tubular cells of the kidney and endocrine pancreatic cells. Depending on lines, we observed hepatocarcinoma, polycystic kidney disease and an unexpected epididymis hyperplasia. These transgenic mice are an interesting model of polycystic kidney disease, and complete our study of the tissue-specificity of oncogene action.
