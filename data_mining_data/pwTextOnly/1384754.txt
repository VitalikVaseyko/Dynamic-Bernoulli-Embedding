Counter-current distribution in non charge-sensitive aqueous poly(ethylene glycol)-dextran two phase systems allows the fractionation of rat bone marrow cells into two broad cell subpopulations with different distribution coefficients in a relatively short time. Morphological identification and enzymatic studies suggest that erythroid cells are mainly present in the subpopulation with the higher distribution coefficient. The distribution coefficient and, therefore, surface hydrophobicity of these cells, apparently increase in parallel with an increase in their degree of differentiation and maturation.
