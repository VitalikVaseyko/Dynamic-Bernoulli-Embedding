Whole-body gamma-irradiation (1200 R) of female rats significantly increased liver glycogen and incorporation of glucose (U-14C) into liver fatty acids. Administration of cystamine before irradiation protected the enhanced lipogenesis from glucose (U-14C), but afforded only a partial protection of liver glycogen levels. Irradiation significantly decreased the activities of liver pyruvate kinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, and this decrease was not prevented by the administration of cystamine before irradiation. A significant increase in the activity of liver malate dehydrogenase (dehydrogenating) was noted in irradiated rats, which was not prevented by the administration of cystamine before irradiation. Irradiation did not affect the activities of combined hexose monophosphate pathway dehydrogenases and of malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating).
