Tetramethylpyrazine is the active ingredient of a Chinese herbal medicine. In this study, tetramethylpyrazine was tested for its activities in irradiated bone marrow stromal QXMSC1 cells. The proliferation of QXMSC1 cells was measured by MTS assay kit and flow cytometry. To identify proteins involved in the processes of cellular and molecular response of tetramethylpyrazine to irradiation damage, we comparatively analyzed the proteome of nonirradiated, irradiated and tetramethylpyrazine treated QXMSC1 cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to validate the differentially expressed proteins. 20 Gy 60Co gamma irradition inhibited QMSC1 cells growth and tetramethylpyrazine could reverse of this action due to stimulating QXMSC1 cells from G1 to S progression. Proteomic analytical results showed that 18 spots were changed in irradiated QXMSC1 cells, and 15 spots matched with known proteins after database searching. The expression level of proteins such as translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), and galectin-3, were increased in irradiated QXMSC1 cells, while calmodulin, pyruvate kinase were decreased. Tetramethylpyrazine could prevent this change or reverse to some degree. The function of these proteins involves in hematopoiesis, cell cycle and signal transduction. The changes of these proteins were confirmed by RT-PCR at mRNA levels. This study suggested that stimulating proliferation via tetramethylpyrazine played an important role in the cure effect on irradiated QXMSC1 cells and was helpful to deeply understand the mechanism of tetramethylpyrazine at the molecular level.
