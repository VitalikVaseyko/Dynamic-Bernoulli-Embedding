Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare yet fatal condition that is characterized by a continuous and notable elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), resulting in right heart failure and death. Pulmonary arterial remodelling does not result from abnormal proliferation of pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) but from pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (PAEC) dysfunction. However, the pathological mechanism of these two types of vascular cells in pulmonary artery remodelling is unclear. The Warburg effect describes aerobic glycolysis wherein cells commonly reprogram their energy metabolism to preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Recent research has demonstrated that the Warburg effect plays a significant role in the development of PAH, which involves the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs and endothelial dysfunction. This review attempts to illustrate the functions of the Warburg effect in PAH, which may provide a new therapeutic target for PAH treatment.
