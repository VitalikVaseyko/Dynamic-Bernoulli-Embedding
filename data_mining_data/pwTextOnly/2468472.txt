ADP ribosylation in the presence of cholera or pertussis toxin indicated the presence of G-proteins in Nb2 cell membranes. Two protein bands, with mol wt of 43.5K and 46.5K, were radiolabeled by cholera toxin, while a single protein (41.5K mol wt) was ADP ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Northern hybridization of total RNA from Nb2 cells with specific cDNA probes indicated the presence of mRNA transcripts encoding Gs, Gi2, Go, and, to a lesser extent, Gi3. A characteristic of receptors coupled to G-proteins is that their binding properties are regulated by guanine nucleotides. The binding of [125I]human GH to the lactogen receptor as well as the binding of [125I]IL-2 to the IL-2 receptor were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by GTP, GDP, and the analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). GMP, however, had no effect. The addition of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate to regenerate GTP from GDP greatly increased the apparent potency of GTP. Cholera toxin inhibited PRL- and interleukin-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the Nb2 cells. In contrast, pertussis toxin had a differential effect on PRL- and IL-2-stimulated cells. Pertussis toxin, at an optimal concentration of 0.01 ng/ml, significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of PRL on DNA synthesis (P less than or equal to 0.01; n = 9) and cell proliferation (P less than or equal to 0.05; n = 9) compared with the effect of PRL alone. However, at higher concentrations the toxin inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Complete inhibition was achieved with 1000 ng/ml toxin. In contrast to the biphasic effect on PRL-stimulated cells, pertussis toxin was only weakly inhibitory to cells treated with IL-2. At the highest concentration tested, pertussis toxin (1000 ng/ml) inhibited IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell growth by only 30-35%. (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) or methylxanthine (MIX; IC50 = 0.25 mM) also inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis. In the absence of mitogen, neither agent, from 0.0001-1 mM, had any effect on DNA synthesis. Similarly, IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis in Nb2 cells was inhibited by (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) or MIX (IC50 = 0.072 mM). However, MIX was approximately 3 times as potent in inhibiting the cell response to IL-2 as that to PRL. The susceptibility of Nb2 cells to both bacterial toxins suggests a role for G-proteins in regulating PRL- or IL-2-stimulated mitogenesis in these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
