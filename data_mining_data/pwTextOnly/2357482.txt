Pyruvate kinase studies in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage during in vitro differentiation have been performed using culture techniques on GM-CFC cells and a study has also been done in bone marrow cells. The enzyme exhibits biphasic behaviour with respect to both of its substrates in cells derived from in vitro cultures at 5 and 7 days of incubation period. However in bone marrow cells these kinetics are only observed for ADP. The different kinetic behaviour of pyruvate kinase toward Fru-1,6-P2, Ala, Phe and ATP in the three cellular populations allows us to conclude that the expression of pyruvate kinase is associated with the differentiation of these cells.
