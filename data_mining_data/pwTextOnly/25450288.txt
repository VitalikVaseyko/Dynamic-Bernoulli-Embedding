OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnosis value of tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) in stool as a biomarker for diagnosis of colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By searching the databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, China national knowledge Information and Wanfang, the diagnosis study related to tumor M2-PK in stool as a biomarker for diagnosis of colorectal cancer were screened and included in this study. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were calculated by stata 11.0 software. RESULTS: According to the including criteria, 14 trials including 1990 subjects were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled diagnosis sensitivity, specificity, +LR, -LR and area under curve were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.81), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79), 4.38 (95% CI: 3.27-5.88), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.23-0.34) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.834-0.89). No statistical publication bias was found in this study. CONCLUSION: Tumor M2-PK in stool can be a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer with relative high sensitivity and specificity.
