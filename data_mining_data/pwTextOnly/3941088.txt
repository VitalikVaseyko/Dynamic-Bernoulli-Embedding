The regulatory effects of alpha-ketoisovalerate on purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase were investigated. Incubation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex with 0.125 to 10 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused an initial lag in enzymatic activity, followed by a more linear but inhibited rate of NADH production. Incubation with 0.0125 or 0.05 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition, but did not cause the initial lag in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Gel electrophoresis and fluorography demonstrated the incorporation of acyl groups from alpha-keto[2-14C]isovalerate into the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component of the enzyme complex. Acylation was prevented by pyruvate and by arsenite plus NADH. Endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity was stimulated specifically by K+, in contrast to previous reports, and kinase stimulation by K+ correlated with pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation. Maximum kinase activity in the presence of K+ was inhibited 62% by 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate, but was inhibited only 27% in the presence of 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate and 0.1 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate. Pyruvate did not affect kinase inhibition by thiamin pyrophosphate at either 0.05 or 2 mM. The present study demonstrates that alpha-ketoisovalerate acylates heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and suggests that acylation prevents thiamin pyrophosphate-mediated kinase inhibition.
