The enzyme activities and isozyme distribution of the three glycolytic regulator enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were studied in lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Isozyme distribution patterns were determined by kinetic measurements, electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. The CLL lymphocytes were different from normal non-T lymphocytes with respect to hexokinase residual activity in the presence of glucose-1,6-P2, pyruvate kinase residual activity in the presence of alanine, and phosphofructokinase activity after stimulation by glucose-1,6-P2. No differences could be discerned in enzyme activities between the CLL and the normal T and non-T lymphocytes.
