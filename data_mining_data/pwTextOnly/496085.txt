The authors describe a critical study of two entirely enzymatic methods of determination of serum triglycerides which differ mainly by the choice of hydrolytic agents: esterase and hydrolase by the Roche methods, lipase and esterase in the case of the Boehringer method. The estimation of the resulting free glycerol requires 3 sequential enzymatic reactions (glycerol kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, ending by the measurement of the consumed reduced NAD. The study of the kinetics of the analysis in two stages is carried out using standard solutions of glycerol and with human sera of variable concentration; the optimal conditions of the reaction time and temperature are drawn up. The trials of repeatability and reproducibility from day to day were carried out together with evaluation of the precision. The method was compared with Beohringer's method (n = 50) using hydrolysis of alcoholic potash. The authors conclude on the use of the methods studied.
