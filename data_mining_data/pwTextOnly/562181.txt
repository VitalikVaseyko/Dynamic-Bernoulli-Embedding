(Z)-and (E)-phosphoenol-2-ketobutyrate were synthesized. [3-2H]-2-Ketobutyrates were formed from both isomers in the pyruvate kinase reaction in 2H2O and were converted to chiral propionates. Authentic (2S)-[2-2H]propionic acid was also prepared, and the optical rotatory dispersion curves of the propionates were compared. The rotation compared with standard propionate at 240 nm of sodium (2R)-[2-2H]propionate from the Z isomer was 47% (i.e., 53% was RS), and of (2S)-[2-2H]propionate from the E isomer was 29% (i.e., 71% was RS). Protonation at C-3 of the 2 si, 3 re face of the pseudosubstrates would have yielded (2R)- and (2S)-[2-2H]propionates from the Z and E analogues, respectively. An explanation offered for the nonstereoselective protonation that occurred is dissociation of the enol from the enzyme and subsequent random protonation in solution.
