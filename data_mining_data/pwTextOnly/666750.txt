Chronic (6 days) hyperinsulinaemia in young rats produced lower blood glucose concentrations and augmented body- and liver-weight gain. The insulin-treated rats had increased hepatic activities of citrate-cleavage enzyme, 'malic' enzyme and high-substrate (6.6 mM-phosphoenolpyruvate) pyruvate kinase, and decreased glucose 6-phosphatase. There were no changes in activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, phosphofructokinase, low-substrate (1.3 mM-phosphoenolpyruvate) pyruvate kinase, glucokinase and hexokinase.
