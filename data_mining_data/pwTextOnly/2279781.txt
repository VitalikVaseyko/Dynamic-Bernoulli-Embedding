Localization of different enzymes of PEP-succinate pathway has been done in Setaria cervi, a bovine filarial worm. Succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase were localized in mitochondria rich particulate fraction while all other enzymes were cytosolic. The in vitro effect of certain antifilarial/anthelmintic agents on these enzymes was also investigated. Sumarmin, at low concentration, could cause a marked inhibition of most of the enzymes of this pathway. Centperazine, an antifilarial drug being developed by CDRI showed significant inhibitory action on pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, fumarase and succinate dehydrogenase while CDRI compound 72/70 showed significant inhibition of PEP-carboxykinase activity. Diethylcarbamazine and levamisole, however, were found to be more or less ineffective at lower concentrations against all the enzymes of this pathway.
