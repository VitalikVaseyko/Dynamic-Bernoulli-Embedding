BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)delta has been considered a therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity through enhancement of fatty acid oxidation. The present study aimed to characterize the effects of PPARdelta agonists during insulin resistance of the whole body, muscle and liver. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Wistar rats and C57BL/J6 mice were fed a high fat diet (HF) and then treated with PPARdelta agonists NNC61-5920 and GW501516. The effects on insulin resistance were evaluated by hyperinsulinaemic clamp or glucose tolerance tests combined with glucose tracers. KEY RESULTS: In HF rats, 3 weeks of treatment with NNC61-5920 reduced the glucose infusion rate (by 14%, P < 0.05) and glucose disposal into muscle (by 20-30%, P < 0.01) during hyperinsulinaemic clamp. Despite increased mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and uncoupling protein 3 in muscle, plasma and muscle triglyceride levels were raised (P < 0.01). Similar metabolic effects were observed after extended treatment with NNC61-5920 and GW501516 to 6 weeks. However, HF mice treated with NNC61-5920 improved their plasma lipid profile, glucose tolerance and insulin action in muscle. In both HF rats and mice, NNC61-5920 treatment attenuated hepatic insulin resistance and decreased expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, fatty acid translocase protein CD36 and lipoprotein lipase in liver. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PPARdelta agonists exacerbated insulin resistance in HF rats in contrast to their beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome in HF mice. These opposing metabolic consequences result from their different effects on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of these two species.
