The effect of protein-free diet to decrease liver activity of branched-chain (-2-oxoacid) dehydrogenase (BCD) complex (active form) and increase BCD kinase activity was unaffected by preparation of hepatocytes, but partially reversed by 25 h of culture of hepatocytes in medium 199. Activation of BCD complex preceded loss of BCD kinase. The effect of culture on BCD complex was completely prevented by omission of branched-chain amino acids and partially prevented by 1 mM-alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate or 0.2 mM-pyruvate/2 mM-lactate. Protein-free diet decreased plasma branched-chain amino and oxo ('keto') acids and increased plasma pyruvate and lactate. It is concluded: (1) that branched-chain amino acids are involved directly in regulation of activities of BCD complex and BCD kinase; (2) that mitochondrial uptake of branched-chain oxo acids is necessary for regulation of BCD complex activity; and (3) that the stable increase in BCD kinase may function as a hysteresis mechanism.
