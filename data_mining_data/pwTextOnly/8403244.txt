We investigated whether the multiple pathophysiological signals generated in a peritonitis septic model alter the mRNA levels of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes, and whether these alterations are associated with glucose dyshomeostasis. Rats were sham-operated in the control group, and peritonitis sepsis was produced by a 1 cm cecal incision in the septic group. At 2, 4, and 6 hr post-surgery, total cellular RNAs were isolated from livers, and Northern blots performed to measure mRNA levels of aldolase B (ADL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucokinase (GK). Hepatic PEPCK enzymatic activity was measured by condensing 14CO2 with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form malate. Serum glucose concentrations were also measured. We found the following: At 2 hr of peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations, mRNA levels of all enzymes, and PEPCK enzymatic activity increased over control levels. At 4 hr of peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations and mRNA levels of GK and PK continued to increase; mRNA levels of all other enzymes, as well as PEPCK enzymatic activity decreased to or below control levels. At 6 hr of peritonitis sepsis, serum glucose concentrations, mRNA levels of all enzymes, and PEPCK enzymatic activity decreased to or below control levels. We concluded that sepsis affects mRNA levels of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes at the transcriptional level, and that these alterations are associated with glucose dyshomeostasis.
