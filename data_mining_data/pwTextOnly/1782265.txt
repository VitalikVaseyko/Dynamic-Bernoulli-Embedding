Regulation of respiration at all rates between State 4 and State 3 was studied in heart mitochondria oxidizing FAD- and NAD-dependent substrates (succinate, pyruvate + + malate and palmitoylcarnitine). The creatine phosphokinase ADP-regenerating system was used which allows to fix the concentrations of extramitochondrial adenine nucleotides in such a way that the rate of respiration is controlled by mitochondrial processes alone. It was shown that respiration is controlled by delta mu(H+)-utilizing system within the respiration rate interval from State 4 till 70-80% of the maximal rate in State 3 (corresponding to physiological rates) both for NAD- and FAD-dependent substrates. The main step in the control of respiration near State 4 is proton leakage through the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas in all the other parts of the mentioned interval this role is assigned to the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). The control coefficient for ANT is higher, while that of proton leakage is lower at the same relative rates of respiration with NAD-dependent substrates compared with succinate. These differences were found to be related to much higher values of the membrane potential generated at the same relative rates of succinate oxidation in comparison with the case with pyruvate + + malate. The contribution of delta mu(H+)-utilizing system to respiration control sharply decreases, whereas that of the delta mu(H+)-generating system increases at maximal rates of respiration near State 3. This phenomenon in more characteristic of succinate. In this case the control coefficient of ANT drops to zero, while that of succinate dehydrogenase rises to 0.7.
