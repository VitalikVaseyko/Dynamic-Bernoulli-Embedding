Various proteins/enzymes obtained commercially were tested for the presence of endogenously nitrated tyrosine by Western blot analysis omitting reducing agent in the step of SDS-PAGE. Histones II-S and VIII-S, IgG, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), phosphorylase b, and phosphorylase kinase exhibited strong immunoreactive bands. Histone VI-S, glycogen synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, actin, thyroglobulin, and macroglobulin exhibited moderate immunoreactivity. Histone III-S, casein, acetyl cholinesterase, DNase I, and lipase had only traceable immunoreactivity. Whereas histone VII-S, pyruvate kinase, trypsin, pepsin, chymotrypsin, protease IV, and protease XIII, and glutathione S-transferase lacked immunoreactivity. A variation of immunoreactivity between hypertensive and normaltensive rat hearts was found in the histone-agarose fractions of crude extracts. Additionally, nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity was observed in non-mammalian organisms including Eschericia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Triticum vulgaris. Upon the treatment of 15 microM peroxynitrite (PN), strong oxidant derived from nitric oxide (NO), the apparent Km of PKA for cAMP increased from approximately 10(-8) to 10(-6) M. The results imply that the varied nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins/enzymes may occur as a post-translational modification in vivo, and such discriminative nitration may be vital in PN/NO-regulated signal transduction cascade.
