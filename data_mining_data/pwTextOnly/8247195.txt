The oxidative injury to erythrocytes, red blood cell (RBC) rigidity and splenic hemolysis was assayed in 17 chronically hemodialyzed patients before and during recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) treatment. When a stable hematocrit between 30 and 35% had been established for at least 4 months, a statistically significant increase in RBC volume, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and several RBC enzymes (2,3-diphosphoglycerate, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase) was noted. This indicated significant RBC rejuvenation under the influence of EPO. However, no significant improvement in the RBC oxidative sensitivity, RBC deformability, splenic RBC volume, slow mixing splenic RBC volume, and the intrasplenic RBC transit time could be disclosed. These data confirm the existence of an extra-erythrocytic factor in uremic plasma, which is partly responsible for a reduced RBC life span in hemodialysis patients despite EPO treatment.
