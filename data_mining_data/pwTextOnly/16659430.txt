The dark respiration rate of discs from fully expanded tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum) increased linearly with decreasing diameter, the relative increase being independent of leaf age. The wound respiration responsible for this situation reached a plateau within 15 minutes of excision. Metabolite analysis gave evidence for two independent effects, also unrelated to age. The first was a forward crossover between phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate which was found as early as 1 minute after excision and persisted for up to 40 minutes. It was attributed to activation of pyruvate kinase by a changed ionic balance resulting from membrane damage, was accompanied by a reverse crossover between triose phosphates and 3-phosphoglycerate, and was localized in the outer region of the discs. The second effect was a rapid rise in hexose monophosphate and ATP levels throughout the discs. After 1 to 10 minutes the ATP/ADP ratio rose strongly for at least 3 hours; after 20 to 40 minutes there was net synthesis of adenine nucleotide as ATP. These results indicate that extrapolation from leaf discs to intact leaves is highly inadvisable.
