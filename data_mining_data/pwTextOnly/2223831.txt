Levels of all enzymes and metabolites involved in glycolysis were determined in suspension-cultured Catharanthus roseus cells. From both the maximum catalytic activities of the enzymes and comparisons of mass-action ratios with the apparent equilibrium constants for the reactions, it is concluded that the reactions catalysed by hexokinase, fructokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are far from equilibrium, whereas the other reactions including that catalysed by pyrophosphate-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, are close to equilibrium in vivo.
