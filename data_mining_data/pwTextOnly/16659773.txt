ATP inactivated plant pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) from broccoli (Brassica oleracea) mitochondria. ATP inactivation of the complex was time-dependent and proportional to the ATP concentration. Time-dependent incorporation of (32)P from [gamma(32)P]ATP into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein corresponded to the inactivation of the PDC. It is concluded that plant PDC is phosphorylated and inactivated by a PDC kinase.
