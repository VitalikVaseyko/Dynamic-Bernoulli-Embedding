Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity was measured in rat pancreatic islet cytosol and mitochondria. No carboxykinase activity was detected under a variety of conditions, including those that increase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in nonislet tissues, such as starving animals or incubating the islet extracts with Fe2+ or Mn2+ before assaying for enzyme activity. The amounts of islet cytosol protein used exceeded those of liver in companion assays used as controls. It was calculated that if islet phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity was 0.005 that of liver, or 1 X 10(-5) as high as pyruvate kinase activity in islets, it should have been detected in the assays used. Ferroactivator is a protein that permits Fe2+ to activate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and it is ubiquitous to many tissues that do and even do not contain the carboxykinase. Ferroactivator activity was not detectable in pancreatic islets. Pyruvate kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction that is essentially the opposite of that catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (i.e., phosphoenolpyruvate formation), is plentiful in islet cytosol. Therefore, even if phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity is present in pancreatic islets, it is so low that it is unlikely that phosphoenolpyruvate formation would be favored and the contribution of the carboxykinase to intracellular carbohydrate metabolism must be quantitatively unimportant.
