This comment argues against the view that cancer cells produce less entropy than normal cells as stated in a recent paper by Marin and Sabater. The basic principle of estimation of entropy production rate in a living cell is discussed, emphasizing the fact that entropy production depends on both the amount of heat exchange during the metabolism and the entropy difference between products and substrates.
