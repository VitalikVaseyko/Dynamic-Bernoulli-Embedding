Pyruvate was placed in experimental CPD-adenine (0.25 mM) blood preservative mixtures in four concentrations ranging from 40 to 320 mM. In the 320 mM pyruvate preservative, 2,3-DPG levels were elevated above normal for six weeks of whole blood storage at 4 C. The lower pyruvate concentrations maintained elevated or normal 2,3-DPG levels for less time: four weeks with 160 mM, two weeks with 80 mM, and one week or less with 40 mM or the control. ATP values were best maintained in the control. The higher pyruvate concentrations resulted in the most rapid decreases at ATP. However, even the 320 mM pyruvate did not cause ATP to fall below 2 microM/gm of Hb. The higher pyruvate concentrations produced and maintained a higher pH during storage. On the other hand, 2,3-DPG levels increased with pyruvate during the first week of storage when the pH was decreasing rapidly. This could be the result of its oxidation of NADH to NAD. The high pyruvate concentration which maintained elevated 2,3-DPG levels throughout the six weeks might be simulating the effect reported in pyruvate kinase-deficient red blood cells, in which blockage of glycolysis at that step is preventing 2,3-DPG catabolism.
