The abundance of mRNAs for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoenzymes in four brain regions of young (10 wk) and aged (50 wk) rats was investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNAs for PDK1, 2, and 4 were detected in all the regions examined. The level of PDK2 mRNA was the most abundant among the isoenzymes in all the brain regions when judged from the PCR cycles. The level of PDK1 mRNA was relatively high in cerebellum and cerebral cortex compared to medulla oblongata and hippocampus. Aging decreased the levels of mRNAs for PDK1 and 2 in cerebellum and increased the PDK2 mRNA in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The level of PDK4 mRNA was not affected by aging. These results provide the first evidence suggesting that there is the regional difference in the abundance of mRNAs for PDK isoenzymes in rat brain and that the levels of mRNAs for the isoenzymes were affected by aging.
