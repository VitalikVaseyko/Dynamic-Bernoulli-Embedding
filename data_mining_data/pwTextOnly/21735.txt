Two types of pyruvate kinases were found in Fusarium oxysporum. One type (inducible) was present mainly during the early stages of growth on glucose or sucrose and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine diphosphate. The major type (constitutive) was present under all conditions of growth and displayed in the absence of potassium ions, a sigmoidal substrate saturation curve when phosphoenolpyruvate was used as the variable substrate. In the presence of potassium ions the saturation curve for phosphoenolpyruvate exhibits a plateau at half-maximal velocity. The effects of various metabolites on the activity of the inducible and constitutive kinases were also studied. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate, cyclic AMP, acetyl CoA, tryptophan, and phenylalanine had no effect on the activity of the enzymes. Citrate was a potent inhibitor of the constitutive pyruvate kinase activity and increased the sigmoidicity of the saturation curve for phosphoenolpyruvic acid. In the presence of K+, the bimodal plot observed in the absence of citrate gradually changed to a hyperbolic shape as the concentration of citric acid was increased. In the presence of K+ and ADP as the variable substrate citric acid converted the hyperbolic plot to a sigmoidal one. Citrate had no effect on the inducible enzyme.
