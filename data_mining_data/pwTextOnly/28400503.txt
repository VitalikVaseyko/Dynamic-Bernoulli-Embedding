The purpose of the present study was to examine whether lack of skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) affects the switch in substrate utilization from a fed to fasted state and the fasting-induced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) regulation in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1alpha knockout (MKO) mice and floxed littermate controls were fed or fasted for 24 h. Fasting reduced PDHa activity, increased phosphorylation of all four known sites on PDH-E1alpha and increased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK4) and sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) protein levels, but did not alter total acetylation of PDH-E1alpha Lack of muscle PGC-1alpha did not affect the switch from glucose to fat oxidation in the transition from the fed to fasted state, but was associated with lower and higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in the fed and fasted state, respectively. PGC-1alpha MKO mice had lower skeletal muscle PDH-E1alpha, PDK1, 2, 4, and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP1) protein content than controls, but this did not prevent the fasting-induced increase in PDH-E1alpha phosphorylation in PGC-1alpha MKO mice. However, lack of skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha reduced SIRT3 protein content, increased total lysine PDH-E1alpha acetylation in the fed state, and prevented a fasting-induced increase in SIRT3 protein. In conclusion, skeletal muscle PGC-1alpha is required for fasting-induced upregulation of skeletal muscle SIRT3 and maintaining high fat oxidation in the fasted state, but is dispensable for preserving the capability to switch substrate during the transition from the fed to the fasted state and for fasting-induced PDH regulation in skeletal muscle.
