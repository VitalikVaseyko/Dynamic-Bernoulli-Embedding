Isorhamnetin is a flavonoid metabolite of quercetin and isolated from water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica, Umbelliferae). It has been reported that isorhamnetin exerts beneficial effects including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative activities. The present study investigated whether the antioxidant activity of isorhamnetin is correlated with its anti-cancer effects on colorectal cancer cells. Isorhamnetin significantly repressed cobalt chloride (CoCl2)- or hypoxia-induced hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) accumulation in HCT116 and HT29 cells. When compared with quercetin, isorhamnetin showed potent inhibition of HIF-1alpha. Moreover, it inhibited CoCl2-induced activity of hypoxia response element reporter gene and HIF-1alpha-dependent transcription of genes such as glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, carbonic anhydrase-IX, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Isorhamnetin also blocked hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced HIF-1alpha accumulation. The antioxidant effects of isorhamnetin were confirmed by observation of CoCl2- or H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Consistently, overexpressed HIF-1alpha was decreased by isorhamnetin or N-acetyl-L-cysteine in HEK293 cells. In vitro migration and invasion assay further confirmed the inhibitory effects of isorhamnetin on cancer cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that isorhamnetin inhibits ROS-mediated HIF-1alpha accumulation, which contributes to its anti-metastatic efficacy.
