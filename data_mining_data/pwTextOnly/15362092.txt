Attention is drawn to the feasibility of using isothermal calorimetry for the characterization of enzyme reactions under conditions bearing greater relevance to the crowded biological environment, where kinetic parameters are likely to differ significantly from those obtained by classical enzyme kinetic studies in dilute solution. An outline of the application of isothermal calorimetry to the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters is followed by considerations of the nature and consequences of crowding effects in enzyme catalysis. Some of those effects of thermodynamic non-ideality are then illustrated by means of experimental results from calorimetric studies of the effect of molecular crowding on the kinetics of catalysis by rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. This review concludes with a discussion of the potential of isothermal calorimetry for the experimental determination of kinetic parameters for enzymes either in biological environments or at least in media that should provide reasonable approximations of the crowded conditions encountered in vivo.
