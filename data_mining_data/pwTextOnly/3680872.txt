It has been demonstrated that young RBCs (reticulocytes and early mature erythrocytes) possess more insulin receptors than old RBCs (late mature erythrocytes) but it is not yet known whether insulin receptors on young and old RBCs are regulated similarly. In the present investigation insulin receptors on young and old RBCs have, therefore, been studied in five normal male subjects before and after 2 days dexamethasone ingestion (0.5 mg tablet every 6 h) and, in the same subjects, before and 5 h after ingestion of 75 g glucose. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that dexamethasone increases insulin receptor concentration while glucose ingestion increases both insulin receptor affinity and concentration on young RBCs. By contrast, neither stimuli modify insulin receptors on old RBCs. Studies on RBCs are usually performed on the whole RBC population not taking into account this differential responsiveness of receptors on young versus old RBCs; consequently, this phenomenon might be responsible of the fact that some data reported on RBCs are not in agreement with those reported on monocytes or adipocytes and it should be taken into consideration when using RBCs to evaluate insulin receptor regulation.
