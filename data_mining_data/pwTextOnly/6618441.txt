The influence of temperature, K+, Mg2+ and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate on human red cell pyruvate kinase was investigated. Kinetic measurements between 4 degrees C and 43 degrees C revealed a remarkable influence of the temperature on the allosteric behaviour of the enzyme. Below a transition region between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C (as obtained from an Arrhenius plot) the enzyme shows non-cooperative behaviour, as can be deduced from Michaelis-Menten, Hill and Scatchard plots. At temperatures above 20 degrees C cooperativity increases with rising temperature. This effect becomes even more pronounced at higher temperatures upon addition of increasing amounts of K+ and Mg2+ accompanied by a slight decrease of the reaction velocity. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, abolishes cooperativity at every temperature and salt concentration measured. Difficulties which arise in evaluating the correct values of V, Km and the Hill coefficient nH with cooperative systems are met by using a computer program of Wieker, Johannes and Hess, especially designed for the determination of kinetic parameters obtained from sigmoidal steady-state kinetics.
