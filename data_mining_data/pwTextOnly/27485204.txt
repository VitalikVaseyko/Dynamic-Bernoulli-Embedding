Many types of human tumour cells overexpress the dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25A. Cdc25A dephosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase and regulates the cell cycle, but other substrates of Cdc25A and their relevant cellular functions have yet to be identified. We demonstrate here that EGFR activation results in c-Src-mediated Cdc25A phosphorylation at Y59, which interacts with nuclear pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Cdc25A dephosphorylates PKM2 at S37, and promotes PKM2-dependent beta-catenin transactivation and c-Myc-upregulated expression of the glycolytic genes GLUT1, PKM2 and LDHA, and of CDC25A; thus, Cdc25A upregulates itself in a positive feedback loop. Cdc25A-mediated PKM2 dephosphorylation promotes the Warburg effect, cell proliferation and brain tumorigenesis. In addition, we identify positive correlations among Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation, Cdc25A and PKM2 in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of Cdc25A Y59 phosphorylation correlate with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These findings reveal an instrumental function of Cdc25A in controlling cell metabolism, which is essential for EGFR-promoted tumorigenesis.
