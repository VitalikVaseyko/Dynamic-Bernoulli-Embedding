Energy homeostasis is an essential process during oogenesis, nutrients are required for suitable embryonic development, and recently, studies have investigated metabolic activity during this process. This work aims the investigation of dynamics of energy source utilization of Rhynchophorus palmarum during embryogenesis. For this, we first evaluated the mobilization kinetics of the lipids and glycogen. Thereafter, the synthesis of RNA, protein, and the involvement of enzyme of the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. Results showed that lipid content decreased in contrast with the lipase activity. The total glycogen amounts it was partly consumed and the glucose content increased, but then values remained stable until hatching. Total RNA content increased, and no significant changes in total protein content were observed. A study of the glycolytic pathway data showed activity of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase at the beginning of embryogenesis. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate formed is driven into the pentose-phosphate pathway viewed the high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Finally, these results showed that mobilization of different energy sources together with different enzymatic activities has an important role in embryonic development of R. palmarum.
