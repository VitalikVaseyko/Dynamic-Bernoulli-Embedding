A technique is described which allows preparations of hepatocytes, enriched in either periportal or perivenous hepatocytes ('PP-cells' and 'PV-cells' respectively), in a yield of about 30-50% compared with control cell preparations. The liver is first perfused for 40-60s with digitonin (4 mg/ml) to destroy selectively either the periportal or the perivenous part of the microcirculatory unit, and then the remaining hepatocytes are isolated by the ordinary collagenase perfusion technique. In periportal cells the activities of alanine aminotransferase and pyruvate kinase were 29.4 and 18.7 mumol/min per mg of DNA respectively. The rate of gluconeogenesis was 0.402 mumol/min per mg of DNA. In perivenous cells the corresponding values were 9.55, 22.1 and 0.244 mumol/min per mg of DNA respectively. These data support the concept of a zonation of glucose metabolism within the microcirculatory unit of the liver, with the afferent part (periportal zone) having a 2-fold, more active gluconeogenesis than the efferent part (perivenous zone).
