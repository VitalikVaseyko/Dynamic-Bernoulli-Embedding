1. Two duplicate groups of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri; mean weight 27 g) were given diets of differing selenium content (deficient 0.025 mg Se/kg; supplemented 1.022 mg Se/kg) for 30 weeks. 2. There were no significant differences between treatments in weight gain but packed cell volume, liver vitamin E and liver and plasma Se concentrations were all significantly lower in the Se-deficient trout. 3. Ataxia occurred in about 10% of the Se-deficient trout and histopathologies were evident in nerve cord (damage to axon sheath) and liver (loss of integrity in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria with appearance of increased vesiculation). 4. Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) activity was significantly reduced in liver and plasma of Se-deficient fish but there was no indication, from differential assay, of any non-Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity. Glutathione transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) activity was significantly increased in Se-deficient trout.
