Following endotoxin administration to fasted rats, the liver fructose 2,6-bisphosphate level is significantly increased within 1 hr, is elevated 2.3-fold by 3 hrs, and remains elevated 2 to 3-fold for at least 24 hrs. This increase in the potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase occurs when there is no change in the liver Glc 6-P, glycogen or cAMP concentrations, or in the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or pyruvate kinase. The increase in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration accounts for the increased phosphofructokinase activity previously observed in hepatocytes isolated 18 hours following endotoxin administration to rats (1). By stimulating the phosphofructokinase/Fru 1,6-bisphosphate cycle in the direction of glycolysis, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is likely the factor responsible for decreased gluconeogenesis in endotoxemia.
