The bioactivity of the acetate of the all-racemic, 1-thio analog of alpha-tocopherol (all-rac-1-thio-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) has been determined by measuring its ability to decrease plasma levels of pyruvate kinase in vitamin E deficient rats using the curative myopathy bioassay. The thio analog is only 0.22 times as active as RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate and is therefore approximately 0.33 times as active as all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, since the latter has been shown to be 1.47 times less active than RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate in the same bioassay (H. Weiser, M. Vecchi and M. Schlachter, Internat. J. Vit. Nutr. Res., 55, 149-158 (1985)). The 0.33:1.0 ratio is similar to the ratio of 0.41:1.0 measured for the in vitro antioxidant activities of the corresponding free phenols. This finding lends further support to our view that the vitamin E activity in the curative myopathy bioassay of close structural analogs of alpha-tocopherol is determined primarily by the in vitro antioxidant activity of the analog relative to alpha-tocopherol, consistent with the belief that vitamin E functions primarily as a general purpose, lipid-soluble antioxidant in mammals.
