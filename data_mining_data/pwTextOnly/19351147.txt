Alpha,beta-difluoromethylene deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates (dNTPs, N = A or C) are advantageously obtained via phosphorylation of corresponding dNDP analogues using catalytic ATP, PEP, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and pyruvate kinase. DNA pol beta K(d) values for the alpha,beta-CF(2) and unmodified dNTPs, alpha,beta-NH dUTP, and the alpha,beta-CH(2) analogues of dATP and dGTP are discussed in relation to the conformations of alpha,beta-CF(2) dTTP versus alpha,beta-NH dUTP bound into the enzyme active site.
