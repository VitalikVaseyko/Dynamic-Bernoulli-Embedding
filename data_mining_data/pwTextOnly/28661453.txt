Liver X receptors (LXRalpha/beta) and carbohydrate response element-binding proteins (ChREBPalpha/beta) are key players in the transcriptional control of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. LXRalpha/beta double knockout (LXRalpha(-/-)/beta(-/-)) mice have reduced feeding-induced nuclear O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling, ChREBPalpha activity, and lipogenic gene expression in livers, suggesting important roles for LXRs in linking hepatic glucose utilization to lipid synthesis. However, the role of LXRs in fructose-induced ChREBP activation and lipogenesis is currently unknown. In this study, we studied the effects of high fructose or high glucose feeding on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenic gene expression in livers from fasted (24 h) and fasted-refed (12 h) wild type and LXRalpha knockout (LXRalpha(-/-)) mice. Hepatic lipogenic gene expression was reduced in glucose fed, but not fructose fed LXRalpha(-/-) mice. This was associated with lower expression of liver pyruvate-kinase (L-pk) and Chrebpbeta, indicating reduced ChREBPalpha activity in glucose fed, but not fructose fed mice. Interestingly, ChREBP binding to the L-pk promoter was increased in fructose fed LXRalpha(-/-) mice, concomitant with increased glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) expression and O-GlcNAc modified LXRbeta, suggesting a role for LXRbeta in regulating ChREBPalpha activity upon fructose feeding. In conclusion, we propose that LXRalpha is an important regulator of hepatic lipogenesis and ChREBPalpha activity upon glucose, but not fructose feeding in mice.
