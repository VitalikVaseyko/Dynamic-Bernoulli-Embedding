Administration of pyrogenal into rabbits caused a decrease in the activity of phosphorylase A and pyruvate kinase in musculus gastrocnemius as well as pyruvate kinase -- in musculus soleus. The phosphorylase A activity was increased within 3 hrs after the drug administration but it was decreased after the treatment for three days. Administration of hydrocortisone decreased the activity of phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase in both muscles. Activities of total phosphorylase and phosphorylase A were decreased simultaneously with restoration of the pyruvate kinase activity in the both muscles after the complex administration of pyrogenal and hydrocortisone within 3 days. In liver tissue and kidney cortex activities of the enzymes did not differ from those of control animals under all the conditions studied. The various extent and direction in alterations of the same enzymes in dissimilar tissues of a single amnial after administration of pyrogenal and hydrocortisone were considered as the various adaptation of cells of different tissues to the effect of hydrocortisone and as the alteration in tissue reactivity in experimental fever animals to the hormonal effect.
