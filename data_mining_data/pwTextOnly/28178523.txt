Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) systems are essential for mitochondrial health and normal cellular function. Dysfunction of MQC is emerging as a central mechanism for the pathogenesis of various diseases, including Parkinson's disease. The mammalian mitochondrial rhomboid protease, PARL, has been proposed as a regulator of PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy, which is an essential component of MQC. PARL undergoes an N-terminal autocatalytic cleavage (beta cleavage), which is required for efficient mitophagy. We demonstrate that beta cleavage responds to mitochondrial stress, triggered by the depletion of mitochondrial ATP. Furthermore, we show that PDK2, a key regulator in metabolic plasticity, phosphorylates PARL and regulates beta cleavage. Through regulating beta cleavage and the production of a less active enzyme, PACT, PDK2 negatively regulates PINK1/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy. Taken together, we propose that PDK2/PARL senses defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics, integrating mitochondrial metabolism to mitophagy and MQC in human health and disease.
