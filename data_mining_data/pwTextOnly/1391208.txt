The effect of ATP on bovine adrenal cortex pyruvate kinase has been studied. ATP is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, the Ki being 3.2 mM. Based on the efficiency of tryptophan fluorescence quenching, it was concluded that the magnesium complex of ATP is a true enzyme inhibitor. The role of Mg2+ in the inhibition process consists in the formation of a bridge between the enzyme and ATP. The ATP-dependent mechanism of pyruvate kinase inhibition is a potential physiological regulator of the enzyme determining the lower threshold of its sensitivity in vivo.
