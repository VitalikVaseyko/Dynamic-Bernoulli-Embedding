Effect of carnitine and its synthetic analogue 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate (THP) has been studied in rats with experimental infarction of myocardium following occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Morphological and biochemical changes were determined within 24 hrs after occlusion. The infarcted area was diminished from 29.8% down to 18.7% and 10.9%, in rats treated with THP and carnitine, respectively. The both drugs studied affected favourably the activities of malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and of their isoenzymes as well as the aminotransferase activities in blood plasma. Administration of carnitine caused an increase in the content of lactate and pyruvate in blood plasma, while their ratio was decreased. Thus, the modulation of fatty acids metabolism using betaine derivatives caused a cardioprotective effect.
