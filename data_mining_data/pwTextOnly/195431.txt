A method of photometric analysis is described that allows to determine enzyme activities or substrate concentrations of 50 samples simultaneously in a multicuvette. Test volume is in the range of 30-85 micronl, light path between 0.5 and 2.0 mm. The testing principle can be used for colorimetric measurements and for NADH dependent reactions as well. The procedure is particularly suited for kinetic determinations. Variation coefficients for determinations of substrate concentrations and enzyme activities are in the range of conventional enzymatic tests.
