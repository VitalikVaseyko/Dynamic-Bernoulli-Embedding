The specific activities and changes of four placental enzymes: pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconic-dehydrogenase (6PGD), and NADP malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MD) occurring during the course of gestation and during maternal restricted food intake, were studied in rats. Enzymes activities are expressed in relation to DNA. With the progress of pregnancy, a significant increase in the activity of all enzymes, except NADP-MD, was observed in both groups. A 50% food restriction during pregnancy markedly decreased cell placental enzymes in different stages of development. PK was lower during early and late pregnancy, but NADP-MD was reduced only in the early developmental stage. The activities of G6PD and 6PGD were significantly lower only in the near-term stage in the malnourished group in comparison with the control group. Our findings suggest that this kind of nutritional insult markedly reduces glycolytic capacity and NADPH2 generation enzymes, a key factor in the placental steroids metabolism.
