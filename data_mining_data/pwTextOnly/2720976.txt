This is a kinetic assay for measuring K+ in serum, based on the activation of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) by K+. We eliminated interference from Na+ and NH4+ ions, which also activate this enzyme, by including Na+-binding and NH4+-consuming reagents in the reaction mixture. The assay was developed with and evaluated in the Cobas Fara centrifugal analyzer (and has been used in other kinetic analyzers). Within-run and between-run CVs were less than 1.4% and less than 1.6%, respectively. The reaction rate per millimole of K+ per liter (0.05 delta A/min) was more than double that of the reagent blank (0.02 delta A/min). Results correlated well with those by flame photometry, and interference from bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipids, heparin, and other cations was negligible. This method, in conjunction with a previous method we have reported in which beta-galactosidase is used for measuring Na+ in serum, offers a practical alternative to the use of ion-selective electrodes and flame photometry for measuring these clinically important monovalent cations in high-throughput or "stat" biochemical analyzers.
