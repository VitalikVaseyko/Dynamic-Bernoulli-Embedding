A 12-year-old male of Chinese ancestry had life-long hemolytic anemia attributed to alpha-thalassemia. Restriction endonuclease mapping of his DNA revealed that in reality, he had three alpha-globin loci, but he was homozygous for pyruvate kinase deficiency. The new pyruvate kinase variant carried by this patient was characterized and designated PK Fukien.
