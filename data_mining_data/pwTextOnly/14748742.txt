We present a ribozyme-based strategy for studying the effects of Bcl2 down-regulation. The anti-bcl2 hammerhead ribozyme Rz-bcl2 was stably transfected into MCF7 cancer cells and the cleavage of Bcl2 mRNA was demonstrated using a new assay for cleavage product detection, while Western blot analysis showed a concomitant depletion of Bcl2 protein. Rz-bcl2-expressing cells were more sensitive to staurosporine than control cells. Moreover, both molecular and cellular read-outs indicated that staurosporine-induced cell death was necrosis rather than apoptosis in these cells. The study of the effects of Bcl2 down-regulation was extended to the global MCF7 protein expression profile, exploiting a proteomic approach. Two reference electro-pherograms of Rz-bcl2-transfected cells, one with the ribozyme in a catalytically active form and the other with the ribozyme in a catalytically inactive form, were obtained. When comparing the two-dimensional maps, 53 differentially expressed spots were found, four of which were identified by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight) MS as calreticulin, nucleophosmin, phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. How the up-regulation of these proteins might help to explain the modification of Bcl2 activity is discussed.
