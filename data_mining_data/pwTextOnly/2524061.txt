The effect of estradiol and progesterone on the activity of 3 regulatory enzymes of glycolysis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase) in the brain of female rats was studied in the initial phase of hormonal action. Steroids were capable of modifying epileptic activity caused by pentetrazol, the action of estradiol being epileptogenic, that of progesterone anticonvulsant. Hormone action modifying epileptic activity, probably results from changes in intracellular metabolism and from changes in electrogenesis of nerve cells, the second mechanism being predominant.
