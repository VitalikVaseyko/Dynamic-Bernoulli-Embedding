Rat heart mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate (in the presence of 20% as much malate) took up nearly the amount of oxygen required for complete oxidation to CO2. Thus pyruvate, a physiological substrate of the citrate cycle, is oxidized through the entire cycle in these mitochondria, and they seem suitable for study of regulation of integrated mitochondrial energy transduction. By addition of graded amounts of hexokinase or pyruvate kinase to the suspending medium (in the presence of excess glucose or phosphoenolpyruvate), a wide range of steady-state values of the ATP/ADP concentration ratio was obtained. At a constant concentration of phosphate, the steady-state rate of oxygen uptake by rat heart mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate was a function of the adenylate energy charge or of the ATP/ADP ratio, and relatively independent of the absolute concentrations of these nucleotides. The oxygen uptake rates typically spanned a range of about 20-fold. At very high values of the ATP/ADP ratio, the rate of oxygen uptake is much lower than the "state 4" rate seen after added ADP has been phosphorylated. This result suggests that "state 4" respiration, at least in these freshly prepared mitochondria, measures the rate at which ADP is made available by ATPase activity, rather than indicating uncoupling of electron transport from phosphorylation. The concentration of orthophosphate affected the rate of oxygen uptake and the pattern of response to the ATP/ADP ratio or the energy charge, but the effects did not seem interpretable in terms of the mass-action expression for hydrolysis of ATP, (ATP)/ (ADP) (Pi).
