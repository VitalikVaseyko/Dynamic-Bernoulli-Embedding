The specific activities of pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase but not lactate dehydrogenase increase as P-815 mastocytoma cells approach the stationary phase. During this growth period, the rates of uptake of labelled precursors into DNA, RNA and total protein decreases. On the other hand, the pyruvate kinase protein level changes in parallel with activity. Although the K-isozyme is the primary form of pyruvate kinase expressed, some M-type subunit is also present and both forms undergo an increase in specific activity. In addition, pyruvate kinase expression is also elevated by adding cAMP analogues with theophylline, butyrate or conditioned media. This increased level of expression is hypothesized to be a secondary event associated with a differentiation-like-induced expression of the mast cell phenotype.
