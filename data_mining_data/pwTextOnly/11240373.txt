Metabolic alterations that accompany parasitism of invertebrate animals can play an important role in parasite development. Employing 13C NMR, this study examined pyruvate cycling from (2-(13)C)pyruvate in the lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta, and the effects of parasitism by the hymenopteran Cotesia congregata on the gluconeogenic formation of trehalose, the haemolymph or blood sugar of insects. Larvae were maintained on a semi-synthetic sucrose-free diet, or on the same diet with sucrose at 8.5 g/l. Pyruvate cycling was evident from the 13C enrichment in C3 of alanine, derived following carboxylation to oxaloacetate, and was similar in parasitized and normal insects regardless of diet. Trehalose was formed following de novo synthesis of glucose, and net synthesis was estimated from the 13C distribution in trehalose and alanine. The 13C-enrichment ratio [2trehalose C6/alanine C3] is an indicator of the level of gluconeogenesis relative to glycolysis, both enrichments were derived from (2-(13)C)pyruvate in the same manner. The ratio was greater than unity in all insects, regardless of diet, but was significantly greater in parasitized larvae, demonstrating an enhanced level of gluconeogenesis. This was confirmed by analysis of the 13C distribution in trehalose and glutamine derived from (3-(13)C)alanine. Despite enhanced de novo trehalose formation in parasitized insects, the haemolymph sugar level was similar to that of normal larvae. Because haemolymph trehalose regulates dietary carbohydrate intake, but not gluconeogenesis, the results suggest that accelerated induction of gluconeogenesis is an adaptive response to parasitism that provides increased carbohydrate for parasite growth and simultaneously maintains nutrient intake.
