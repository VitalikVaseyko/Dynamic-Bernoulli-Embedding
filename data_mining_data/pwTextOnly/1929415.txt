Ingestion of an ammonium containing diet produces hyperammonemia and protects rats against acute ammonium intoxication. Acute ammonium toxicity has been attributed to the depletion of energy metabolite intermediates. We show here that hyperammonemia affords considerable protection against depletion of hepatic energy metabolites evoked by ammonium acetate injection. In control rats there were marked decreases in the content of acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, ATP, 2-oxoglutarate, lactate, and pyruvate while phosphoenolpyruvate increased markedly. In hyperammonemic rats beta-hydroxybutyrate, ATP, 2-oxoglutarate, and lactate were not significantly affected while pyruvate increased markedly and phosphoenolpyruvate slightly. These results suggest that in controls the activity of pyruvate kinase is inhibited after ammonium injection while in hyperammonemic rats it is not inhibited. The content of alanine (an inhibitor of pyruvate kinase) reached 2.8 mumol/g in controls and 1.6 mumol/g in hyperammonemic rats, 15 min after ammonium injection. This could explain the different effects of ammonium injection on control and hyperammonemic rats.
