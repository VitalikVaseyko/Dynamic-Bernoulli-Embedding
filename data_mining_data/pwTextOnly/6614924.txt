Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from Mycobacterium smegmatis has been purified to homogeneity through a seven-step procedure with a yield of 16% and specific activity of 220 units/mg protein. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 230,700 and was composed of four subunits with identical molecular weights of 57,540. Analysis of amino acid composition revealed a low content of aromatic amino acids. The enzyme exhibited sigmoidal kinetics of varying concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, the degree of cooperativity and S0.5v value for phosphoenolpyruvate being strongly dependent on the pH of the reaction mixture. Among the nucleoside diphosphates acting as substrate for pyruvate kinase, ADP was the best phosphate acceptor, as judged by its lowest Km value. The enzyme showed an absolute requirement for divalent cations (either Mg2+ or Mn2+), but monovalent cations were not necessary for activity. Other divalent cations inhibited the Mg2+-activated enzyme to varying degrees (Ni2+ greater than Zn2+ greater than Cu2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Ba2+). The differences in the kinetic responses of the enzyme to Mg2+ and Mn2+ are discussed.
