The aim of the work was to evaluate whether or not there is glycolytic reprogramming in the neighboring cells of colorectal cancer (CRC). Using postoperative material we have compared the functional capacity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in CRC cells, their glycolytic activity and their inclination to aerobic glycolysis, with those of the surrounding and healthy colon tissue cells. Experiments showed that human CRC cannot be considered a hypoxic tumor, since the malignancy itself and cells surrounding it exhibited even higher rates of OXPHOS than healthy large intestine. The absence of acute hypoxia in colorectal carcinomas was also confirmed by their practically equal glucose-phosphorylating capacity as compared with surrounding non-tumorous tissue and by upregulation of VEGF family and their ligands. Studies indicated that human CRC cells in vivo exert a strong distant effect on the energy metabolism of neighboring cells, so that they acquire the bioenergetic parameters specific to the tumor itself. The growth of colorectal carcinomas was associated with potent downregulation of the creatine kinase system. As compared with healthy colon tissue, the tumor surrounding cells display upregulation of OXPHOS and have high values of basal and ADP activated respiration rates. Strong differences between the normal and CRC cells in the affinity of their mitochondria for ADP were revealed; the corresponding Km values were measured as 93.6+/-7.7 microM for CRC cells and 84.9+/-9.9 microM for nearby tissue; both these apparent Km (ADP) values were considerably (by almost 3 times) lower in comparison with healthy colon tissue cells (256+/-34 microM).
