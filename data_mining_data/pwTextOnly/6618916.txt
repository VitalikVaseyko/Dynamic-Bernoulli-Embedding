Using lyophilized cryostat sections of liver the activities of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase were measured using a Lowry technique in the first layer of hepatocytes adjacent to terminal hepatic venules and in the residual parenchymal of the perivenous zone of the acinus in normally fed adult male Wistar rats. Alanine aminotransferase was homogeneously distributed in the two areas measured (ratio hepatocytes adjacent to terminal hepatic venules/residual parenchyma of the perivenous zone: 1.05). Enzyme activities of the lactate dehydrogenase were significantly lower in the hepatocytes adjacent to terminal hepatic venules (ratio: 0.65) and those of the pyruvate kinase significantly higher (ratio: 1.12) than in the residual parenchyma of the perivenous zone indicating liver cell heterogeneity in this zone of the liver acinus.
