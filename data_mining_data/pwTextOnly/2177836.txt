In contrast to the species with erythrocytes of high 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate content, in the sheep the concentration of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate decreases during maturation of reticulocytes. The decrease can be explained by the drop of the phosphofructokinase/pyruvate kinase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase/2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase activity ratios that result from the decline of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase and the bifunctional enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase. The concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and aldohexose 1,6-bisphosphates also decrease during sheep reticulocyte maturation in parallel to the 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase and the glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase activities.
