3-Arsonopyruvate was prepared in four steps from glycine. The arsenic-carbon bond was formed by a Meyer reaction between alkaline arsenite and 2-bromo-3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid; the 3-arsono-2-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid formed was oxidized with periodate to give 3-arsonopyruvate. This proves to be an alternative substrate for phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, giving pyruvate, which was assayed using lactate dehydrogenase. The K(m) is 20 microM, similar to that observed for the natural substrate phosphonopyruvate (17 microM), whereas the kcat. of 0.01 s-1 was much lower than that for phosphonopyruvate (58 s-1). Arsonopyruvate competitively inhibited the action of the mutase on phosphonopyruvate.
