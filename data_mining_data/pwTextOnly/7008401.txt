Imidazole derivatives with antifungal activity were investigated in their effects on concentrated and diluted suspensions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus. Against Candida albicans, activity of the imidazol derivatives was higher in diluted suspensions than in concentrated suspensions: this fact proves the presence of a microbe-count sensitivity. Against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus, no microbe-count sensitivity of clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, ketoconazole, or N-148/76 could be detected by Warburg assay on resting microbes.
