A 15-month-old male Beagle with chronic hemolytic anemia was found to have erythrocytic pyruvate kinase deficiency and, terminally, myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis. The dog's erythron was studied by procedures that enabled close comparison with congenital hemolytic anemia (pyruvate kinase deficiency) of Basenji dogs. The affected dog's sire, dam, and one littermate--each clinically and hematologically normal--were found to have 50% reduction in erythrocytic pyruvate kinase (PK) activity.
