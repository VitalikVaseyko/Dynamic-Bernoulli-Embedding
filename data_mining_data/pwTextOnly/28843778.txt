Mitophagy, a special type of autophagy, plays an important role in the mitochondria quality control and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of mitophagy induction with benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which acts as a prosurvival response against apoptotic cell death. Our study showed that B[a]P displayed higher cytotoxicity in autophagy-deficient HaCaT cells as compared to control. Further, we showed that B[a]P triggered the Beclin-1-dependent autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Moreover, our study indicated that the B[a]P-induced autophagy was initiated through the activation of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in HaCaT cells. Intriguingly, the B[a]P-induced Beclin-1-mediated mitophagy was suppressed in CYP1B1 and AhR knockdown HaCaT cells, indicating a crucial role of B[a]P activation in the mitophagy induction to regulate cell death. B[a]P was shown to increase the mitochondrial dysfunction and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in depletion of ATP level along with the inhibition of the oxygen consumption rate in HaCaT cells. Importantly, the supplementation of methyl pyruvate compensated for the B[a]P-induced drop in the ATP level and mitigated the reactive oxygen species burden and autophagy. Mechanistically, B[a]P inhibited the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and we found that the activated mitochondrial CYP1B1 interacted with MnSOD, inflicting mitophagy to protect from B[a]P-induced apoptosis. In summary, our study reveals mitophagy induction as a cellular protection mechanism against B[a]P-triggered toxicity and carcinogenesis.
