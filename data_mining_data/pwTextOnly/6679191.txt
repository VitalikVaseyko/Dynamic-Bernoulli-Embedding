A single immobilized enzyme nylon tube reactor was produced incorporating a four enzyme system for the analysis of creatinine. The enzyme activity ratios in the coupling solution used to prepare the reactor were found to be of extreme importance in governing the activity of the latter. The reactor was incorporated into a continuous flow analysis system used to assay creatinine in urine samples and the results were correlated with a manual technique employing the same enzyme system in solution. The precision, correlation, high specificity, simplicity, and speed of the analysis were concluded to be factors in favor of the method's suitability for urine creatinine determinations.
