Early juveniles of the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus were exposed for 60 days to 10 and 40 mg/L of pure glyphosate (acid form) in freshwater. Mortality was 33 % at the highest concentration, while no differences in molting were noted among treatments. After the first month of exposure, weight gain was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the 40 mg/L group. At the end of the assay, lipid levels in muscle, as well as protein level in both hepatopancreas and muscle were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced. These results suggest long-term utilization of both lipid and protein as main energetic reserves, likely in response to the chronic stress associated with herbicide exposure. Besides, the lower pyruvate kinase activity in muscle suggests a possible metabolic depression in this tissue. The hemolymphatic ASAT:ALAT ratio showed higher levels than the control at the highest glyphosate concentration, indicating possible damage to several tissues.
