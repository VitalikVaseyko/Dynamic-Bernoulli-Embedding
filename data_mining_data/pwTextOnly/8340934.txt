The effectiveness of a newly developed crystalloid cardioplegic solution containing 4 mM 1-hexanol and 10 mM pyruvate was compared with St Thomas' Hospital solution. After control perfusion with a Langendorff method, rabbit hearts (n = 7 for each group) were arrested and stored in these solutions (4 degrees C) for 24 h and subsequently reperfused for 45 min. The hexanol solution preserved both left ventricular systolic and diastolic function significantly better than St Thomas' Hospital solution. Developed pressure was significantly higher after preservation with the hexanol solution than with the St Thomas' Hospital solution at left ventricular balloon volumes larger than the mid volume (P < 0.05). The maximum developed pressure values after storage with the hexanol and St Thomas' Hospital solution were 77% and 42% of the maximum control values, respectively. Values for end-diastolic pressure at the maximum ventricular volume were 26.1 +/- 9.8 and 66.7 +/- 24.6 mmHg for the hexanol and St Thomas' Hospital solution, respectively (P < 0.05). Creatine kinase release during the first 15 min of reperfusion was significantly lower with the hexanol solution as compared to St Thomas's Hospital solution (28.3 +/- 8.3 vs 92.9 +/- 52.6 IU/g wet weight, P < 0.05). In conclusion, a hexanol cardioplegic solution may be suitable for long-term cardiac preservation. Further evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of this solution is warranted.
