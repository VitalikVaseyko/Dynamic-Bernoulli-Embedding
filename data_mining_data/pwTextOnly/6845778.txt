The simplest methods for the diagnosis of thalassaemias are the morphology of erythrocytes, the Hb-F-elution test and the Hb H Heinz bodies test. In order to prove the sickle cell anomaly sickle cell preparation and Hb-S-precipitation test can be performed in every laboratory. By means of the isopropanol precipitation test or the Heinz bodies test can be searched for instable haemoglobins without any laboratory expenditure. On the other hand, haemoglobins with increased oxygen affinity demand a measurement of the oxygen affinity of the erythrocytes. However, simple fluorescence or dye-stuff methods are out our disposal for the most important erythrocytic enzymopenias.
