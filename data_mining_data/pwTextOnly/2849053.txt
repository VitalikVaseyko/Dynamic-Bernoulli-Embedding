The influence of starvation on renal carbohydrate metabolism was studied in the proximal and distal fragments of the nephron. Starvation induced a double and opposite adaptation mechanism in both fractions of the renal tubule. In renal proximal tubules, the gluconeogenic flux was stimulated progressively during a period of 48 hours of starvation (2.15 fold), due, in part, to a significant increase in the fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities although with different characteristics. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity from this tubular fragment increased only at subsaturating subtrate concentration (68%) which involved a significant decrease in the Km (35%) for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate while there was no change in Vmax. This behaviour clearly indicates that it is related to modifications in the activity of the preexistent enzyme in the cell. Proximal phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity increased proportionally at both substrate concentrations (86 and 89% respectively) which brought about changes in Vmax without changes in Km, all of which are in accordance with variations in the cellular levels of the enzyme. In the renal distal tubules, the glycolytic capacity drastically decreased throughout the starvation time. At 48 hours 65% of inhibition was shown. We have found a short term regulation of phosphofructokinase activity by starvation which involves an increase in Km (2.2 fold) without changes in Vmax, as a result of these kinetic changes, an inactivation of phosphofructokinase was detected at subsaturating concentration of fructose 6-phosphate. On the contrary, this nutritional state did not modify the kinetic behaviour of renal pyruvate kinase. Finally, neither proximal glycolytic nor distal gluconeogenic capacities and related enzymes activities were changed during starvation.
