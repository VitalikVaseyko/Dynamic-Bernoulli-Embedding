This report describes a one-pot synthesis of alpha-P-borano-, alpha-P-thio-, and alpha-P-seleno-modified nucleoside diphosphate analogues that are otherwise difficult to obtain. The key step involves the intramolecular nucleophilic attack by an amino group in 5 to remove the gamma-phosphate. The absolute configurations of P-diastereomers were confirmed by analysis of their 1H NMR. Affinity studies revealed that the nucleoside boranodiphosphates are potentially useful in antiviral research.
