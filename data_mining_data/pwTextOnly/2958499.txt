Single muscle fibres separated from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) as well as soleus (SOL) in the Wistar strain male rat in relaxing solution were typed histochemically, then glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities were determined on the same fibres. Glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and creatine kinase (CK) showed highest activities in fast-twitch glycolytic (FG), lower in fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG) and lowest in slow-twitch oxidative (SO) fibres. Also oxidative enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) showed highest activities in SO, lower in FOG and lowest in FG fibres. The activities of LDH, PFK, PK and CK in FOG fibres separated from EDL showed higher activity compared to those separated from SOL, whereas the opposite result was obtained for the activities of SDH and MDH. Enzyme activities in a single muscle fibre type were not distinguishable from those of another type, and the activity profiles overlapped over a considerable range. The correlations among the separate enzyme activities of CK, LDH and MDH obtained from the same single fibre overlapped over a considerable range.
