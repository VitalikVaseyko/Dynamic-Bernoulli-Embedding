When batch and continuous Bacillus subtilis cultures are provided with a small amount of citrate, acid production ceases, carbon yield increases by more than 2-fold, and the productivity of recombinant protein increases. It has been hypothesized that pyruvate kinase activity is attenuated, which in turn lowers glucose flux and minimizes the acid overflow prompted by low Krebs cycle capacity. To complement existing enzyme activity, linear programming, and metabolite pool studies, (13)C NMR studies were performed. Atom mapping and isotopomer mapping matrix methods were used to select the best glucose label. "Best" was defined such that the NMR spectra of glutamate associated with metabolizing labeled glucose via the different candidate metabolic trafficking scenarios would differ considerably in fine structure (e.g., relative singlet intensities). When experiments were performed with 1-(13)C glucose, the observed NMR spectra corresponded well to the one predicted to arise when the metabolic trafficking occurs according to a pyruvate kinase attenuation scenario. This evidence further fortifies the prospects for successfully basing a metabolic engineering strategy on reducing pyruvate kinase activity to better match glycolytic and Krebs cycle capacities.
