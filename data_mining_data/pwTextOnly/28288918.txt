We hypothesized that elevations of carbon dioxide (CO2) commonly found in modern buildings will stimulate leukocytes to produce microparticles (MPs) and activate the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome due to mitochondrial oxidative stress. Human and murine neutrophils generate MPs with high interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) content when incubated ex vivo in buffer equilibrated with 0.1-0.4% additional CO2. Enhanced MPs production requires mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, which is mediated by activities of pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Subsequent events leading to MPs generation include perturbation of inositol 1,3,5-triphosphate receptors, a transient elevation of intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C and NADPH oxidase (Nox). Concomitant activation of type-2 nitric oxide synthase yields secondary oxidants resulting in actin S-nitrosylation and enhanced filamentous actin turnover. Numerous proteins are linked to short filamentous actin including vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, focal adhesion kinase, the membrane phospholipid translocation enzymes flippase and floppase, and the critical inflammasome protein ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck protein with CARD domain). Elevations of CO2 cause oligomerization of the inflammasome components ASC, NLRP3, caspase 1, thioredoxin interacting protein, and calreticulin - a protein from endoplasmic reticulum, leading to IL-1beta synthesis. An increased production rate of MPs containing elevated amounts of IL-1beta persists for hours after short-term exposures to elevated CO2.
