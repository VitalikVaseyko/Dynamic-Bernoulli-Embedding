1. The activity of pyruvate kinase, malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carbonoxykinase and pyruvate carboxylase was measured in muscle tissue. 2. The enzyme assays were critically evaluated. 3. Muscle tissue possesses at the most only residual activities of pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase. 4. The pyruvate kinase activity was significantly lowered after a 24 hr fast. 5. Malic enzyme activity was increased after the fast.
