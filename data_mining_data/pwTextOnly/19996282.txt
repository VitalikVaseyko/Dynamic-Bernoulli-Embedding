Dendritic cell (DC) function is negatively affected by tumors and tumor-derived factors, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we show that intracellular SOCS3 in DCs binds to pyruvate kinase type M2 (M2-PK), which plays a critical role in ATP production through glycolysis. The interaction of SOCS3 with M2-PK reduced ATP production and impaired DC-based immunotherapy against tumors. Thus, SOCS3, which has been shown to be upregulated by tumor-derived factors, interacts with M2-PK to decrease ATP production, causing DC dysfunction. These dysfunctional DCs have a reduced ability to present antigens. Alteration of DC metabolism mediated by SOCS3 represents a novel mechanism for DC dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment.
