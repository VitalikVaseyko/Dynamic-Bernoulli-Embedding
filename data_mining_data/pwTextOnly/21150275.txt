CC3/TIP30 is a metastasis and tumor suppressor, with reduced or absent expression in a variety of aggressive tumors. Overexpression of CC3 in tumor cells predisposes them to apoptosis in response to different death signals. We found that silencing of CC3 expression does not increase apoptotic resistance of cells. However, it strongly improves survival of tumor cells in response to glucose limitation. HeLa cells with silenced CC3 survive long-term in low glucose, and, in comparison to control HeLa cells, show superior metabolic adaptation to glucose limitation. First, unlike the parental HeLa cells, HeLa with silenced CC3 activate and maintain high levels of mitochondrial respiration that is critical for their ability to thrive in low glucose. Second, silencing of CC3 leads to higher expression levels of mitochondrial proteins in respiration complexes when cells are continuously cultured in limiting glucose. Third, HeLa cells with silenced CC3 maintain higher levels of c-MYC and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase in low glucose, contributing to more efficient glycolysis. Fourth, HeLa cells with silenced CC3 fail to fully activate AMPK in response to glucose limitation. Inhibition of AMPK, either pharmacologic or via siRNA, protects control HeLa cells from death in low glucose. The metabolic flexibility acquired by cells after silencing of CC3 could be directly relevant to the development of metastatic and aggressive human tumors that frequently have low or absent expression of CC3.
