MiR-375 is an important small non-coding RNA that is specifically expressed in islet cells of the pancreas. miR-375 is required for normal pancreatic genesis and influences not only beta-cell mass but also alpha-cell mass. miR-375 is also important to glucose-regulated insulin secretion through the regulation of the expression of Mtpn and Pdk1 genes. When human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiate into endodermal lineages, miR-375 is highly expressed in the definitive endoderm, which suggests that miR-375 may have a distinct role in early development. miR-375 plays an important role in the complex regulatory network of pancreatic development, which could be regulated by pancreatic genes, such as NeuroD1, Ngn3, Pdx1 and Hnf6; additionally, miR-375 regulates genes related to pancreas development, cell growth and proliferation and insulin secretion genes to exert its function. Because of the special role of miR-375, it may be a potential target to treat diabetes. Antagonising miR-375 may enhance the effects of exendin-4 in patients, and controlling the expression of miR-375 could assist mature hESCs-derived beta-cells.
