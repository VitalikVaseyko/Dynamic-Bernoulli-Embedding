A single procedure for the preparation of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from pig heart is described. The five enzymes are obtained in preparative amounts in homogenous form with specific activities equal to or higher than those previously reported. Some molecular properties of pig heart pyruvate kinase are determined.
