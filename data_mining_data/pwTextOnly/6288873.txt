A fraction of chromaffin granule membranes contained a number of substrates for endogenous protein kinase activity as well as endogenous phosphatase activity. The major 32P-labelled polypeptide of molecular weight 43,000 appeared to be the alpha-subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase of residual mitochondria. Several polypeptides showed cyclic AMP stimulation of phosphorylation of which the major polypeptide of molecular weight 59,000 shows half-maximal phosphorylation with 0.49 microM cyclic AMP. The phosphorylation of several other polypeptides is inhibited at high cyclic AMP concentrations. From studies with immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional electrophoresis it was found that alpha- and beta-tubulin and actin were absent from the granule membranes. However 32P labelling of a proportion of the copies of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase was demonstrated. The majority of the substrates for endogenous protein kinase activity are probably on the cytoplasmic side of the granule membrane.
