The glycolytic enzyme enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is active as dimers formed from three subunits encoded by different genes. The embryonic alphaalpha isoform remains distributed in many adult cell types, whereas a transition towards betabeta and gammagamma isoforms occurs in striated muscle cells and neurons respectively. It is not understood why enolase exhibits tissue-specific isoforms with very close functional properties. We approached this problem by the purification of native betabeta-enolase from mouse hindlimb muscles and by raising specific antibodies of high titre against this protein. These reagents have been useful in revealing a heterogeneity of the beta-enolase subunit that changes with in vivo and in vitro maturation. A basic carboxypeptidase appears to be involved in generating an acidic beta-enolase variant, and may regulate plasminogen binding by this subunit. We show for the first time that pure betabeta-enolase binds with high affinity the adjacent enzymes in the glycolytic pathway (pyruvate kinase and phosphoglycerate mutase), favouring the hypothesis that these three enzymes form a functional glycolytic segment. betabeta-Enolase binds with high affinity sarcomeric troponin but not actin and tropomyosin. Some of these binding properties are shared by the alphaalpha-isoenolase, which is also expressed in striated muscle, but not by the neuron-specific gammagamma-enolase. These results support the idea that specific interactions with macromolecules will address muscle enolase isoforms at the subcellular site where ATP, produced through glycolysis, is most needed for contraction. Such a specific targeting could be modulated by post-translational modifications.
