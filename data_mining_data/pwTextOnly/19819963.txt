Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic compound that activates nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Resveratrol has recently been shown to exert potent antidiabetic actions when orally delivered to animal models of type 2 diabetes. However, the tissue(s) mediating these beneficial effects is unknown. Because SIRT1 is expressed in central nervous system (CNS) neurons known to control glucose and insulin homeostasis, we hypothesized that resveratrol antidiabetic effects are mediated by the brain. Here, we report that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of resveratrol normalizes hyperglycemia and greatly improves hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced obese and diabetic mice. It is noteworthy that these effects are independent of changes in body weight, food intake, and circulating leptin levels. In addition, CNS resveratrol delivery improves hypothalamic nuclear factor-kappaB inflammatory signaling by reducing acetylated-RelA/p65 and total RelA/p65 protein contents, and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB alpha and IkappaB kinase beta mRNA levels. Furthermore, this treatment leads to reduced hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 mRNA and protein levels and ameliorates pyruvate-induced hyperglycemia in this mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Collectively, our results unveiled a previously unrecognized key role for the CNS in mediating the antidiabetic actions of resveratrol.
