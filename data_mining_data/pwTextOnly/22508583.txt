Oxidative stress in diabetic tissues is accompanied by high-level of free radicals with simultaneously declined antioxidant enzymes status leading to cell membrane damage. The present study was carried out to observe the effect of sodium orthovanadate (SOV) and Trigonella foenum graecum seed powder (TSP) administration on blood glucose and insulin levels, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and protein kinase C in heart, muscle and brain of the alloxan-induced diabetic rats to see whether the treatment with SOV and TSP was capable of reversing the diabetic effects. Diabetes was induced by administration of alloxan monohydrate (15 mg/100 g body weight), and rats were treated with 2 IU insulin, 0.6 mg/ml SOV, 5% TSP in the diet and a combination of 0.2 mg/ml SOV and 5% TSP separately for 21 days. Blood glucose levels increased markedly in diabetic rats, animals treated with a combined dose of SOV and TSP had glucose levels almost comparable with controls, similar results were obtained in the activities of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, antioxidant enzymes and protein kinase C in diabetic animals. Our results showed that lower doses of SOV (0.2 mg/ml) could be used in combination with TSP to effectively reverse diabetic alterations in experimental diabetes.
