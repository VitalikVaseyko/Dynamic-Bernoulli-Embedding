The increased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase induced in hearts of rats by starvation for 48 h was maintained following preparation of cardiac myocytes, and it was also maintained, though at a decreased level, after 25 h of culture in medium 199. This loss of PDH kinase activity was not prevented by n-octanoate, dibutyryl cyclic AMP or glucagon. The PDH kinase activity of myocytes from fed rats was increased to that of starved rats after 25 h of culture with n-octanoate, dibutyryl cyclic AMP or both agents together.
