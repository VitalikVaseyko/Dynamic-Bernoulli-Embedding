This study points to the analysis of the morphological features suggestive of somatic mutations, mostly the BRAFV600E mutation, on cytological samples of thyroid carcinomas. According to the literature, the application of ancillary techniques on cytology comes in handy as a challenging aid in ruling out a malignant outcome on both conventional and liquid-based cytological preparations. However, the evaluation of somatic mutations, including BRAFV600E, usually performed by DNA techniques, may have some limitations in a worldwide diffusion. In this perspective, few authors emphasized the morphological search for BRAFV600E mutations harbored in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and characterized by specific architectural and cellular findings (i.e. eosinophilic cells defined as 'plump cells' and sickle-shaped nuclei). Hence, the detection of eosinophilic cytoplasm of mutated PTC cells seems to suggest the possible involvement of the 'Warburg effect' pioneering the ability of cancer cells to convert glucose into lactic acid. The recent yields of immunohistochemical expression of monocarboxylate transporters in mutated PTCs may suggest the accumulation of lactate in these plump cells. Equally importantly, the detection of these morphological findings using fine-needle aspiration cytology may be helpful in triaging thyroid lesions and limiting costs. Additionally, it may lead to the stratification of the malignant risk and personalized management in cases with multifocal lesions.
