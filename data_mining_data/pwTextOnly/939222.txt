In extracts of human tissues only three different pyruvate kinases were demonstrated by acetate gel electrophoresis. Treatment with reduced glutathione resulted in an alteration of electrophoretic mobility of extracts from kidney and testis. The existence of interconvertible forms of M2 pyruvate kinase (PK) was suggested. Lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, platelets were M2 type PK. An electrophoretic slow form was demonstrated in myeloblasts and lymphoblasts.
