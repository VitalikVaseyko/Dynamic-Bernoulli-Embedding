The fermentation pattern of Lactococcus lactis with altered activities of the las enzymes was examined on maltose. The wild type converted 65% of the maltose to mixed acids. An increase in phosphofructokinase or lactate dehydrogenase expression shifted the fermentation towards homolactic fermentation, and with a high level of expression of the las operon the fermentation was homolactic.
