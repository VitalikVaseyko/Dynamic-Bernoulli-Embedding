Protection against thermal denaturation, urea denaturation and tryptic inactivation of rat liver glucokinase (ATP:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2979192) is provided by glucose and to a lesser degree sorbitol. 2. Protection by glucose exhibits two distinct stages, one occurring at the physiological substrate levels, while the other occurring well above that necessary for enzyme saturation. Sorbitol protection increases uniformly with increasing sorbitol concentration. 3. Several other enzymes also are protected against heat inactivation by high concentrations of glucose or sorbitol.
