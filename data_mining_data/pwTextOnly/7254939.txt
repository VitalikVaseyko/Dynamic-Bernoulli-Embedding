Red cell glycolytic intermediates and enzymes in term infants in the first year of life were correlated with the fetal hemoglobin concentration (%F), intra- and extracellular venous pH, plasma inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Changes in the non-age-dependent enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and phosphofructokinase correlated most significantly with the postnatal decline in %F (P less than 0.001), not the age of the red cell population, as reflected in PK activity. The age-dependent enzymes, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, however, correlated well with PK activity (P less than 0.001). The concentration of glucose-6-phosphate did not correlate significantly with the postnatal decline in %F (P greater than 0.05) or PK (P greater than 0.10), but correalted significantly with the plasma Pi concentration (P less than 0.001). "Total triose phosphate" and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate did not correlate with Pi. It appears from these studies that an extracellular factor, Pi alters the pattern of glycolytic intermediates in term infants and that the postnatal changes in phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and phosphofructokinase are unique to the "fetal" red cell and reflect passage from fetal to "adult" erythropoiesis.
