The Vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a proton pump responsible for controlling the intracellular and extracellular pH of cells. The structure of V-ATPase has been highly conserved among all eukaryotic cells and is involved in diverse functions across species. V-ATPase is best known for its acidification of endosomes and lysosomes and is also important for luminal acidification of specialized cells. Several reports have suggested the involvement of V-ATPase in maintaining an alkaline intracellular and acidic extracellular pH thereby aiding in proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells respectively. Increased expression of V-ATPase and relocation to the plasma membrane aids in cancer modulates key tumorigenic cell processes like autophagy, Warburg effect, immunomoduation, drug resistance and most importantly cancer cell signaling. In this review, we discuss the direct role of V-ATPase in acidification and indirect regulation of signaling pathways, particularly Notch Signaling.
