Reprogrammed glucose metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer cells, which show a unique metabolic phenotype known as the Warburg effect. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key enzyme in the glycolytic process, executes the final step by conversion of lactate into pyruvate. However, little is known about the roles of LDHA in human glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of LDHA and elucidate related underlying mechanisms. Data derived from Oncomine database showed that LDHA is commonly upregulated in GBM tissues in comparison with corresponding normal controls. Silencing of LDHA expression resulted in reduced glycolysis, decreased cell growth, increased cell apoptosis, and attenuated invasive ability. In the presence of 2-deoxyglucose, a glycolysis inhibitor, the oncogenic activities of LDHA were completely blocked. These findings provide evidence of the cellular functions of LDHA in the progression of GBM and suggest that LDHA might act as a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment.
