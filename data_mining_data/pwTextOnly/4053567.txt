Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), malic enzyme (ME), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate kinase (PK), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of gill tissue from Modiolus demissus (ribbed mussel), Mytilus edulis (sea mussel), Crassostrea virginica (oyster) and Mercenaria mercenaria (quahog) were determined using enzyme assay and starch gel electrophoresis combined with subcellular fractionation. AAT showed distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes in gills of all these animals. Although ALAT showed distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes in the gills of oysters, sea mussels and quahogs, only the mitochondrial ALAT was evident in ribbed mussel gill tissue. PK and PEPCK were cytosolic in all these preparations. ME was found only in the mitochondrial fraction of ribbed mussel and quahog gill tissue whereas sea mussel gills showed distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial ME isozymes. With oyster gills, the "cytosolic ME" was electrophoretically identical to the mitochondrial ME indicating that in vivo, the ME is probably mitochondrial. MDH showed distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes in all bivalve gills tested.
