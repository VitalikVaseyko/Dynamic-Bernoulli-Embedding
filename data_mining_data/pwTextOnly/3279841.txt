Charles River male Wistar rats (200-300 g) were meal fed for 9-10 days, injected with either saline, epidermal growth factor (EGF), ethanol, or ethanol combined with EGF and their livers were freeze clamped 5 min after intraperitoneal injection of EGF. Metabolites were measured and the redox state and phosphorylation potential were calculated. Epidermal growth factor alone elevated hepatic content of glucose 1-P, glucose 6-P, fructose 6-P, and 3-phosphoglycerate 1.2-1.3-fold when compared to saline treatment. Ethanol alone decreased hepatic content of 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate 3.2-3.7-fold below saline-treated levels. Ethanol, in combination with EGF, decreased hepatic values for 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate 2.0-2.3-fold from saline treatment but elevated the content of phosphoenolpyruvate 1.6-fold over ethanol treatment alone. Epidermal growth factor inhibited pyruvate kinase activity 1.3-fold when compared to saline controls but ethanol in the presence of EGF facilitated the recovery of activity of this enzyme.
