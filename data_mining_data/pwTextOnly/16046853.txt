To ascertain the regulation of glycolysis during perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, 7-day postnatal rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia with 8% oxygen for up to 90 min. Brain concentrations of glucose, lactate, and key glycolytic intermediates were determined at specific intervals of hypoxia. During hypoxia-ischemia, anaerobic glycolysis increased to approximately 62% of its maximal capacity, which equates to a 135% stimulation of the glycolytic flux. The key regulatory enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, were all stimulated during hypoxia-ischemia, and there were no enzymatic rate limitations. The major rate-limiting step for glycolysis was the transport of glucose across the blood-brain barrier into the brain.
