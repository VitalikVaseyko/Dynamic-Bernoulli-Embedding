Hepatocyte-hepatoma hybrid cells were obtained by fusion of hepatocytes from adult rats and Fao hepatoma cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol. These hybrids were called hepatocytoma cells. The preservation of liver-specific enzyme activities and metabolic functions was studied in the hybrid clone 1E3. 1) The proliferating hepatocytoma cells formed monolayers presenting morphological similarity to primary cultures of hepatocytes. 2) In contrast to Fao hepatoma cells, activities of all gluconeogenic key enzymes were preserved at normal or reduced levels. 3) Lactate-dependent glucose formation was maintained at a state reduced to 36% of the gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes; no glucose formation was detected in Fao hepatoma cells. 4) The activity of the liver-specific glucokinase was reduced in hepatocytoma cells, but it was still present in contrast to Fao cells. The liver-specific isoenzyme pyruvate kinase type L was replaced by the isoenzyme type M2. 5) Gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzyme activities were regulated in hepatocytoma cells by glucagon (0.1 microM) and by insulin (0.1 microM). 6) The genome of hepatocytoma cells and its expression were stable for at least one year, when spontaneously dedifferentiating cells were removed by recloning in hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine (HAT) medium.
