Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) has been utilized as an analytical method to perform investigations on limited proteolysis of proteins. To this purpose partial proteolysis experiments with a series of proteinases were performed, utilizing as model protein pyruvate kinase (PK) from Escherichia coli, an enzyme that is regulated allosterically by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Data obtained with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and MEKC were compared; the profiles generated by submitting digests of PK treated with different proteinases in the presence and absence of FBP to electrophoretic analysis provided a useful adjunct for a better understanding of the effects of the allosteric activator on the conformation of the model enzyme. MEKC was also found to be a convenient technique for determining the kinetics of substrate proteolysis.
