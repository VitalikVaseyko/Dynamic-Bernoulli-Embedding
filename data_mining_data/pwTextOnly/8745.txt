The circadian rhythms of liver glycogen, plasma glucose, corticosterone and insulin, and hepatic activity of PK, G6PDH, ME, Ac, CoA carbox. PEP-CK and GPT were studied in adult rats. Animals either received a mixed diet ad libitum (8% protein) or a protein meal (1.1 g protein) given at 05:00 or 17:00 h, with free access to a protein-free diet (separately fed). When the protein meal was ingested during the lighted period (17:00) the 24-hour average level of liver PEP-CK was greater than in rats consuming protein during darkness (05:00). In the latter case, modification of the circadian rhythm of liver glycogen and of circadian rhythm of liver PK, G6PDH, ME and Ac.CoA carbox. activity (increase of 24 h average level, extension of period of high activity, sudden increase after ingestion of protein meal) were observed. Conversely, the circadian rhythm of plasma insulin and corticosterone and of liver PEP-CK and GPT activity were only slightly affected by the mode of feeding.
