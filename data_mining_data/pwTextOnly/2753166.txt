In rabbit and sheep erythrocytes the concentrations of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate suffer important changes after birth, which differ in both species. The changes of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate correlate with the changes in the levels of the enzymatic activities involved in their synthesis. The change of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels in rabbit but not in sheep erythrocytes could be explained by the changes of the phosphofructokinase/pyruvate kinase and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase/2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase activity ratios.
