The hematological parameters of young (2-month-old) and old (2-year-old) mice were compared. No differences could be detected with the exception of an increased percentage of reticulocytes in the old animals suggesting that anemia in senescent mice does not occur. Red blood cell mean half-life in old mice was 8 +/- 0.8 days compared to 12 +/- 1 days in young mice. This reduced survival of red blood cell is not due to a different rate of cell phagocytosis in the reticulohistiocytic system of young and old animals since erythrocytes from young mice have the same mean half-life when injected both in young and old animals and vice versa. Thus, the old mice have a reduced red cell life-span but the same hematocrit of the young, suggesting that old animals possess a chronologically younger population of erythrocytes than do young animals. This has been confirmed by measuring the specific activities of some red blood cell age-dependent enzymes (hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase) that were found to be higher in the older animals, and by the separation of erythrocytes into different density (age) groups by Percoll/albumin density gradient centrifugation. However, the erythrocytes osmotic fragility, and the cellular contents of adenine and pyridine nucleotides, as well as the content of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and reduced glutathione, show that circulating erythrocytes in old animals constitute an heterogeneous cell population whose properties cannot be explained on the basis of a chronologically younger erythrocyte population. Furthermore, evaluation of cell components in hemopoietic tissues have shown an increased porportion of erythroid precursor cells in old animals confirming that old mice compensate for reduced red cell survival with an increased erythropoiesis.
