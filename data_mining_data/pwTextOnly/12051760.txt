The VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) receptor is a peripheral lipoprotein receptor expressing in fatty acid active tissues abundantly. In the Balb/c fasting mice, VLDL receptor as well as LPL (lipoprotein lipase), FAT (fatty acid translocase)/CD36, H-FABP (heart-type fatty acid-binding protein), ACS (acyl-CoA synthetase) and LCAD (long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) expressions increased. An electron microscopic examination indicated the lipid droplets that accumulated in the hearts of fasting Balb/c mice. During the development of SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats, VLDL receptor, LPL, FAT/CD36, H-FABP, ACS, and LCAD mRNAs concomitantly increased with growth. However, PK (pyruvate kinase) mRNA expression was negligible. In cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, VLDL receptor expression increased with days in culture. Oil red-O staining showed that cardiomyocytes after 7 days in culture (when the VLDL receptor protein is present) accumulated beta-migrating VLDL. Thereby, we showed that the cardiac VLDL receptor pathway for delivery of remnant lipoprotein particles might be part of a cardiac fatty acid metabolism.
