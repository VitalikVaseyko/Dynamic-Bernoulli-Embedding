Assay of maximal activities of 11 glycolytic enzymes in cell-free buffalo sperm extracts showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase had the lowest activities, suggesting regulation of fructolysis at steps catalysed by these enzymes. The ratios of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphofructokinase (0.67) and phosphoglycerate kinase/phosphofructokinase (4.60) are typical of cells exhibiting high Pasteur effect (50% for ejaculated buffalo spermatozoa). The regulatory nature of phosphofructokinase was shown through its modulation by ATP, AMP and inorganic phosphate. The determination of fructolytic intermediates and cofactors and calculation of mass action ratios for each enzymic step revealed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase catalysed reactions far removed from the equilibrium. A regulatory role by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase appeared to be most likely because triosephosphates and inorganic phosphate accumulated more under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions.
