AIM: Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is characterised by antimitochondrial antibody against the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC). Pyruvate oxidation to acetyl-CoA by PDC is a key step in the glycolytic system. Oestrogen-related receptor-alpha (ERRalpha) is functionally activated by inducible coactivators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and Bcl-3. Moreover, the PGC-1alpha-ERRalpha axis interrupts glycolytic metabolism through the upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), which functionally inhibits PDC-E1alpha and stimulates fatty acid oxidation. In this study, we investigated the PGC-1alpha-ERRalpha axis to clarify PDC dysfunction in CNSDC of PBC. METHODS: The expression of PGC-1alpha, Bcl-3, ERRalpha, PDK4 and PDC-E1alpha was examined by immunohistochemistry in liver sections from patients with PBC and controls. The expression of these molecules, the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase and PDC, and their alterations by starvation, a treatment used to induce PGC-1alpha expression, were examined in cultured human biliary epithelial cells (BECs). RESULTS: The nuclear expression of PGC-1alpha, Bcl-3 and ERRalpha was exclusively observed in CNSDC of PBC. Moreover, the expression of PDK4 and PDC-E1alpha was enhanced in CNSDC of PBC. In cultured BECs, the amplification of Bcl-3 and PDK4 mRNAs by reverse-transcription-PCR and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity were markedly increased but PDC activity was decreased according to the upregulation of PGC-1alpha. CONCLUSIONS: In CNSDC of PBC, the activation of the ERRalpha-PGC-1alpha axis was exclusively observed, suggesting the interference of PDC-related glycolytic function and the induction of the fatty acid degradation system. The switching of the cellular energy system is possibly associated with the pathogenesis of CNSDC in PBC.
