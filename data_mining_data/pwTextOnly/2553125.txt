Interactions of the glycolytic enzymes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose-phosphate isomerase, enolase, phosphoglycerate mutase, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase type-M, and lactate dehydrogenase type-H with tubulin and microtubules were studied. Lactate dehydrogenase type-M, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and aldolase demonstrated the greatest amount of co-pelleting with microtubules. The presence of 7% poly(ethylene glycol) increased co-pelleting of the latter four enzymes and two other enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and phosphoglycerate kinase with microtubules. Interactions also were characterized by fluorescence anisotropy. Since the KD values of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase for tubulin and microtubules were all found to be between 1 and 4 microM, which is in the range of enzyme concentration in cells, these enzymes are probably bound to microtubules in vivo. These observations indicate that interactions of cytosolic proteins, such as the glycolytic enzymes, with cytoskeletal components, such as microtubules, may play a structural role in the formation of the microtrabecular lattice.
