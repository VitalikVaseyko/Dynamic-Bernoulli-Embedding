Spinal cord compression by extramedullary hemopoietic tissue is a rare complication of hemolytic anemias. This is the first report of this complication in hemolytic anemia caused by pyruvate-kinase deficiency. Indium scan, computed tomography (CT) scan, and myelography were helpful in diagnosis. Surgery and radiotherapy were followed by complete recovery during a follow-up period of 12 months.
