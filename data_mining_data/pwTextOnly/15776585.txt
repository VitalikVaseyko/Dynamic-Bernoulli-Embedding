We reported a study about three candidate genes which may be involved in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 4 (PDK4), Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) and Fatty Acid Binding Protein 2 (FABP2). The reported mutation in the three candidate genes were tested for 179 black subjects from Dakar (Senegal) by PCR-RFLP techniques. There was no significant difference between both control and NIDDM subjects. The genotype frequency in the senegalese population was quite similar as compared to reported frequency in white populations excepted for PDK4 polymorphism. These results suggest that none of these gene variants is a major NIDDM predisposing locus for the negroid population of Senegal.
