OBJECTIVE: Activated leukocytes and their products play a significant role in reperfusion injury and cause microvascular occlusion--the 'no-reflow phenomenon'--which decreases coronary blood flow after the release of the aortic cross-clamp during open-heart surgery. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia in patients with right ventricular pressure or volume overloaded congenital heart disease undergoing intracardiac repair. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fourteen infants and children undergoing intracardiac repair for congenital heart defects were the subjects in this study. Leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia was employed in seven patients (Group I). For the control, terminal blood cardioplegia with leukocytes was employed in seven patients (Group II). In order to evaluate the myocardial anaerobic metabolism, the arteriovenous difference in the pyruvate and lactate levels was compared between both groups. Blood samples were taken simultaneously from both the arterial limb of the bypass circuit and the coronary sinus immediately after, and at 5, 10, and at 20 minutes after, the release of the aortic cross-clamp. RESULTS: The coronary arteriovenous difference in the pyruvate and lactate levels demonstrated that the myocardial anaerobic metabolism in Group II was significantly higher than in Group I. The delta excess lactate demonstrated that myocardial hypoxia in Group II persisted significantly longer than in Group I. There was a tendency for the creatine kinase-MB level at 6 hr after surgery to be lower in Group I than in Group II. CONCLUSION: Leukocyte-depleted terminal blood cardioplegia may reduce the myocardial anaerobic metabolism in patients with right ventricular pressure or volume overloaded congenital heart disease undergoing intracardiac repair.
