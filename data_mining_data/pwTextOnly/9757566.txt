The Escherichia coli polyphosphate kinase (PPK) has been known to catalyze the reversible transfer of phosphate molecules between ATP and polyphosphate (poly(P)). It has also been found that the PPK catalyzes the kination of not only ADP but also other nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) using poly(P) as a phosphate donor, yielding nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). We used the PPK and poly(P) in place of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenol pyruvate for NTP regeneration followed by synthesis of sugar nucleotides in a cyclic synthesis system for oligosaccharides. It was confirmed that the PPK efficiently catalyzed the UTP regeneration in the cyclic system of N-acetyllactosamine synthesis. This novel activity of PPK enables us to perform the practical synthesis of oligosaccharides.
