A practical study is presented of the influence of cell debris and polymer recycling upon the operation of two-stage aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) for the recovery of yeast bulk protein, pyruvate kinase and fumarase. Brewers' yeast was disrupted using one of two types of high-pressure homogenisers or a bead mill. The different cell debris suspensions were partitioned in a single PEG-phosphate ATPS extraction and the efficiency of solid-liquid separation was examined. A continuously operated two-stage ATPS process, using spray columns, is presented and practical problems of polymer recycling are discussed. Conclusions are drawn concerning the generic implementation and operational stability of ATPS in practical protein recoveries.
