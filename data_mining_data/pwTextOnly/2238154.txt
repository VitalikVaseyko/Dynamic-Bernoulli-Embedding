Thiamine-deficiency in animals induced by everyday subcutaneous administration of oxythiamine in a dose of 4, 40 and 100 mg/kg of weight for 10 days results in a decrease of the total activity of pyruvate kinase in the liver tissue and does not affect the mentioned index in the kidney and heart tissues. It is shown that as a result of the enzyme fractionation in the column with DEAE-cellulose the total activity of pyruvate kinase in the liver tissue of rats with thiamine-deficiency decreases due to L-isoform while the content of M-isoform remains unchanged. Thiamine deficiency does not affect kinetic characteristics of the L-isoform, extracted from the liver and this shows the absence of changes in the degree of phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase L-isoform under these conditions.
