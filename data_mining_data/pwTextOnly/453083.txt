A procedure has been developed to phenotype eight erythrocytic enzymes, phosphoglucomutase (PGM1), adenylate kinase (AK), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), adenosine deaminase (ADA), glyoxalase (GLO), esterase-D (EsD), acid phosphatase (AcP), and glutamic pyruvate transaminase (GPT) in one acrylamide gel and also to detect the presence of common abnormal hemoglobins. The agar overlay technic has been eliminated. This simplified procedure renders the phenotyping of erythrocytic enzymes practical in paternity testing.
