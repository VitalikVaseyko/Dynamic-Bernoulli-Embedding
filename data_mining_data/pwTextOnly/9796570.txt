We present one of the rarer causes of pregnancy-associated jaundice in the immediate puerperium. A 30-year-old multipara with pyruvate kinase deficiency became jaundiced within a few hours of delivery, following an uneventful pregnancy and labour at term. She responded to conservative management, the jaundice clearing and the altered liver function showing a steady return to normal. Pyruvate kinase deficiency may cause pregnancy-associated jaundice. A thorough investigation is still necessary to exclude other causes of jaundice in pregnancy and the puerperium.
