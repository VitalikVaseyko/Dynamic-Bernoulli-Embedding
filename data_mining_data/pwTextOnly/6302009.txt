The effect of adrenalectomy on specific activities of testicular hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glycogen concentration have been studied. A general increase in specific activities of all enzymes was seen after adrenalectomy in rats of all ages studied. However, lactate dehydrogenase activity and glycogen concentration in pre-pubertal rats alone were depleted with no alteration in pubertal and adult animals. This was accompanied by increased prolactin titres, but gonadotrophins and testosterone were unaltered. Dexamethasone treatment returned all enzyme activities and hormonal profiles to normal.
