The genome of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas extremaustralis was analyzed searching for genes involved in environmental adaptability focusing on anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulation, cold adaptation, exopolysaccharide production and degradation of complex compounds. Experimental evidences demonstrated the functionality of several of these pathways, including arginine and pyruvate fermentation, alginate production and growth under cold conditions. Phylogenetic analysis along with genomic island prediction allowed the detection of genes with probable foreign origin such as those coding for acetate kinase, osmotic resistance and colanic acid biosynthesis. These findings suggest that in P. extremaustralis the horizontal transfer events and/or gene redundancy could play a key role in the survival under unfavorable conditions. Comparative genome analysis of these traits in other representative Pseudomonas species highlighted several similarities and differences with this extremophile bacterium.
