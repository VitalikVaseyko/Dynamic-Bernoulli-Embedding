Changes in the profile of two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, in different regions of rat brain were studied under alloxan-induced diabetes. A regional variation of the effect of diabetes on brain was noted - the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum showed decreased activity of the enzymes, while the brain stem remained relatively unaffected. The changes in enzyme activities in the brain regions were more pronounced at the early days of diabetes, particularly at 8 days. Insulin administration to the diabetic animals restored the activity of the enzymes. The results indicate a regionally variable effect of diabetes on the two key glycolytic enzymes, and bring out a role of insulin in the regulation of brain glycolysis.
