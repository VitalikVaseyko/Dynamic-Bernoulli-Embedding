To examine whether nutritional supplementation with SkQ1 can reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo, Wistar rats were fed a regular diet supplemented with different doses of SkQ1 for two or three weeks. Control groups of rats were fed the same diet supplemented with NaBr. Anaesthetized rats were subjected to 40-min regional myocardial ischemia and 1-h reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method. SkQ1-fed rats (125 nmol/kg/day for two weeks and 250 nmol/kg/day for two and three weeks) revealed significantly smaller myocardial infarction and less lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) activity elevations in plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with the controls. This effect was combined with improvement of energy state of the area at risk at the end of reperfusion, namely, augmentation of adenine nucleotide content, two-fold increase in phosphocreatine, reduction of lactate accumulation and decrease of lactate/pyruvate ratio in myocardial tissue. Therefore, nutritional supplementation with SkQ1 renders the hearts resistant to ischemia-reperfusion injury affecting oxidative metabolism of postischemic cardiomyocytes.
