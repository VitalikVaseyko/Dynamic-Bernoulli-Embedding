Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI), (1)H and (13)C High-Resolution-Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) Spectroscopy, and genomic approaches were used to compare cerebral activation and neuronal and glial oxidative metabolism in ad libitum fed C57BL6/J leptin-deficient, genetically obese ob/ob mice. T(1)-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images across the hypothalamic Arcuate and the Ventromedial nuclei were acquired kinetically after manganese infusion. Neuroglial compartmentation was investigated in hypothalamic biopsies after intraperitoneal injections of [1-(13)C]glucose or [2-(13)C]acetate. Total RNA was extracted to determine the effects of leptin deficiency in the expression of representative genes coding for regulatory enzymes of hypothalamic energy pathways and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed enhanced cerebral activation in the hypothalamic Arcuate and Ventromedial nuclei of the ob/ob mice. (13)C HR-MAS analysis showed increased (13)C accumulation in the hypothalamic glutamate and glutamine carbons of ob/ob mice after the administration of [1-(13)C]glucose, a primarily neuronal substrate. Hypothalamic expression of the genes coding for glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and glutamine synthase was not significantly altered while pyruvate kinase expression was slightly upregulated. In conclusion, leptin deficiency associated with obesity led to increased cerebral activation in the hypothalamic Arcuate and Ventromedial nuclei, concomitant with significant increases in neuronal oxidative metabolism and glutamatergic neurotransmission.
