In order to assess the extent to which metabolism within the sheep placenta may influence the transfer of metabolites between mother and foetus at different stages of gestation the activities of enzymes concerned with some aspects of carbohydrate, amino acid and keton body metabolism were determined in placental cotyledons resected from ewes during the last three months of pregnancy. The activities of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), ATP citrate (pro-3S)-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8), citrate (si)-synthase (EC 4.1.3.7), acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-keto acid CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.5) per gram wet weight cotyledon do not change during the period studied. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.2), aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.1.1.42), ornithine-oxoacid aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.13) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) show an increase in activity between the third and fourth months of pregnancy whilst the activities of arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) and possibly pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1) show an increase in activity between the fourth and final months of pregnancy. Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) activity declines to one tenth of its activity during this later period. The absence of detectable activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) indicate that gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis from ammonia do not occur in the sheep placenta. It appears that the ability of the placenta to metabolise several substrates is achieved by the time the placenta reaches its maximum size at approximately 90 days.
