The autotroph Methanococcus maripaludis contained high levels of acetate-coenzyme A ligase, pyruvate synthase, pyruvate, water dikinase, pyruvate carboxylase, and the enzymes of the incomplete reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, citrate synthase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase were not detected. In contrast, the heterotroph Methanococcus sp. strain A3 contained acetate kinase, and acetate coenzyme A ligase was virtually absent.
