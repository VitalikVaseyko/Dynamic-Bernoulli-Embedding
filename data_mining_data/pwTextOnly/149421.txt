ATPase activity of actomyosin and activity of glycogenolytic enzymes were distinctly increased during postnatal period of development. Direct correlation was observed between the actomyosin ATPase and phosphofructokinase, phosphohexoisomerase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and "bound" fraction of aldolase. Kinetic patterns of phosphofructokinase (Km and Hill's coefficient) were not altered at the postnatal period. Formation of complexes between the contractile proteins and glycolytic enzymes appears to be important in development of contractile function.
