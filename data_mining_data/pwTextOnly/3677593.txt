1. PK and LDH activities in the muscle of Periophthalmodon schlosseri and Boleophthalmus boddaerti were at least 100-fold higher than their respective activities in the liver. 2. The ratio of PK:PEPCK in liver of B. boddaerti was smaller than that of P. schlosseri. 3. PK:PEPCK ratios in both fishes were intermediate between those of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. 4. MDH activity was higher than other enzymes assayed in the liver of both fishes. 5. The ratios of LDH:MDH in the liver of both mudskippers were comparable to those of anaerobic organisms. 6. AST was at least eight times more active than ALT in the liver of both fishes. 7. In the muscle of these mudskippers, the aspartate content was significantly less than that of alanine. 8. Exposure of these fishes to various experimental conditions led to changes in specific activities of PEPCK, LDH, AST and ALT.
