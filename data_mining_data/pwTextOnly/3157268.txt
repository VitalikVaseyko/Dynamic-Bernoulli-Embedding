Activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were studied in rat heart after emotional-painful stress and development of myocardium necrosis. The stress caused an activation of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase within 2 and 7 days, activity of pyruvate kinase was not altered. In myocardium necrosis developed after emotional-painful stress activity of phosphofructokinase was decreased within 2 days as compared with the animals, myocardial necrosis of which was produces using the routine procedures.
