An in vitro nuclear translocation system is described in which isolated rat liver nuclei were incubated in a defined buffered medium containing radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled exogenous proteins. The nuclei were rapidly recovered, extracted, and analyzed for the presence of associated radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled proteins. The isolated nuclei exhibited the same specificity for protein uptake as seen previously in vivo, accumulating simian virus 40 wild-type large-T antigen and p53 while excluding a cytoplasmic variant of large-T antigen (d10) and bovine serum albumin. The rapid nuclear accumulation of wild-type large-T antigen was shown to be selective and dependent upon the recognition of a wild-type nuclear location signal, ATP and temperature dependent, and unidirectional. Taken together, the data suggest that in our in vitro system the nuclear translocation of wild-type large-T antigen exhibits some of the characteristics of an active transport process.
