Chitin is the second most abundant organic compound on the planet and thus has been regarded as an alternative resource to petroleum feedstocks. One of the key challenges in the biological conversion of biomass-derived polysaccharides, such as cellulose and chitin, is to close the gap between optimum temperatures for enzymatic saccharification and microbial fermentation and to implement them in a single bioreactor. To address this issue, in the present study, we aimed to perform an in vitro, one-pot bioconversion of chitin to pyruvate, which is a precursor of a wide range of useful metabolites. Twelve thermophilic enzymes, including that for NAD(+) regeneration, were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and semi-purified by heat treatment of the crude extract of recombinant cells. When the experimentally decided concentrations of enzymes were incubated with 0.5 mg mL(-1) colloidal chitin (equivalent to 2.5 mM N-acetylglucosamine unit) and an adequate set of cofactors at 70 degrees C, 0.62 mM pyruvate was produced in 5 h. Despite the use of a cofactor-balanced pathway, determination of the pool sizes of cofactors showed a rapid decrease in ATP concentration, most probably due to the thermally stable ATP-degrading enzyme(s) derived from the host cell. Integration of an additional enzyme set of thermophilic adenylate kinase and polyphosphate kinase led to the deceleration of ATP degradation, and the final product titer was improved to 2.1 mM.
