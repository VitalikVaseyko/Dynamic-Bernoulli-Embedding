The effectiveness of gossypol as an antifertilizing agent is due to the severe injuries or death that this drug produces on spermatozoa and spermatides. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that spermatozoal lactic and malic dehydrogenases are inhibited by gossypol; and that these are more susceptible than the somatic enzymes. Notwithstanding, the in vivo effects on other somatic enzymes have been poorly analyzed. The present study shows that gossypol did not produce toxic effects on eight erythrocytic enzymes of male hamsters that were fed daily with 20 mg of gossypol/kg, for 1, 3, 5 or 10 days. The enzymatic activities analyzed were: adenylate kinase, hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose phosphoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglyceratokinase and pyruvate kinase.
