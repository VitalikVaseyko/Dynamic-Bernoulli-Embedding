The changes in vascular prostaglandin production are implicated in the derangement of vascular reactivity in diabetes. However, the mechanism of altered prostaglandin (PG) production in diabetes is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of high glucose on IL-1beta-induced PG production and the possible underlying mechanism in cultured vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). High glucose evoked an augmentation of IL-1beta-induced PG synthesis in a dose dependent manner and enhanced cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, which reached to maximum at 8-12 hours after stimulation. Western blot analysis supported the activity data. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, H-7 and chelerythrine, significantly inhibited the enhancement of IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression by high glucose. The activation of PKC by PMA resulted in marked increase of PG production in low glucose group, whilst this was not the case in high glucose group. Furthermore, glucose-enhancing effect was significantly suppressed by zopolrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor, and sodium pyruvate. These results suggest that the augmenting effect of high glucose on IL-1beta-induced PG production and COX-2 expression is, at least in part, due to increased glucose metabolism via sorbitol pathway following PKC activation.
