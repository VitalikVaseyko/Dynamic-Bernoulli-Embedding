Cord blood specimens from 513 normal Saudi neonates from the Eastern Province were screened for the deficiency of erythrocyte pyruvate kinase enzyme using the fluorescent spot test. The enzyme activity of the deficient specimens and 108 randomly selected samples was assayed spectrophotometrically. The results indicate that the incidence of this enzyme deficiency is 3.12% which is higher than that reported previously. The findings are compared with those reported by others and the possible factor responsible for the high incidence of this deficiency is discussed.
