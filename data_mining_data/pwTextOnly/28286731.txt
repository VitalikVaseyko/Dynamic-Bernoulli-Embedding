Pyruvate kinase (PK, EC 2.7.1.40) is an important glycolytic enzyme involved in multiple physiological and developmental processes. In this study, we demonstrated that cotton cytosolic pyruvate kinase 6 (GhPK6) was phosphorylated at serines 215 and 402. Phosphorylation of GhPK6 at serine 215 inhibited its enzyme activity, whereas phosphorylation at both serine sites could promote its degradation. The phosphorylation-mediated ubiquitination of GhPK6 was gradually attenuated during the cotton fiber elongation process, which sufficiently explained the increase in the protein/mRNA ratios. These results collectively provided experimental evidence that cotton fiber elongation might be regulated at the post-translational level.
