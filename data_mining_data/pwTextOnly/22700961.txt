The early initiation phase of acute inflammation is anabolic and primarily requires glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial glucose oxidation for energy, whereas the later adaptation phase is catabolic and primarily requires fatty acid oxidation for energy. We reported previously that switching from the early to the late acute inflammatory response following TLR4 stimulation depends on NAD(+) activation of deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SirT1). Here, we tested whether NAD(+) sensing by sirtuins couples metabolic polarity with the acute inflammatory response. We found in TLR4-stimulated THP-1 promonocytes that SirT1 and SirT 6 support a switch from increased glycolysis to increased fatty acid oxidation as early inflammation converts to late inflammation. Glycolysis enhancement required hypoxia-inducing factor-1alpha to up-regulate glucose transporter Glut1, phospho-fructose kinase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which interrupted pyruvate dehydrogenase and reduced mitochondrial glucose oxidation. The shift to late acute inflammation and elevated fatty acid oxidation required peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivators PGC-1alpha and beta to increase external membrane CD36 and fatty acid mitochondrial transporter carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1. Metabolic coupling between early and late responses also required NAD(+) production from nicotinamide phosphoryltransferase (Nampt) and activation of SirT6 to reduce glycolysis and SirT1 to increase fatty oxidation. We confirmed similar shifts in metabolic polarity during the late immunosuppressed stage of human sepsis blood leukocytes and murine sepsis splenocytes. We conclude that NAD(+)-dependent bioenergy shifts link metabolism with the early and late stages of acute inflammation.
