Tumor cells rely preferentially on anaerobic glycolysis rather than on respiration for ATP generation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. We explored the effects of glucose withdrawal on glioblastoma multiforme-derived cell lines and their nontransformed counterparts, normal human astrocytes. We found that glucose withdrawal induces extensive apoptosis in glioblastoma multiforme cells but not in normal astrocytes. In all cells examined, ATP levels are sustained on glucose withdrawal due to elevation of fatty acid oxidation and ensuing respiration; however, we show that oxidative stress generated in the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the direct cause of cell death in glioblastoma multiforme cells. Oxidative stress that only occurs in glioblastoma multiforme cells underlies the selective susceptibility to glucose withdrawal-induced apoptosis documented in the malignant cells. This study implicates glycolysis as a potentially efficient and selective target for glioblastoma multiforme treatment.
