Hybridization has the potential to exert pleiotropic effects on metabolism. Effects on mitochondrial enzymes may arise through incompatibilities in nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the enzyme complexes of oxidative phosphorylation. We explored the metabolic phenotype of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and their unidirectional F(1) hybrids (male bluegill x female pumpkinseed). In hybrids, glycolytic enzyme activities were indistinguishable from (aldolase, pyruvate kinase) or intermediate to (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucoisomerase) parentals, but complex IV activities aligned with pumpkinseed, both 30% lower than bluegill. In isolated mitochondria, the specific activities of complexes I, II, and V were indistinguishable between groups. However, both complex III and IV showed indications of depressed activities in hybrid mitochondria, though no effects on mitochondrial state 3 or state 4 respiration were apparent. The patterns in complex IV activities were due to differences in enzyme content rather than enzyme V(max); immunoblots comparing complex IV content with catalytic activity were indistinguishable between groups. The sequence differences in complex IV catalytic subunits (CO1, CO2, CO3) were minor in nature; however, the mtDNA-encoded subunit of complex III (cytochrome b) showed eight differences between bluegill and pumpkinseed, several of which could have structural consequences to the multimeric enzyme, contributing to the depressed complex III catalytic activity in hybrids.
