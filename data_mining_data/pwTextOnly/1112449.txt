Dietary regulation of jejunal glycolytic regulatory enzymes and disaccharidases were studied in 9 obese subjects, aged 9 to 18 years. These subjects were divided into two groups on the basis of altered carbohydrate metabolism as measured by circadian insulin levels and flux of glucose, inorganic phosphorus, and insulin measured during a 5-hr oral glucose tolerance test. Those patients with nocturnal hyperinsulinemia and abnormal carbohydrate flux showed no adaptation of jejunal enzymes. These data suggest that both glycolytic regulatory enzymes and disaccharidases are susceptible to insulin regulation.
