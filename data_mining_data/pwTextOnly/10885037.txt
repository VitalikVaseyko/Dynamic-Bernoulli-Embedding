The influence of thyroxine on the activities of enzymes of energy metabolism (hexokinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase) was investigated in bone marrow myeloid cells and blood neutrophils of 3-10-day old neonatal piglets. Data obtained suggest different responsiveness of energy metabolism enzymes to thyroxine action. Repeated hormone injections resulted in the preferential stimulation of enzymes involved in oxidative stages of carbohydrate catabolism in animal myelocaryocytes, while the activities of anaerobic enzymes in these cells were less affected. At the same time glycolytic enzymes in neutrophil granulocytes showed higher sensitivity to thyroxine action than enzymes catalyzing oxidative stages of energy metabolism.
