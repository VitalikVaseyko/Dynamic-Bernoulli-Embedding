Posthepatectomy coma was produced in 13 dogs and the cerebrums were biopsied for analysis of concentrations of glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, alpha-ketogulutarate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, adenosinetriphosphate, ammonia, and glutamine as well as for activities of glucokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme. There were no differences from normal in the brain glycolytic substrate concentrations. Four of the Krebs cycle substrates were significantly reduced, but not differently than in dogs sedated for 24 hours. The glycolytic pathway, Krebs cycle, and related enzyme activities were not significantly altered. Cerebral adenosine triphosphate concentration was unchanged but the concentrations of ammonia and glutamine increased threefold.
