A cDNA for the gene that encodes a human cytosolic thyroid hormone binding protein (p58) recently has been isolated and sequenced. Analysis of the p58 sequence indicates that it is identical to the subunit of pyruvate kinase, subtype M2. By in situ hybridization, the gene for p58 was mapped to 15q24-25. This localization shows that the p58 gene is not linked to the L-type of pyruvate kinase, which is located on chromosome 1. The p58 gene was found to be activated in several forms of cancer. Current localization will permit us to assess the effect of alterations involving chromosome 15 on the structure and activity of the p58 gene in neoplasms or chromosome syndromes.
