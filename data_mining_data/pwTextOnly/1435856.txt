The multiplication of malaria parasites within red blood cells is energy dependent. Since these parasites lack a functional tricarboxylic acid cycle, the energy needs of the parasite are met by anaerobic glycolysis of exogenous glucose. High levels of glycolytic enzymes such as fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase have been detected in infected erythrocytes. Here we report a 4-9 times increase in glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) activity of infected erythrocytes over that of normal erythrocytes. This increase is of parasitic origin, as additional enzyme bands were observed in lysates of infected erythrocytes. The expression of GPI parallels parasite maturation and reaches a maximum at the trophozoite/schizont stage. Two distinct but closely related activity patterns consisting of 3-4 GPI isoenzymes (not shown in normal erythrocytes) with neutral to weakly acidic isoelectric points were observed in 6 P. falciparum isolates tested by isoelectric focusing. The purified P. falciparum GPI has an apparent size of 66 kDa. No size variation was observed in the 6 P. falciparum isolates studied. Furthermore, antiserum raised against this protein in BALB/c mice specifically inhibits parasite encoded GPI activity while no effect was observed on host enzyme activity.
