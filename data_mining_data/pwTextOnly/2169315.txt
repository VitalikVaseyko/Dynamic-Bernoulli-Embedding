The combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and concanavalin A induces the expression of a new set of glycolytic isozymes in human peripheral lymphocytes. The induced isozyme for each enzyme tested (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) is usually the muscle form, which is often associated with rapidly dividing tumor cells. Increases in a specific isozyme can account for the 2-5-fold increase in specific activities of the enzyme induced by Con A plus PMA. Increased specific activities and the appearance of the new isozyme forms both occur relatively late, and are probably associated with the G1 or S phase of the cell cycle.
