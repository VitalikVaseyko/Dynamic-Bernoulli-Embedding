The inclusion of novel small molecules in crystallization experiments has provided very encouraging results and this method is now emerging as a promising alternative strategy for crystallizing 'problematic' biological macromolecules. These small molecules have the ability to promote lattice formation through stabilizing intermolecular interactions in protein crystals. Here, the use of 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (PTS), which provides a helpful intermolecular bridge between Leishmania mexicana PYK (LmPYK) macromolecules in the crystal, is reported, resulting in the rapid formation of a more stable crystal lattice at neutral pH and greatly improved X-ray diffraction results. The refined structure of the LmPYK-PTS complex revealed the negatively charged PTS molecule to be stacked between positively charged (surface-exposed) arginine side chains from neighbouring LmPYK molecules in the crystal lattice.
