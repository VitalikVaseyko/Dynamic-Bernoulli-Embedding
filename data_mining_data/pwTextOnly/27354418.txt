Siblings presented as neonates with severe jaundice and transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia. Next-generation sequencing revealed both to have three heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKLR), plus a heterozygous splice mutation in the beta-spectrin gene (SPTB). In addition, both have a different 5th mutation in a gene encoding other erythrocyte membrane proteins. The asymptomatic parents and all three asymptomatic siblings have different sets of these mutations. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
