Cancers are "reprogrammed" to use a much higher rate of glycolysis (GLY) relative to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), even in the presence of adequate amounts of oxygenation. Originally identified by Nobel Laureate Otto Warburg, this hallmark of cancer has recently been termed metabolic reprogramming and represents a way for the cancer tissue to divert carbon skeletons to produce biomass. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie this metabolic shift should lead to better strategies for cancer treatments. Malignant gliomas, cancers that are very resistant to conventional treatments, are highly glycolytic and seem particularly suited to approaches that can subvert this phenotype.
