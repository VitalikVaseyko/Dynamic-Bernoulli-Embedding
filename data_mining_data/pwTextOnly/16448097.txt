This report describes a procedure combining six enzymes native to Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhi, such as thymidine kinase (TK), thymidylate kinase (TMK), nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), pyruvate kinase (PK; for ATP regeneration), TDP-glucose synthetase (RfbA), and TDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (RfbB), with five enzymes from Streptomyces fradiae, such as TylX3, TylC1, TylC3, TylK, and TylC2, that resulted in the biosynthesis of TDP-l-mycarose from glucose-1-phosphate and thymidine. This two-stage one-pot approach can be readily applied to the synthesis of other unusual sugars.
