PDK1 is essential for T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, and PDK1-induced phosphorylation of PKCtheta is important for TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, inverse regulation of PDK1 by PKCtheta during T cell activation has not been investigated. In this study, we found that PKCtheta is involved in human PDK1 phosphorylation and that its kinase activity is crucial for human PDK1 phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry analysis of wild-type PKCtheta or of kinase-inactive form of PKCtheta revealed that PKCtheta induced phosphorylation of human PDK1 at Ser-64. This PKCtheta-induced PDK1 phosphorylation positively regulated T cell activation and TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, phosphorylation of human PDK1 at Ser-64 increased the stability of human PDK1 protein. These results suggest that Ser-64 is an important phosphorylation site that is part of a positive feedback loop for human PDK1-PKCtheta-mediated T cell activation.
