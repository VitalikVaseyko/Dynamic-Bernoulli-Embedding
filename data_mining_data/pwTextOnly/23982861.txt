Elevated aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (Warburg effect) has been observed in many tumor types including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which can often be detected clinically using FDG-PET. However, the role of glycolysis in supporting the growth of NPC cells and its therapeutic implications still remain to be investigated. In the present study, we showed that the LDH inhibitor oxamate significantly suppressed NPC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, yet exhibited minimum toxicity to normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells in vitro and was well tolerated in mice. Moreover, oxamate exhibited cytotoxic effect in NPC cells under hypoxia. Mechanistic study showed that oxamate significantly inhibited LDH activity, leading to a substantial decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production. Combination of oxamate with a mitochondrial respiratory complex I inhibitor resulted in a significant depletion of cellular ATP and a synergistic killing of cancer cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of glycolysis by oxamate is an effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of NPC and that combination of this compound with mitochondrial-targeted agents may improve the therapeutic activity.
