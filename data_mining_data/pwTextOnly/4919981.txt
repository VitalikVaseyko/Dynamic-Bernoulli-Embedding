Streptococcus diacetilactis required acetate, contained acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase, and incorporated both radioactive exogenous acetate and acetate from citrate into cell lipids. dl-alpha-Lipoic acid replaced acetate and was required for the oxidation of pyruvate. Stimulation of S. diacetilactis by citrate was found to depend on pyruvate oxidation. Resting cells of the organism produced acetate from 73% of the pyruvate they utilized. However, molar growth yields from glucose were not greater under aerobic compared to anaerobic conditions or when lipoic acid or citrate plus lipoic acid was used in the medium in place of acetate. Data indicate that the growth of S. diacetilactis is limited by the rate of acetyl-coenzyme A synthesis, that the rate of synthesis from pyruvate is higher than the rate from acetate, and that lack of acetyl-coenzyme A not required for growth limits the production of diacetyl and precludes the formation of adenosine triphosphate from acetyl-coenzyme A.
