Individual muscle fibers from the rat anterior tibialis and soleus muscles were each analyzed in duplicate for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27), malate dehydrogenase (MDH, EC 1.1.1.37), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35), fumarate hydrotase (EC 4.2.1.2), glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), fructose-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), and creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2). A few fibers were also analyzed for adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3). In general, there was a wide and almost continuous spectrum of coordinated enzyme activities. In the tibialis muscle, two fiber groups could be clearly distinguished on the basis of MDH activity. The high MDH group had on the average lower LDH activity, but there was a great deal of overlap in LDH between the two groups. Less overlap was observed for phosphorylase and fructose-bisphosphatase, both inversely related to MDH. Only one main group of fibers (presumably slow twitch) was found in the soleus muscle, although enzyme activities also covered a wide range. These soleus fibers were clearly distinguished from the high MDH tibialis group by much lower activities of LDH, pyruvate kinase, and fructose-bisphosphatase.
