In isolated rat hepatocytes, the short-term regulation of the M2 pyruvate kinase isozyme by insulin is demonstrated. This hormone dependence, which is a function of dose and incubation time, is checked by the activity of the pyruvate kinase, using enzyme assay, cellulose acetate electrophoresis and electroimmunodiffusion methods.
