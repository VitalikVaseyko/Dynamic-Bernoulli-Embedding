Drug resistance is one of the main causes of colon cancer recurrence. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and availability of therapeutic options remains limited. Here we show that expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is positively correlated with drug resistance of colon cancer cells and induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in drug-resistant but not drug-sensitive cells. Knockdown of PDK4 expression sensitizes colon cancer cells to 5-FU or oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and increases the effectiveness of 5-FU in the inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model in vivo In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that TGFbeta mediates drug resistance by regulating PDK4 expression and that 5-FU induces PDK4 expression in a TGFbeta signaling-dependent manner. Mechanistically, knockdown or inhibition of PDK4 significantly increases the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and survivin. Importantly, studies of patient samples indicate that expression of PDK4 and phosphorylation of Smad2, an indicator of TGFbeta pathway activation, show a strong correlation and that both positively associate with chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. These findings indicate that the TGFbeta/PDK4 signaling axis plays an important role in the response of colorectal cancer to chemotherapy. A major implication of our studies is that inhibition of PDK4 may have considerable therapeutic potential to overcome drug resistance in colorectal cancer patients, which warrants the development of PDK4-specific inhibitors.
