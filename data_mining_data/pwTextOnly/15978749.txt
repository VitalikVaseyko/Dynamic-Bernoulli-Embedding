Depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or treatment with mitochondrial poison CCCP initiates mitochondrial stress signaling, which operates through altered Ca2+ homeostasis. In C2C12 rhabdomyoblasts and A549 human lung carcinoma cells mitochondrial stress signaling activates calcineurin and a number of Ca2+ responsive factors including ATF, NFAT, CEBP/delta and CREB. Additionally, PKC and MAP kinase are also activated. A number of nuclear gene targets including those involved in Ca2+ storage/release (RyR1, calreticulin, calsequestrin), glucose metabolism (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, Glut4), oncogenesis (TGFbeta1, cathepsin L, IGFR1, melanoma antigen) and apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bid, Bad, p53) are upregulated. Mitochondrial stress in both C2C12 myoblasts and A549 cells induced morphological changes and invasive phenotypes. These cells also showed markedly increased resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis that is a hallmark of highly invasive tumors. Our results describe a new mechanism of altered nuclear gene expression and phenotypic changes triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA damage.
