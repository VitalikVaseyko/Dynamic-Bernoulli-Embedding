A delayed wasting syndrome similar to that induced by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was observed in male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 3,3', 4,4'-tetrachloroazoxybenzene (TCAOB) and 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB). After a slow growth period, all treatment animals (25 mg/kg, i.p., 2 doses per week) exhibited a starvation-like syndrome characterized by reduced food intake, dramatic loss of body weight and subsequent death. Although the growth of all major organs in the treatment animals was affected, the thymus appeared severely atrophied. The growth kinetics during the earlier phase were further analyzed using serially-killed rats receiving TCAOB. In addition, TCAOB was found to markedly depress the specific activity (mumol/min/g wet liver) of glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and pyruvate kinase in the liver. Significant changes in the levels of cytochrome P-450, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and malic enzyme in the liver were also observed.
