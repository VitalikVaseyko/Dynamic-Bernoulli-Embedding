A study was made of the effect of food with a high glucose content given to albino rats for a long time on blood sugar and insulin. Changes in the activity of hexokinase and pyruvickinase in the liver were also investigated. Food with a high glucose content given to rats for 90--100 days led to an increase in the blood sugar and insulin level. The activity of hexokinase and pyruvickinase rose markedly by the 40th--60th day of feeding, and fell to the initial level by the 80th--90th day. Thus, in case of a prolonged action of insulin on the organism as a result of prolonged stimulation of the insular apparatus of the pancreas by glucose there developed signs of peculiar insulin-resistance.
