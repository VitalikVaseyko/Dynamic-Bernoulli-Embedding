Escherichia coli FB-04(pta1), a recombinant L-tryptophan production strain, was constructed in our laboratory. However, the conversion rate (L-tryptophan yield per glucose) of this strain is somewhat low. In this study, additional genes have been deleted in an effort to increase the conversion rate of E. coli FB-04(pta1). Initially, the pykF gene, which encodes pyruvate kinase I (PYKI), was inactivated to increase the accumulation of phosphoenolpyruvate, a key L-tryptophan precursor. The resulting strain, E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF, showed a slightly higher L-tryptophan yield and a higher conversion rate in fermentation processes. To further improve the conversion rate, the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS) was disrupted by deleting the ptsH gene, which encodes the phosphocarrier protein (HPr). The levels of biomass, L-tryptophan yield, and conversion rate of this strain, E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF/ptsH, were especially low during fed-batch fermentation process, even though it achieved a significant increase in conversion rate during shake-flask fermentation. To resolve this issue, four HPr mutations (N12S, N12A, S46A, and S46N) were introduced into the genomic background of E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF/ptsH, respectively. Among them, the strain harboring the N12S mutation (E. coli FB-04(pta1)DeltapykF-ptsHN12S) showed a prominently increased conversion rate of 0.178 g g(-1) during fed-batch fermentation; an increase of 38.0% compared with parent strain E. coli FB-04(pta1). Thus, mutation of the genomic of ptsH gene provided an alternative method to weaken the PTS and improve the efficiency of carbon source utilization.
