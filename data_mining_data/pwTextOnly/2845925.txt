Purified chicken liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase was phosphorylated either from fructose 2,6-bis[2-32P]phosphate or fructose 2-phosphoro[35S]thioate 6-phosphate. The turnover of the thiophosphorylated enzyme intermediate as well as the overall phosphatase reaction was four times faster than with authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2-phosphorothioate 6-phosphate was 10-100-fold less potent than authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in stimulating 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and pyrophosphate:fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase, but about 10 times more potent in inhibiting fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. The analogue was twice as effective as authentic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in stimulating pyruvate kinase from trypanosomes.
