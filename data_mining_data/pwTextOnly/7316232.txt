On the basis of performed tests, we observed the change of pattern of pyruvate kinase isoenzyme in a malignant testicular tumor (only isoenzyme K) and the same isoenzyme in the tissue of other testis not being tumorously changed. In control group pyruvate kinase isoenzyme K and M was observed. Similarly, another pattern of aldolase isoenzymes in tumorous tissue was stated (AC) comparing with control group (arrangement AC, BC). The changes referred also to the activity of both examined enzymes in tumorous tissue and in the tissue of testis not being tumorously changed. The authors suggest the existence of a factor with depressor characteristics, which is produced by neoplasm and changes the function of genes that are responsible for synthesis examined isoenzymes in the tissue not being tumorously changed.
