Hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, the regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic sequence, showed progressive increases in their activities with the rise of parasitaemia in Plasmodium knowlesi-infected rhesus monkey serum and red blood cells. Chloroquine therapy cleared the parasitaemia in 72 h and brought the elevated levels of these enzymes back to almost normal in about 30 days.
