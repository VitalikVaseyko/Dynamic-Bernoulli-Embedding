A congenital erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency was found in a 72-year old female patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Erythrocyte PK deficiency was associated with an increase in the activity of hexokinase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase in erythrocytes as well as a decrease in acetylcholinesterase, glutathione reductase and glucosephosphate isomerase activities. The enzymatic abnormalities were accompanied by alterations in hemoglobin and in i antigen content of erythrocyte membrane. In addition, bone marrow ultrastructural studies showed dyshemopoietic changes in all blood cell lines and especially in erythroblasts. The present findings confirm the close relationship between CMML and acquired dyserythropoietic syndromes and constitute a new observation of the infrequent association of hereditary erythrocyte enzymopathies and leukemia. A survey of the literature is presented.
