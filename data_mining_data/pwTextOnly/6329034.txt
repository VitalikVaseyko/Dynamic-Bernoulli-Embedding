The requirements for in vitro mitochondrial protein synthesis have been studied using isolated mitochondria from cultured adrenal Y-1 tumor cells from mice. By reducing the reaction volume to 50 microliter we were able to assay in replicate the requirements for various reaction components using trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable counts for a quantitative evaluation with time of incubation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography was also used for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the translation products. With the optimized system, 1 to 3% of added [35S]methionine was incorporated. The products of mitochondrial protein synthesis range from 70,000 to 5000 molecular weight. Major autoradiographic bands were observed at 38,000, 31,000, 23,000, 20,000, and 5600 molecular weight as separated on 10 to 20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels; however, 20 to 30 protein products of various molecular weights were discernible. Mitochondrial concentrations of 0.8 to 1.4 mg/ml of incubation gave the better incorporation of [35S]methionine per milligram of protein. Total [35S]methionine incorporated into mitochondrial protein was greatest at 25 degrees C after 90 min. Chloramphenicol at 10 micrograms/ml inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis by more than 50% and at 100 micrograms/ml inhibited incorporation by more than 95%. Cycloheximide had no effect on incorporation at less than 1.0 mg/ml. Magnesium and ATP in a molar ratio of one to one at 5 mM gave optimal incorporation. Other energy generating systems using oxidative phosphorylation to supply ATP for protein synthesis were not as effective as ATP and 5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 20 micrograms/ml pyruvate kinase and 5 mM a-ketoglutarate. In contrast to in vitro yeast mitochondrial protein synthesis, no enhancement of in vitro adrenal cell mitochondrial protein synthesis was found with GTP or its analogs. The buffers N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, N-(tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl)glycine, and N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid were superior to Tris-HCl for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Optimal pH for [35S]methionine incorporation into mitochondrial proteins was pH 7.0 to 7.6. Potassium at 50 to 90 mM gave the best incorporation of [35S]methionine, and the higher molecular weight products of translation were enhanced at these concentrations. Sodium at 10 to 40 mM had no effect; however, 100 mM sodium inhibited label incorporation by 30%. Calcium at 100 microM inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis by approximately 50%, and at 1.0 mM little if any incorporation occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
