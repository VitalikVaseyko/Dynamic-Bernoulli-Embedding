Aberrant expression of microRNA (miR)-1 has been observed in many human malignancies. However, the function and underlying mechanism of miR-1 remains elusive. To address the specific role of miR-1 in tumor glycolysis using the gain- or loss-of-function studies. Metabolic studies combined with gene expression analysis were performed in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated aberrant expression of miR-1 in aerobic glycolysis, the Warburg effect, in cancer cells. MiR-1 suppressed aerobic glycolysis and tumor cell proliferation via inactivation of Smad3 and targeting HIF-1alpha, leading to reduce HK2 and MCT4 expression, which illustrated a novel pathway to mediate aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-1 mimics significantly decreased tumor glycolysis, including lactate production and glucose uptake, and cell proliferation, and these effects were reversed by ectopic expression of Smad3. Importantly, endogenous Smad3 regulated and interacted with HIF-1alpha, resulting in increasing activity of Smad3, and this interaction was dramatically abolished by addition of miR-1. We further demonstrated that Smad3 was central to the effects of miR-1 in colorectal cancer cells, establishing a previously unappreciated mechanism by which the miR-1/Smad3/HIF-1alpha axis facilitates the Warburg effect to promote cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. The results indicate that miR-1 may have an essential role as a tumor suppressor, suggesting its potential role in molecular therapy of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
