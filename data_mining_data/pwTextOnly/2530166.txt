Effect of three antiandrogens: cyproterone acetate (5 mg/day, sc), flutamide (5 mg/day, sc) and STS-557 (5 mg/day, po) and an estrogen, estradiol dipropionate (5 micrograms/day, sc) on some key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism was investigated in adult rat epididymis and ventral prostate. Antiandrogens were administered for 21 days and estrogen for 14 days. All of them caused a significant decrease in the weight of epididymis, seminal vesicles and ventral prostate. A significant decrease in the specific activities of enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) occurred only in the organs of estrogen treated rats; activities of some of the enzymes were lowered also in the prostate of STS-557 treated rats. Flutamide and cyproterone acetate were ineffective in this regard. The possible factors responsible for the ineffectiveness of synthetic antiandrogens in influencing epididymal metabolism are discussed.
