Inorganic pyrophosphate can function as phosphate donor in protein phosphorylation reactions in yeast mitochondria. It was shown that, when PPi substitutes for ATP as inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, maximal activity is reached after a lag-period of 30-60 minutes. 32P-labeling of peptides shows that [32P]PPi gives about 25% of the labeling obtained by [gamma-32P]ATP in the protein kinase reaction. The PPi dependent phosphorylation is increased several fold by the presence of cold ATP.
