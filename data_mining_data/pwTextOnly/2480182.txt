Specific fluorescent probes have been used to monitor changes in erythrocyte membranes in the first stages of the hemolytic process induced by irradiation with visible light in the presence of protoporphyrin IX. Although no change, or even a slight increase of fluorescence anisotropy, occurred with two probes having a preferential binding to membrane proteins, such as fluorescamine and 3-pyrene maleimide, the fluorescence anisotropy of two lipophilic probes, namely diphenyl-hexatriene and anilino-naphthalene sulfonate, underwent a substantial decrease upon irradiation. Concomitantly, a dramatic decrease of ATPase activity and an increase of thiobarbituric-reacting substances were observed in erythrocyte membranes. Instead, there was no effect on the activities of the intracellular enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that protoporphyrin-sensitized irradiation induces, primarily in the erythrocyte membrane, the peroxidation of the lipid component, which results in an increase of the fluidity of the bilayer. Hemolysis eventually occurs because of an osmotic imbalance resulting from the combination of increased passive diffusion and decreased active ion transport.
