Changes in the profile of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and Pyruvate kinase (PK) from rat brain regions were studied following thyroidectomy. A regional variation of thyroidectomy on brain was observed; cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum showed decreased activity of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. The activity in the brain stem did not change. Administration of triiodothyronine to the thyroidectomized rats restored the activity to near control levels. The results suggest a role of the thyroid hormones in the regulation of glycolysis in brain.
