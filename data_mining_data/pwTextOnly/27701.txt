The kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) extracted from the mycelia of Neurospora crassa were examined at physiological pH to determine the role of the enzyme in the regulation of glycolysis. The velocity curve with the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adenosine diphosphate, are hyperbolic. The effect of magnesium, potassium, or calcium on the enzyme is influenced by the pH but not to the extent that would change their role as cofactor or inhibitor. Adenosine triphosphate and citrate remain strong inhibitors even with changes in pH. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate and glucose-6-phosphate are the dual positive effectors at physiological pH. Valine is the only amino acid that inhibits the enzyme at a concentration range of valine found in the mycelial juice. Thus, the properties of the enzyme at physiological pH are significantly different from those observed at neutral pH of the usual assay conditions, but its role as a key regulator of glycolysis is unchanged.
