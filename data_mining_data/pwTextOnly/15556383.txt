Painted turtles hibernating during winter may endure long-term exposure to low temperature and anoxia. These two conditions may affect the aerobic capacity of a tissue and might be of particular importance to the cardiac muscle normally highly reliant on aerobic energy production. The present study addressed how hibernation affects respiratory characteristics of mitochondria in situ and the metabolic pattern of turtle myocardium. Painted turtles were acclimated to control (25 degrees C), cold (5 degrees C) normoxic and cold anoxic conditions. In saponin-skinned myocardial fibres, cold acclimation increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and decreased apparent ADP-affinity. Concomitant anoxia did not affect this. Creatine increased the apparent ADP-affinity to similar values in the three acclimation groups, suggesting a functional coupling of creatine kinase to mitochondrial respiration. As to the metabolic pattern, cold acclimation decreased glycolytic capacity in terms of pyruvate kinase activity and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHD) activity. Concomitant anoxia counteracted the cold-induced decrease in pyruvate kinase activity and increased creatine kinase activity. In conclusion, cold acclimation seems to increase aerobic and decrease anaerobic energy production capacity in painted turtle myocardium. Importantly, anoxia does not affect the mitochondrial functional integrity but seems to increase the capacity for anaerobic energy production and energy buffering.
