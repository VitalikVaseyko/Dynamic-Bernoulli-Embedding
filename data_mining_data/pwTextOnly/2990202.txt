Since the discovery of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and of pyruvate kinase deficiencies, erythroenzymopathies associated with hereditary hemolytic anemia have been extensively investigated. Kinetic and electrophoretic studies have shown that most, if not all, erythroenzymopathies are caused by the production of a mutant enzyme. Except for a few enzymes that are abundant in blood and tissues, it is difficult to obtain enough sample to study the functional and structural abnormalities of mutant enzymes associated with genetic disorders in man. The primary structures of only two normal red cell enzymes which can cause hereditary hemolytic anemia, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and adenylate kinase, have been determined. Single amino acid substitutions of PGK variants have been found, and the identification of the exact molecular abnormalities of such variants has helped us to understand the accompanying functional abnormality. Gene cloning makes possible the identification of the DNA sequence that codes for enzyme proteins. Recently, human complementary DNA (cDNA) for aldolase, PGK, G6PD, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) have been isolated, and the nucleotide sequences for PGK and ADA determined. In the near future, human cDNA sequencing should permit identification of the gene alteration that gives rise to the mutant enzymes.
