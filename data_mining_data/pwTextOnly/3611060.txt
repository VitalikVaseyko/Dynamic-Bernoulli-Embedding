The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase consists of a catalytic subunit (Kc) and a basic subunit (Kb) which appear to be anchored to the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core component (E2) by another subunit, referred to as protein X (Rahmatullah, M., Jilka, J. M., Radke, G. A., and Roche, T. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6515-6523). We determined the catalytic requirements for reduction and acetylation of the lipoyl moiety in protein X and linked those changes in protein X to regulatory effects on kinase activity. Using fractions prepared by resolution and proteolytic treatments, we evaluated which subunits are required for regulatory effects on kinase activity. With X-KcKb fraction (treated to remove the mercurial agent used in its preparation), we found that the resolved pyruvate dehydrogenase component, the isolated inner domain of E2 (lacking the lipoyl-bearing region of E2), and the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component directly utilize protein X as a substrate. The resulting reduction and acetylation of protein X occurs in association with enhancement of kinase activity. Following tryptic cleavage of E2 and protein X into subdomains, full acetylation of the lipoyl-bearing subdomains of these proteins is retained along with the capacity of acetylating substrates to stimulate kinase activity. All kinase-containing fractions, including those in which the Kb subunit was digested, were inhibited by pyruvate or ADP, alone, and synergistically by the combination suggesting that pyruvate and ADP bind to Kc. Our results suggest that the Kb subunit of the kinase does not contribute to the observed regulatory effects. A dynamic role of protein X in attenuating kinase activity based on changes in the mitochondrial redox and acetylating potentials is considered.
