Blood lymphocytes of children with oncology diseases were studied in smears compared with healthy ones examined from the closely selected group. The following two methods were used: the traditional in hematology method of smear staining for detection of blood formula and lymphocyte indices and the staining with novel cytobiochemical method including 60-min incubation in biochemical medium for estimation of the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and their ratio, that can serve as a measure of respiration and glycolysis--Warburg effect, typical of tumor. The great increase in lymphocyte size by addition of lactate was found in blood smears of patients with tumors. This effect was not pronounced by addition of succinate and in cells of healthy persons. Changes in the structure of the cells in patients were also related to the changes in the activity of enzymes studied. These changes can be considered as transition of metabolism and the structure of cells to the state in tumor. Cytobiochemical method allows for higher diagnostic sensitivity of patient examination and efficiency of medical care of patients with oncological diseases.
