The African cichlid, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae is a eurytopic fish that exhibits high levels of developmental plasticity in response to dissolved oxygen availability. In this study, F1 offspring from three sites in the Mpanga River drainage of Western Uganda characterized by different dissolved oxygen (D.O.) regimes were reared under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. After 1 year, enzymes were measured to determine the tissue metabolic capacity of four different tissues: muscle, heart, brain and liver. The enzymes measured were pyruvate kinase [PK], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], citrate synthase [CS], and cytochrome C oxidase [CCO], and an additional two, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), were examined in the liver only. Individuals reared under hypoxia exhibited elevated levels of LDH and CCO in the heart; and depressed activity levels of brain CS and liver CCO and MDH relative to normoxia-reared sibs. Results from this study demonstrate that long-term exposure to hypoxia during development can induce changes in the metabolic capacities of P. multicolor. This flexibility may be important in facilitating persistence in variable and/or novel environments, and in the face of increasing global hypoxia.
