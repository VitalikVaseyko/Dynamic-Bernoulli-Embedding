Four of 8 definite heterozygous female carriers determined by PCR amplification of tandem CAG repeat of the AR gene, from 4 families of X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy (X-BSNP) showed extensive high amplitude motor unit potentials in examined muscles although all subjects were neurologically normal. Plasma creatine kinase, myoglobin, myosin light chain, lactate and pyruvate were all normal even in the carriers who showed EMG abnormalities. Muscle biopsy showed a type 2 fiber preponderance and possible very mild type 2 fiber grouping in a carrier with an EMG abnormality. These results suggest that a mutant AR gene may express subclinical phenotypic manifestations in a subpopulation of the heterozygous females of X-BSNP.
