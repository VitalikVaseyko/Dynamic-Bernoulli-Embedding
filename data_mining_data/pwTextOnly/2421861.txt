Physiological changes in host cell model membranes (intact human erythrocytes and ghosts) as a consequence of bacterial adhesion were studied with special reference to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Membrane activities examined were transport of K+, Cl- ions, pyruvate kinase, Na-K-dependent ATPase, and cAMP. We found that K+ and Cl- transport were affected, more so in membranes with attached pilated (P+) organisms than in those with apilated (P-) isogenic strains. In N. gonorrhoeae and in several other species of gram-negative bacteria studied, hemagglutination titres were directly correlated with effects on anion transport, suggesting that perturbations in anion transport are an immediate result of adhesion. Of three P+ gonococcus strains tested, two depressed Na-K-ATPase activity in the membrane, indicating a possible effect on the Na-K pump. Pyruvate kinase activity associated with the membrane appeared to be stimulated by attached gonococci, again by P+ strains to higher levels than P- organisms. Clearly, some enzyme properties of host membranes are intrinsically affected by bacterial adhesion. Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils were also investigated, and with some exceptions, changes observed in leukocyte enzyme activities tended to parallel those in erythrocytes. Since hypochlorous acid production is considered to be an important microbicidal mechanism in neutrophils, interference with Cl- transport could jeopardize their role in host defense.
