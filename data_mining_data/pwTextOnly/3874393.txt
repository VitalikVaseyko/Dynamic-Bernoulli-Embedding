In the absence of creatine phosphate, MgATP produced relaxation of rigor tension in chemically-skinned right papillary muscles of the rat, the half maximal effect being obtained at 1.8 mM MgATP. In the presence of 12 mM creatine phosphate and 250 microM ADP, a decrease in MgATP concentration even to 10(-9) M never induced rigor tension. At a very low MgATP concentration (10(-6) M), the half maximal relaxing effect was obtained with 2 mM creatine phosphate, a value close to the Km of isolated MM-creatine kinase for this substrate, or with 14 microM MgADP, a value 5 times lower than the reported Km. An exogenous MgATP regenerating system (phosphoenol pyruvate + pyruvate kinase) was not able to fully relax the fibres. When MM-creatine kinase was inhibited by fluorodinitrobenzene, the dependency of rigor tension on MgATP became the same as it was without creatine phosphate. After washing out the fluorodinitrobenzene the addition of exogenous MM-creatine kinase for half an hour fully relaxed rigor tension; moreover, this effect persisted even after prolonged washout. These results show that endogenous MM-creatine kinase is able to ensure maximal efficiency of myosin ATPase by producing a localized high MgATP/MgADP ratio; they also suggest the existence of rapidly exchangeable binding sites for MM-creatine kinase in cardiac myofibrils.
