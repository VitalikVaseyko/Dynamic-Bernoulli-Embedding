Specific activities of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase and pyruvate dehydrogenase were studied in virgin, pregnant, lactating and involuting rat mammary glands. An inverse relationship was evident between cAMP binding to protein kinase(s) and the activities of the above enzymes in lactating rat mammary glands. Results suggested that free Ca2+ concentration may also contribute to control of the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in these glands. However, no consistent change was observed between the activities of these enzymes and cAMP binding in young, pregnant and involuting rat mammary glands. Calmodulin levels paralleled bound Ca2+ except in lactating rats. Almost all parameters studied peaked on day 8 of lactation.
