The addition of glyoxylate to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf discs inhibited glycolate synthesis and photorespiration and increased net photosynthetic (14)CO(2) fixation. This inhibition of photorespiration was investigated further by studying the effect of glyoxylate on the stimulation of photosynthesis that occurs when the atmospheric O(2) level was decreased from 21 to 3% (the Warburg effect). The Warburg effect is usually ascribed to the increased glycolate synthesis and metabolism that occurs at higher O(2) concentrations. Photosynthesis in control discs increased from 59.1 to 94.7 micromoles of CO(2) per gram fresh weight per hour (a 60% increase) when the O(2) level was lowered from 21 to 3%, while the rate for discs floated on 15 millimolar glyoxylate increased only from 82.0 to 99.7 micromoles of CO(2) per gram fresh weight per hour (a 22% increase). The decrease in the O(2) sensitivity of photosynthesis in the presence of glyoxylate was explained by changes in the rate of glycolate synthesis under the same conditions.The rate of metabolism of the added glyoxylate by tobacco leaf discs was about 1.35 micromoles per gram fresh weight per hour and was not dependent on the O(2) concentration in the atmosphere. This rate of metabolism is about 10% the amount of stimulation in the rate of CO(2) fixation caused by the glyoxylate treatment on a molar carbon basis. Glyoxylate (10 millimolar) had no effect on the carboxylase/oxygenase activity of isolated ribulose diphosphate carboxylase. Although the biochemical mechanism by which glyoxylate inhibits glycolate synthesis and photorespiration and thereby decreases the Warburg effect is still uncertain, these results show that cellular metabolites can regulate the extent of the Warburg effect.
