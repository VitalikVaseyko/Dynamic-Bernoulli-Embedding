A circumsporozoite protein-specific monoclonal antibody (N2H6D5) was injected into malaria-infected mosquitoes to determine its effect on the sporogonic cycle. After injection of antibody into mosquitoes (100 ng each), positive immunofluorescence (measured on air-dried sporozoites) reactions in hemolymph extracts were observed at a dilution of 1:1000. At 72 hr postinjection the levels dropped to 1:10. Sporozoites coinjected with antibody did not invade the salivary glands. In naturally infected mosquitoes, sporozoites were released over a period of 3 to 4 days. Therefore, mosquitoes were injected twice. The first injection was a day before the beginning of sporozoite release and the second, 2 days later. Sporozoite invasion of the salivary glands was assessed 3 days after the second injection, by microscopic examination of dissected glands. At this stage, all oocysts had completed maturation and released the sporozoites. Salivary gland infections were totally prevented in mosquitoes given two injections of 100 ng N2H6D5. Hence, sustained presence of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies in the hemolymph can render female Aedes aegypti refractory to Plasmodium gallinaceum.
