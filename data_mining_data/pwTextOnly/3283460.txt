The myocardial oxidation of fatty acids and glucose, the predominant substrates for aerobic metabolism, is impaired after cardioplegic arrest for coronary revascularization. Because lactate can be readily metabolized to pyruvate, it may be the preferred substrate for aerobic metabolism after cardioplegic arrest when arterial concentrations are elevated. Nineteen patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization with blood cardioplegia were randomized to receive LOW (nine patients, no exogenous lactate) or HIGH (10 patients, a perioperative infusion of Ringer's lactate) arterial lactate concentrations. Coronary sinus catheterization and lactate labeled with carbon 14 permitted calculation of myocardial oxygen consumption and lactate oxidation which were significantly increased during reperfusion in the group with HIGH arterial lactate concentrations. Atrial pacing at 110 beats/min on cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in myocardial lactate production (suggesting ischemic anaerobic metabolism) in the LOW lactate group, but atrial pacing increased lactate consumption and oxidation in the HIGH lactate group (suggesting increased aerobic metabolism). Systolic function (the relation between end-systolic pressure and volume) as assessed by nuclear ventriculography 3 hours postoperatively was significantly better (p less than 0.05 by analysis of covariance) in the HIGH lactate group. Postoperative myocardial creatine kinase release was significantly lower in the HIGH lactate group, which suggested less perioperative ischemic injury. Lactate was the preferred substrate for myocardial oxidative metabolism after cardioplegic arrest, and the higher arterial lactate concentrations improved myocardial metabolic and functional recovery and reduced perioperative ischemic injury.
