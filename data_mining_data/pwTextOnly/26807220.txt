Over several years, scientists investigating cancer have focused their efforts on elucidating the mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis, with the aim of finding a way to inhibit this process. These mechanisms, however, only explain the process of cancer metastasis, but do not explain why cancer would metastasize in the first place. Cancer metastasizes due to several factors, namely attack by the immune system, lack of oxygen and necessary nutrients, large amounts of lactic acid produced by glycolysis and increased cell death. Therefore, the majority of the presently available treatments for cancer also bear the potential to induce metastasis. Thus, it is crucial in medical practice to minimize the risk of cancer metastasis during a time when there are no effective means to inhibit this process.
