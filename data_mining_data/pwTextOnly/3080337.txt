Four overlapping cDNA clones for L-type pyruvate kinase (PK-L) were isolated from carbohydrate-induced rat liver cDNA libraries. They contained all the coding sequence of the enzyme from the 7th codon and the entire 3'-untranslated extension up to the poly(A) tail. The sequence of the first 7 codons and that of the 5'-untranslated region were determined by primer extension. The analyzed PK-L mRNA has 19 5'-untranslated bases, 1629 coding bases and 1281 3'-untranslated bases without the poly(A) tail; it corresponds to the heavier, 3.2 kb species of the L-type mRNAs. The codons for the phosphorylatable site are located at the 5'-end of the messenger. The unusually long 3'-untranslated extension contains a repetitive element complementary to the 'brain-specific' identifier sequence described by Sutcliffe et al. [(1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 4942-4946].
