The molecular architecture of the rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.13) tetramer has been determined to 2.7-A resolution. Solution of the three-dimensional structure of rabbit muscle aldolase utilized phase information from a single isomorphous Pt(CN)4(2-) derivative, which was combined with iterative-phase refinement based upon the noncrystallographic 222-fold symmetry exhibited by the tetramer subunits. The electron-density map calculated from the refined phases (mf = 0.72) was interpreted on the basis of the known amino acid sequence (363 amino acids per subunit). The molecular architecture of the aldolase subunit corresponds to a singly wound beta-barrel of the parallel alpha/beta class structures as has been observed in triose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, phosphogluconate aldolase, as well as others. Close contacts between tetramer subunits are virtually all between regions of hydrophobic residues. Contrary to other beta-barrel structures, the known active-site residues are located in the center of the beta-barrel and are accessible to substrate from the COOH side of the beta-barrel. Biochemical and crystallographic data suggest that the COOH-terminal region of aldolase covers the active-site pocket from the COOH side of the beta-barrel and mediates access to the active site. On the basis of sequence studies, active-site residues as well as residues lining the active-site pocket have been totally conserved throughout evolution. By comparison, homology in the COOH-terminal region is minimal. It is suggested that the amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal region may be, in part, the basis for the variable specific activities aldolases exhibit toward their substrates.
