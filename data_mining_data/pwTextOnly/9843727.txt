86Rb fluxes through ATP-regulated K+ (KATP) channels in membrane vesicles derived from basolateral membranes of Necturus small intestinal epithelial cells as well as the activity of single KATP channels reconstituted into planar phospholipid bilayers are inhibited by the presence of ADP plus phosphoenolpyruvate in the solution bathing the inner surface of these channels. This inhibition can be prevented by pretreatment of the membranes with 2, 3-butanedione, an irreversible inhibitor of pyruvate kinase (PK) and reversed by the addition of 2-deoxyglucose plus hexokinase. The results of additional studies indicate that PK activity appears to be tightly associated with this membrane fraction. These results, together with considerations of the possible ratio of Na+-K+ pumps to KATP channels in the basolateral membrane, raise the possibility that "cross talk" between those channels and pumps (i.e., the "pump-leak parallelism") may be mediated by local, functionally compartmentalized ATP-to-ADP ratios that differ from those in the bulk cytoplasm.
