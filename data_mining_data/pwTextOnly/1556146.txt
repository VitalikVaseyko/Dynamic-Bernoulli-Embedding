During a complete cell cycle of rat thymocytes stimulated by concanavalin A and interleukin 2, the activity and mRNA level of pyruvate kinase reached a maximum (8-12-fold increase) 48 h after stimulation coinciding with the S-phase of the cell cycle. Increases of cellular enzyme activity, pyruvate kinase protein, and mRNA levels are correlated up to 48 h of culture. Afterwards pyruvate kinase activity and mRNA levels decrease, whereas the pyruvate kinase protein continues to increase throughout mitosis. This change of specific pyruvate kinase activity points to a posttranslational modification of the enzyme besides its transcriptional regulation. The presence of the M2-type isozyme was determined by the following methods: (a) native cellulose acetate electrophoresis and activity staining, (b) Northern blot hybridization with M1- and M2-specific cDNA probes, and (c) determination of kinetic parameters. The isozyme pattern did not change during the cell cycle progression. The induction of pyruvate kinase is completely abolished by 2-difluoromethylornithine-mediated polyamine depletion. However, the proportion of hybridizable pyruvate kinase mRNA was not affected. These data suggest the requirement of polyamines for efficient translation rather than transcription during cell growth.
