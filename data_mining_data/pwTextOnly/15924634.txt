OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of proteomics between the cerebellum and frontal lobe of the aged. METHOD: Proteins were isolated from human cerebellums and frontal lobes and separated by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then stained with silver or colloidal coomassie blue to produce a high-resolution map of the proteome. Selected proteins from this map were in-gel digested with trypsin and the resulting tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and MALDI TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometric data were used to identify the proteins through searches of the SWISSPROT protein sequence database. RESULTS: Three up-regulated protein spots in 2D gels of cerebellums were found as compared with those of frontal lobes. These protein spots were identified as antioxidant protein 2, creatine kinase precursor, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C. Two down-regulated proteins in cerebellums were identified as pyruvate kinase M1 isozyme and glial fibrillary acidic protein. 30 common proteins, the expressions of which were not altered between cerebellums and frontal lobes, were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: These data will be used for future studies of differential protein expression in neurological disorders. Some proteins are useful for discovering the molecular mechanisms of degenerative dementia and brain aging.
