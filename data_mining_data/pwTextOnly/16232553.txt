Although acetate biosynthesis in Escherichia coli provides an important intermediary for ATP synthesis, its accumulation inhibits both cell growth and protein production. Since pyruvate provides the largest flux to acetate and is central to the problem of acetate production, acetate accumulation could be reduced or abolished if the pyruvate pool for the TCA cycle was reduced. To examine this possibility, various pyruvate kinase (pyk) and phosphotransferase system (pts) mutants were tested for acetate production in batch cultures with glucose as the only carbon source. The pykA pykF mutant exhibited significant reductions in the specific growth rate and acetate production compared with the wild-type strain. Interestingly, in the case of pts and pts pyk mutants in which increased biomass yields were observed in comparison with the wild-type strain, no acetate production was detected. Therefore, these mutants are potentially useful for higher production of recombinant proteins. The results from the continuous cultivation performed using the wild-type strain at various dilution rates, suggest acetate reduction as a consequence of both genetic changes and growth rate diminutions.
