To investigate the existence of dynamic adenine nucleotide (AdN) compartment in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, we used reconstituted systems consisting of (i) functional intact liver and heart mitochondria and (ii) pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenolpyruvate, both competing for ADP either formed in the intermembrane space by adenylate kinase or added directly into, or regenerated by ATPase within, the extramitochondrial space. It is shown that ADP formation in the mitochondrial intermembrane space is a prerequisite for a dominating oxidative phosphorylation in reconstituted systems, suggesting dynamic ADP compartmentation in that space.
