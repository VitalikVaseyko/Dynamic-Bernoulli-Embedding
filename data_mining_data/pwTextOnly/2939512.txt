The mean levels of activity of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were found to be significantly higher in fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients than in those from age-matched controls and heterozygotes. This indicates that the activity of the glycolytic pathway is increased in fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.
