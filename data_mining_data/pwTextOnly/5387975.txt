1. Erythrocytes from normal and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient humans were subjected to hydrogen peroxide diffusion to oxidize the GSH. Studies were carried out in the presence and absence of chromate to inhibit glutathione reductase and with or without the addition of glucose. 2. The GSH content of erythrocytes from other species was oxidized by subjecting them to hydrogen peroxide diffusion in the presence of chromate and glucose. 3. Chromate (1.3mm) inhibited glutathione reductase by about 80%, whereas glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were not inhibited. 4. The GSSG formed was transported from the erythrocytes to the medium. 5. The transport rate of GSSG from glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes subjected to hydrogen peroxide diffusion in the presence of chromate was comparable with that from normal and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes. 6. The rate of transport of GSSG from erythrocytes of various species studied could be ranked: pigeon>rabbit>rat>donkey>man>dog>horse>sheep>chicken>fish.
