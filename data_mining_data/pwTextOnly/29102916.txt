OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of insulin-loaded trimethylchitosan nanoparticles on certain destructive effects of diabetes type one. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three control groups (n=5) and two treatment groups (n=5). The control groups included normal diabetic rats without treatment and diabetic rats treated with the nanoparticles. The treatment groups included diabetic rats treated with the insulin-loaded trimethylchitosan nanoparticles and the diabetic rats treated with trade insulin. The experiment period was eight weeks and the rats were treated for the last two weeks. RESULT: The livers of the rats receiving both forms of insulin showed less severe microvascular steatosis and fatty degeneration, and ameliorated blood glucose, serum biomarkers, and oxidant/antioxidant parameters with no significant differences. The gene expression of pyruvate kinase could be compensated by both the treatment protocols and the new coated form of insulin could not significantly influence the gene expression of glucokinase (p<0.05). The result of the present study showed the potency of the nanoparticle form of insulin to attenuate hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation in diabetes, which indicate the bioavailability of insulin-encapsulated trimethylchitosan nanoparticles.
