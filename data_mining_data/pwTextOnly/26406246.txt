Hypoxia induced oxidative stress incurs pathophysiological changes in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes by promoting translocation of p53 to mitochondria. Here, we investigate the cardio-protective efficacy of nanocurcumin in protecting primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes (HVCM) from hypoxia induced damages. Hypoxia induced hypertrophy was confirmed by FITC-phenylalanine uptake assay, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels and cell size measurements. Hypoxia induced translocation of p53 was investigated by using mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore blocker cyclosporin A (blocks entry of p53 to mitochondria) and confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial damage in hypertrophied HVCM cells was evaluated by analysing bio-energetic, anti-oxidant and metabolic function and substrate switching form lipids to glucose. Nanocurcumin prevented translocation of p53 to mitochondria by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and de-stressed hypertrophied HVCM cells by significant restoration in lactate, acetyl-coenzyme A, pyruvate and glucose content along with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKalpha) activity. Significant restoration in glucose and modulation of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 levels confirmed that nanocurcumin mediated prevention of substrate switching. Nanocurcumin prevented of mitochondrial stress as confirmed by c-fos/c-jun/p53 signalling. The data indicates decrease in p-300 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) mediated histone acetylation and GATA-4 activation as pharmacological targets of nanocurcumin in preventing hypoxia induced hypertrophy. The study provides an insight into propitious therapeutic effects of nanocurcumin in cardio-protection and usability in clinical applications.
