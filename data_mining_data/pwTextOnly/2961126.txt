Acute alcohol intoxication (2.5 g/kg) increased content of glucose and lactate in brain hemispheres cortex, thalamic region and brain stem. Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were activated in cortex, while the enzymatic activity was unaltered in thalamus and brain stem. The more distinct metabolic alterations in brain cortex might occur in response to the effect of alcohol primarily on brain cortex functions during the acute phase. Simultaneous administration of ethanol and metronidazole led to an increase in content of glucose and in activity of phosphofructokinase as well as to a decrease in lactate and in pyruvate kinase activity in all the brain structures studied.
