Pyruvate kinase muscle type 2 (PKM2) exhibits post-translational modifications in response to various signals from the tumor microenvironment. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a crucial signal in the tumor microenvironment that promotes cell growth and survival in many human cancers. Herein, we report that AKT directly interacts with PKM2 and phosphorylates it at Ser-202, which is essential for the nuclear translocation of PKM2 protein under stimulation of IGF-1. In the nucleus, PKM2 binds to STAT5A and induces IGF-1-stimulated cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that PKM2 acts as an important factor inducing STAT5A activation under IGF-1 signaling. Concordantly, overexpression of STAT5A in cells deficient in PKM2 expression failed to restore IGF-induced growth, whereas reconstitution of PKM2 in PKM2 knockdown cells restored the IGF-induced growth capacity. Our findings suggest a novel role of PKM2 in promoting the growth of cancers with dysregulated IGF/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling.
