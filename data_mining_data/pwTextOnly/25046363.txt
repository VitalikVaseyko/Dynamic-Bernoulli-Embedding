PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of using a hybrid Maximum-Entropy/Nonlinear Least Squares (MEM/NLS) method for analyzing the kinetics of hyperpolarized dynamic data with minimum a priori knowledge. THEORY AND METHODS: A continuous distribution of rates obtained through the Laplace inversion of the data is used as a constraint on the NLS fitting to derive a discrete spectrum of rates. Performance of the MEM/NLS algorithm was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations and validated by fitting the longitudinal relaxation time curves of hyperpolarized [1-(13) C] pyruvate acquired at 9.4 Tesla and at three different flip angles. The method was further used to assess the kinetics of hyperpolarized pyruvate-lactate exchange acquired in vitro in whole blood and to re-analyze the previously published in vitro reaction of hyperpolarized (15) N choline with choline kinase. RESULTS: The MEM/NLS method was found to be adequate for the kinetic characterization of hyperpolarized in vitro time-series. Additional insights were obtained from experimental data in blood as well as from previously published (15) N choline experimental data. CONCLUSION: The proposed method informs on the compartmental model that best approximate the biological system observed using hyperpolarized (13) C MR especially when the metabolic pathway assessed is complex or a new hyperpolarized probe is used.
