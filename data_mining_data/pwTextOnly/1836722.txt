Enzymes of various glycolysis stages, i.e. hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, were detected in cyclosporine-producing organisms belonging to Tolypocladium. The initial activity of the enzymes in the highly active strain was much higher than that in the starting low active strain. During the fermentation the activity of the glycolysis enzymes per 1 mg of mycelium protein in the both strains increased. This was accompanied by a decrease in respiration activity. Therefore, there was a direct correlation between cyclosporine biosynthesis and glycolytic activity of the mycelium in Tolypocladium sp.
