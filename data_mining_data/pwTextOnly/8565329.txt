Uniparental embryos have been instrumental in studying imprinting because contributions from the parental genomes can be determined unambiguously. In this study, we set out to identify imprinted genes showing differential expression between parthenogenetic and fertilized embryos during preimplantation and early postimplantation stages of development. We identified three genes--apolipoprotein E, pyruvate kinase-3, and protein phosphatase 1 gamma--that represent excellent candidates for imprinted genes, based on the results of the differential screen, their function in differentiation and the cell cycle, and their location within imprinted chromosomal regions. In addition, two novel genes expressed in trophoblast were identified, 1661 and RA81. These genes, together with four known imprinted genes, H19, Igf2r, Igf2, and Snrpn, showed evidence of expression from both parental alleles in early stage embryos, indicating a role for postfertilization processes in regulating imprinted gene function.
