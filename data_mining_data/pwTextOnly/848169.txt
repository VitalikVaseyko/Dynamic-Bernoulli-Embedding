In a series of benign or semimalignant connective tissue proliferations (4 desmoids, 1 recurrence of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 4 fibromas, 1 neurofibroma, 3 keloids, 3 Dupuytren's contractures) and a normal fascia for comparison the pattern of 18 enzymes from different metabolic pathways was investigated. It should be clarified whether alterations of the enzyme pattern wouldoccur, asthey are found in malignant tumours. The activity of most of the enzymes investigated increased about twofold in the latter of two extirpations (16 months interval) of a recurring desmoid. In the recurrence of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and in a recurrance of a fibroma a remarkably high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase was found. High activities of these enzymes are known to be characteristic of experimental tumours of animals and human malignant neoplasms. Therefore it is assumed that these differences from the normal patternof enzyme activity are related to recidivity and may be regarded as first signs of a deviation from benignity. Based on these results further studies haveto be done with the aim to find a biochemical tool for, evaluation and prognosis of the course of these diseases.
