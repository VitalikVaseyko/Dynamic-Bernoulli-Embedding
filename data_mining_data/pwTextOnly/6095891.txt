Aldehyde analogues of the normal alcohol substrates induce ATPase activities by glycerokinase (D-glyceraldehyde), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (2,5-anhydromannose 6-phosphate), fructokinase (2,5-anhydromannose or 2,5-anhydrotalose), hexokinase (D-gluco-hexodialdose), choline kinase (betaine aldehyde), and pyruvate kinase (glyoxylate). Since purified deuterated aldehydes give V and V/K isotope effects near 1.0 for glycerokinase, fructokinase with 2,5-anhydro[1-2H]talose, hexokinase, choline kinase, and pyruvate kinase, the hydrates of these almost fully hydrated aldehydes are the activators of the ATPase reactions. Fructose-6-phosphate kinase and fructokinase with 2,5-anhydro[1-2H]mannose show V/K deuterium isotope effects of 1.10 and 1.22, respectively, suggesting either that both hydrate and free aldehyde may be activators (predicted values are 1.37 if only the free aldehyde activates the ATPase) or, more likely, that the phosphorylated hydrate breaks down in a rate-limiting step on the enzyme while MgADP is still present and the back-reaction to yield free hydrate in solution is still possible. 18O was transferred from the aldehyde hydrate to phosphate during the ATPase reactions of glycerokinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, fructokinase, and hexokinase but not with choline kinase or pyruvate kinase. Thus, direct phosphorylation of the hydrates by the first four enzymes gives the phosphate adduct of the aldehyde, which decomposes nonenzymatically, while with choline kinase and pyruvate kinase the hydrates induce transfer to water (metal-bound hydroxide or water with pyruvate kinase on the basis of pH profiles). Observation of a lag in the release of phosphate from the glycerokinase ATPase reaction at 15 degrees C supports the existence of a phosphorylated hydrate intermediate with a rate constant for breakdown of 0.035-0.043 s-1 at this temperature. Kinases that phosphorylate creatine, 3-phosphoglycerate, and acetate did not exhibit ATPase activities in the presence of keto or aldehyde analogues (N-methylhydantoic acid, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and acetaldehyde, respectively), possibly because of the absence of an acid-base catalytic group in the latter two cases. These analogues were competitive inhibitors vs. the normal substrates, and in the latter case, the hydrate of acetaldehyde was shown to be the inhibitory species on the basis of the deuterium isotope effect on the inhibition constant.
