In nine unrelated Portuguese patients with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient anaemia, whose symptoms ranged from a mild chronic haemolytic anaemia to a severe anaemia presenting at birth and requiring multiple transfusions, the PK-LR gene mutations were identified and correlated with their phenotypes. Five different mutations were identified, three of them for the first time: a missense mutation 1670G --> C on exon 12 and two 5' splice donor site (GT) mutations on intron 8 [IVS8(+2)T --> G] and intron 10 [IVS10(+1)G --> C]. Two previously described missense mutations, 1456C --> T and 993C --> A, were also found. The genotype/phenotype correlation showed that patients with two missense mutations or with a missense mutation and a splicing mutation had a mild haemolytic anaemia. The three patients with severe anaemia, who were transfusion dependent until splenectomy, were homozygous for the splicing site mutations IVS10(+1)G --> C or IVS8(+2)T --> G.
