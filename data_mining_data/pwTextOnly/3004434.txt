Addition of insulin (10(-8)M) to hepatocytes, incubated either in the absence or in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of glucagon, caused the reactivation of pyruvate kinase and simultaneously provoked a transient stimulation of pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity (40-70% over control values). The stimulatory effect of insulin on pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity was dose-dependent (ED50 = 1 to 2 X 10(-11)M) and persisted after Sephadex G-25 filtration or ammonium sulfate precipitation of hepatocytes extracts. Our results demonstrate that insulin exerts a short-term regulation on hepatic pyruvate kinase phosphatase activity.
