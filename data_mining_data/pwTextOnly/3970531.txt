Rat brain pyruvate kinase was purified to near homogeneity by a three-step process involving ammonium sulfate precipitation and phosphocellulose and Blue-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The enzyme migrated on polyacrylamide gel along with a commercial sample of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. The enzyme showed a hyperbolic relationship with phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, with apparent Km's of 0.18 and 0.42 X 10(-3) M, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by ATP, the effect being more pronounced at unsaturating concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate. L-Phenylalanine was found to be a strong inhibitor of the enzyme, with the Ki for inhibitor being 0.11 mM. The inhibition by phenylalanine was more pronounced at pH 7.4 than at pH 7.0, and appeared to be competitive with phosphoenolpyruvate. L-Alanine and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate prevented the inhibition of the enzyme by phenylalanine. Ca2+ was found to be a strong inhibitor of the enzyme, and the inhibition was more marked at saturating phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. The kinetic properties of the purified brain pyruvate kinase suggest that the enzyme may be distinct from the muscle or liver enzymes.
