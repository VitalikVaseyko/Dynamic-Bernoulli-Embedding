We describe here a useful metabolic engineering tool, multiple-gene-promoter shuffling (MGPS), to optimize expression levels for multiple genes. This method approaches an optimized gene overexpression level by fusing promoters of various strengths to genes of interest for a particular pathway. Selection of these promoters is based on the expression levels of the native genes under the same physiological conditions intended for the application. MGPS was implemented in a yeast xylose fermentation mixture by shuffling the promoters for GND2 and HXK2 with the genes for transaldolase (TAL1), transketolase (TKL1), and pyruvate kinase (PYK1) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FPL-YSX3. This host strain has integrated xylose-metabolizing genes, including xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulose kinase. The optimal expression levels for TAL1, TKL1, and PYK1 were identified by analysis of volumetric ethanol production by transformed cells. We found the optimal combination for ethanol production to be GND2-TAL1-HXK2-TKL1-HXK2-PYK1. The MGPS method could easily be adapted for other eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms to optimize expression of genes for industrial fermentation.
