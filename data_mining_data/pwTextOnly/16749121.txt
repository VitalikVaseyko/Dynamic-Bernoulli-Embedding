1. Ethionine-treated mice showed a marked depletion in liver glycogen, a decrease of glycogen-synthetase activity, an increase in activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the solubilization of phosphorylase. 2. The administration of cortisol or glucose did not alleviate these changes but the effect of ethionine was completely prevented in animals given methionine as well as ethionine. 3. The activities of the following enzymes were unchanged: hexokinase, glucokinase, glucose 6-phosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase.
