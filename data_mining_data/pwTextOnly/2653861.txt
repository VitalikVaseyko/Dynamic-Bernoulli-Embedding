The sequence of the gene encoding pyruvate kinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was re-determined because of failures with oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis experiments involving a region thought to contain a string of five contiguous non-preferred codons. This region was found to be difficult to sequence and was shown to have three extra bases when compared with the published sequence [(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2193-2201]. The revised sequence demonstrates that the yeast pyruvate kinase gene does not have a cluster of non-preferred codons, and that it therefore is not an example of the class of genes which possibly exhibit translational control by the presence of non-preferred codons.
