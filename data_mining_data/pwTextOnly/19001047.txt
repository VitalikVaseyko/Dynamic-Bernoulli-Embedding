Acute exercise performance represents a major metabolic challenge for the skeletal muscle, but also for the liver as the most important source of energy. However the molecular adaptation of the liver to one single bout of exercise is largely unknown. C57BL/6 mice performed a 60 min treadmill run at high aerobic intensity. Liver, soleus and white gastrocnemius muscle were removed immediately after exercise. The single bout of exercise resulted in a very rapid and pronounced induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes and regulators of metabolism or transcription: glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase; 3-fold), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4; 4.8-fold), angiopoietin-like 4 (2.1-fold), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 (5.1-fold), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha; 3-fold). In soleus and white gastrocnemius muscle the up-regulation of IRS-2 and PDK4 was less pronounced compared with the liver and no significant induction of PGC-1alpha could be detected at this early time point. Activation of AMPK was found in both liver and white gastrocnemius muscle as phosphorylation of Thr-172. The induction of endogenous insulin secretion by a glucose load directly after the exercise bout resulted in a significantly higher PKB/Akt phosphorylation in the liver of exercised mice. The markedly enhanced IRS-2 protein amount, and presumably reduced serine/threonine phosphorylation of the IRS proteins induced by the acute exercise could be responsible for this enhanced action of insulin. In conclusion, acute exercise induced a rapid and pronounced transcriptional adaptation in the liver, and regulated hepatic IRS proteins leading to improved cellular insulin signal transduction.
