The content of estradiol receptors in the mammary glands of virgin female mice, and the capacity of this hormone to induce RNA synthesis, hexokinase, pyruvatkinase, and glucose-6-phosphoric dehydrogenase in the glands was studied. H3-estradiol binding to the mammary glands was found to be highly specific: only estradiol, and, to a lesser degree, estron, competed with H2-estradiol for the binding sites, while progesterone and hydrocortisone failed to affect the binding of H3-estradiol. As determined by the method of exchange of the receptor-bound endogenous hormone for the labeled exogenous one, the value of H3-estradiol specific binding was 4.3+/-1.5 10(-15) M/mg protein. Under the influence of estradiol the incorporation of H3-adenine and H3-orotic acid into the RNA of the mammary glands increased by 70%, and activity of the enzymes under study was almost doubled.
