A new, highly fluorescent adenosine triphophate (ATP) analog, 1,N(6) ethenoadenosine triphosphate, has been synthesized. Its fluorescence properties, including the long fluorescence lifetime and the possibility of detection at very low concentrations, in conjunction with its activity in the representative enzyme systems here reported, make it a valuable probe of enzymic mechanism and structure.
