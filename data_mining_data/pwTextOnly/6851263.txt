In 11 patients on CAPD with persisting anemia the survival of red cells labelled with 51Cr, red cell mass and the levels of several enzymes within red cells were measured. 51Cr red cell survival was shortened in 9/11 (mean +/- SD:20.0 +/- 4.9 days) and correlated with red cell mass, i.e. with the degree of anemia (r = 0.79, P less than 0.01). Determinations of the levels of enzymes of the hexose monophosphate shunt and the glycolytic pathway revealed no obvious defects in red cell metabolism. The level of hexokinase (HK) was normal whereas the activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD), glutathione reductase (GR) and pyruvate kinase (PK) as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased significantly. CAPD did not eliminate the hemolytic component of anemia in the majority of these patients.
