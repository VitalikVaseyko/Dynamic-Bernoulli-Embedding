The concentrations of following metabolites were determined in freeze-clamped gastrocnemius muscle samples: glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. dihydroxyacetone phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, glycerol 3-phosphate, glycerol, creatine phosphate, creatine, glycerate 3-phosphate, glycerate 2-phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, inorganic phosphate. The results showed that within the limits of experimental error, concentration homeostasis for this metabolites is founded at least in some cases on equilibria between enzymic transformations. Discrepancies between constant mass ratios measured in this study and equilibrium constants allow the free energy variation delta G to keep creatine phosphate at high concentration to be calculated. For the phosphoglycerate mutase system, the equilibrium constant in controls and trained animals is unchanged and corresponds to that in vitro. Training hindered glycolysis and favoured phosphorylation of creatine by glycerol 3-phosphate. Metabolites of the pyruvate kinase and hexokinase system cannot be homogeneously distributed in one space. The creatine kinase system is also separated from the hexokinase und pyruvate kinase system. A compartition of glycolytic process in gastrocnemius muscle seems to be inferred from these results.
