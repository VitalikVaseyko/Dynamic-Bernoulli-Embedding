Two enzymatic assay procedures for the measurement of 2,5-anhydrohexitol fructose analogs have been devised. Both procedures are based on the measurement of ADP formed during enzymatic phosphorylation of the analogs either by hexokinase or by fructokinase. The actual measurement makes use of the coupled assay system using pyruvate kinase, PEP, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADH. Both systems can be used to measure fructose and appropriate analogs at cuvette concentrations up to 0.10 mM. The hexokinase procedures allows the measurement of fructose, 2,5-anhydromannitol, and 2,5-anhydromannose. Glucose, which also reacts, can be removed by pretreatment of the samples with glucose oxidase. The fructokinase procedure allows the measurement of fructose, 2,5-anhydromannitol, 2,5-anhydroglucitol, and 2,5-anhydrotalitol.
