Hypoxia relaxes endothelium-denuded bovine coronary arteries (BCA) through mechanisms that do not appear to involve reactive oxygen species, prostaglandins, or nitric oxide. Because of similarities in the relaxation of BCA to hypoxia (Po(2) = 8-10 Torr) and inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) including 6-aminonicotinamide and epiandrosterone, we measured NADPH and NADP and found that hypoxia caused NADPH oxidation (decreased NADPH/NADP). The relaxation to hypoxia was similar to previously reported properties of relaxation to PPP inhibitors in that both responses were associated with glutathione oxidation and depressed intracellular calcium release and calcium influx-mediated contractile responses. Inhibitors of potassium channels had minimal effects on these relaxation responses. Relaxation to hypoxia and PPP inhibitors were attenuated by a thiol reductant (3 mM dithiothreitol) and by eliciting contraction with an activator of protein kinase C (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). In the presence of contraction to U-46619, relaxation to hypoxia and PPP inhibitors were attenuated by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitor 200 microM cyclopiazonic acid and by 10 mM pyruvate. Hypoxia decreased BCA levels of glucose-6-phosphate but not ATP. Pyruvate prevented the hypoxia-elicited decrease in glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione oxidation, and it increased NADPH levels under hypoxia to levels observed under normoxia. Thus hypoxia causes a metabolic stress on the PPP that promotes BCA relaxation through processes controlled by lowering the levels of cytosolic NADPH.
