T-cell vaccination (TCV), the application of irradiated activated T cells, has been shown to prevent effectively and treat experimental autoimmune diseases. It has been reported that anti-lymphocytic antibodies induced by TCV were capable of strongly inhibiting T-cell proliferation and of ameliorating experimental autoimmune disease. The present study was undertaken to characterize the antigen specificity of these Abs. We used activated mouse ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cells (OVA-T) as vaccine immunized mice. By combination of 2-DE, 2-D Western blot and Q-TOF mass spectrometry we have identified 11 antigens in activated T cells that were recognized by the anti-T-cell Abs. The resulting antigenic molecules included calreticulin (CRT), ERp57, Vimentin, HSP70-4, tubulin beta5 chain, coronin-1A, pyruvate kinase, ATP synthase beta chain and transketolase most of which belong to so-called damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). CRT, ERp57 and vementin were further examined by Western blot and cellular ELISA to identify molecular targets which may be involved in the TCV immunotherapy. On the basis of our results, gamma-radiation induced the activated T cells "immunogenic apoptosis" and exposed/secreted DAMPs (CRT, ERp57 and Vementin) played an important role in TCV therapy.
