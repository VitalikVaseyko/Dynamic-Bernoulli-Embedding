In order to provide information on the relative binding characteristics of glycolytic enzymes, the effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) on the release of glycolytic enzymes from cultured pig kidney cells treated with digitonin has been studied. In the absence of FBP, a differential release of these enzymes was observed, with the order of retention being aldolase greater than glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase greater than glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerokinase, phosphoglucomutase, lactate dehydrogenase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase. In the presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, the release of aldolase was considerably enhanced, whereas the release of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase was decreased by this metabolite. No significant alterations in the rate of release of the other enzymes was caused by FBP. These data have been discussed in relation to their contribution to the knowledge of the degree of association and order of binding between glycolytic enzymes and the cytoplasmic matrix.
