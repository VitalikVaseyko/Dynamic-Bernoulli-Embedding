Activity of several enzymes of the glycogen and carbohydrate metabolism is studied in HT 29 colon adenocarcinoma cell line and in HT 29 tumors developed in nude mice, by reference to the normal human colon mucosa. Activity of glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase is found to be increased in both the cultured cells and the tumors. It indicates that the biochemical strategy of malignant cells, due to the neoplastic transformation process, involves specific changes in the carbohydrate metabolism of tumor as well as in vitro growing correspondent cell line.
