A key enzyme of glycolysis (pyruvate kinase) and main enzymes of the electron transport system (NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinic cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were measured in left ventricular biopsy specimens from six hypertrophic (HCM) and six congestive (CCM) cardiomyopathy. Pyruvate kinase was 104.0 and 45.0 mU/mg protein in HCM and CCM, respectively. NADH cytochrome c reductase, succinic cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase were 146.0, 9.9, and 775.0 mU/mg protein in HCM and 87.4, 5.2, and 502.0 mU/mg protein in CCM, respectively. From these data, it is evident that glycolysis and enzyme activities of the electron transport system are increased in HCM and decreased in CCM. Cardiac function reflects the state of these energy metabolism pathways in the myocardium. The changing energy metabolism in the right ventricle of the emphysema hamster seems to support this concept.
