The ongoing accumulation of knowledge raises hopes that understanding tumor metabolism will provide new ways for predicting, diagnosing, and even treating cancers. Some metabolic biomarkers are at present routinely utilized to diagnose cancer and metabolic alterations of tumors are being confirmed as therapeutic targets. The growing utilization of metabolomics in clinical research may rapidly turn it into one of the most potent instruments used to detect and fight tumor. In fact, while the current state and trends of high throughput metabolomics profiling focus on the purpose of discovering biomarkers and hunting for metabolic mechanism, a prospective direction, namely reprogramming metabolomics, highlights the way to use metabolomics approach for the aim of treatment of disease by way of reconstruction of disturbed metabolic pathways. In this review, we present an ample summary of the current clinical appliances of metabolomics in hematological malignancies.
