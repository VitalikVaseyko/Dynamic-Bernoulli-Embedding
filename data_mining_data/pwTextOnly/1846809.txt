The dynamics of the fructose 6-phosphate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate cycle operating in an open and homogeneous system reconstituted from purified enzymes was extensively studied. In addition to 6-phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinae and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase were involved. In that multi-enzyme system, the main source of non-linearity is the reciprocal effect of AMP on the activities of 6-phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Depending upon the experimental parameter values, stable attractors, various types of multiple states and sustained oscillations were shown to occur. In the present report we show that irreversible transitions are also likely to occur for realistic operating conditions. Two parameters of the system, that is the adenylate energy charge of the influx and the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase maximal activity, are potential candidates to provoke such irreversible transitions from one steady state to the other: (a) when varying the maximal activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, the system can jump irreversibly from a low to a high stable steady state, and (b) when the adenylate energy charge of the influx is the changing parameter, irreversible transitions occur from a high stable steady state to a stable oscillatory state (limit cycle motion). This behavior can be predicted by constructing the loci of limit points and Hopf bifurcation points.
