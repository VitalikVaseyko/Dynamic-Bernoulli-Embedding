The in vitro effect of acrylamide and its analogues on rat brain glycolytic enzymes was examined to elucidate the biochemical lesions responsible for the pathogenesis of acrylamide-induced neuropathy. All test compounds inhibited glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, irrespective of their neurotoxicity, and their inhibitory potency was a linear function of the rate constant with reduced glutathione. Phosphofructokinase was also inhibited by some of the test compounds, independently of their neurotoxicity. The rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, were not inhibited by acrylamide.
