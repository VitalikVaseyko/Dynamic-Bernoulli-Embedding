Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) specific activity increased by 250% following 8 to 10 days of Pi starvation of Brassica napus suspension cells. Densitometric scanning of PEPC immunoblots revealed a close correlation between PEPC activity and the amount of the antigenic 104-kDa PEPC subunit. To further assess the influence of Pi deprivation on PEPC, the enzyme was purified from Pi-sufficient (+Pi) and Pi-starved (-Pi) cells to electrophoretic homogeneity and final specific activities of 37-40 micromol phosphoenolpyruvate utilized per min per mg protein. Gel filtration, SDS/PAGE, and CNBr peptide mapping indicated that the +Pi and -Pi PEPCs are both homotetramers composed of an identical 104-kDa subunit. Respective pH-activity profiles, phosphoenolpyruvate saturation kinetics, and sensitivity to L-malate inhibition were also indistinguishable. Kinetic studies and phosphatase treatments revealed that PEPC of the +Pi and -Pi cells exists mainly in its dephosphorylated (L-malate sensitive) form. Thus, up-regulation of PEPC activity in -Pi cells appears to be solely due to the accumulation of the same PEPC isoform being expressed in +Pi cells. PEPC activity was modulated by several metabolites involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. At pH 7.3, marked activation by glucose 6-phosphate and inhibition by L-malate, L-aspartate, L-glutamate, DL-isocitrate, rutin and quercetin was observed. The following paper provides a model for the coordinate regulation of B. napus PEPC and cytosolic pyruvate kinase by allosteric effectors. L-Aspartate and L-glutamate appear to play a crucial role in the control of the phosphoenolpyruvate branchpoint in B. napus, particularly with respect to the integration of carbohydrate partitioning with the generation of carbon skeletons required during nitrogen assimilation.
