The present study investigated the anti-obesity effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum) juices from the two Saudi Arabian, Taif red, Taif white, and Egyptian pomegranates in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats. Administrating any of the used juices decreased the body weight gain, food consumption, and serum levels of lipid, leptin, and glucose, while it increased serum insulin level. Histologically, all types of juices decreased the number and size of lipid droplets in hepatocytes compared to the obese, non-treated animals. All juices types upregulated the hepatic mRNA expression of hormone-sensitive lipase, pyruvate kinase, and adiponectin in obese rats; the genes were all suppressed by HFD feeding. Additionally, the expression of fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase1 was also upregulated by all types of juices. Conversely, ghrelin mRNA expression was downregulated by all used juices' types. These findings demonstrate that all types of tested juices protect against the HFD-induced obesity in rats.
