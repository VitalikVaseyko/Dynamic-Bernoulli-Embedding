The scanning electron microscope was used to study the surface morphologic features of erythrocytes from a Basenji dog with hereditary hemolytic anemia due to a pyruvate kinase-deficient erythrocytes (RBC). Cells from this dog were compared with RBC from normal dogs and from dogs with regenerative anemias unrelated to pyruvate kinase deficiency. Demonstration of spherical RBC with uniform spicules on their surface (spheroechinocytes) may provide a morphologic explanation for the shortened erythrocytic life-span previously reported in congenital hemolytic anemia of Basenji dogs. Spherical, spiculated RBC were not found in blood from normal dogs or from anemic dogs with reticulocytoses. The surface of reticulocytes from all dogs with regenerative anemia was roughened, with pronounced folding of the cell membrane.
