Gene expression of aldolase B, an important enzyme for glucose and fructose metabolism, is regulated by hormones. We examined direct effects of major hormones on aldolase B gene expression in rat primary cultured hepatocytes, in comparison with those on the gene expression of phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Insulin, dexamethasone, and high concentration of glucose increased aldolase B mRNA abundance in the hepatocytes. Glucagon strongly suppressed aldolase B gene expression, and this hormone canceled the stimulative effects of insulin, dexamethasone, and high concentration of glucose. Epinephrine and thyroxine slightly reduced aldolase B mRNA abundance, but these hormones did not cancel the stimulative effects of insulin and dexamethasone. To the contrary, expression of PEPCK gene was suppressed by insulin, dexamethasone, and high concentration of glucose, and remarkably induced by glucagon. Glucagon rapidly suppressed aldolase B gene expression at the transcriptional level. Forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP mimicked the suppressive effect of glucagon on aldolase B gene expression. These results suggest that glucagon may be a key regulator of aldolase B gene transcription through a cAMP/protein kinase A-signaling pathway.
