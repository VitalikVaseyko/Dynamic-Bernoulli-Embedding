Human erythrocytes overloaded with glucose 1,6-bisphosphate were prepared in order to establish the metabolic significance of this phosphorylated sugar in the intact red cell. The intracellular glucose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration was increased six- and twofold over the normal level by encapsulating (i) the commercially available compound and (ii) the glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthase obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle, respectively. In both experimental conditions, a reduction of glucose utilization by the loaded cells was observed after reequilibration to the steady state. At the steady state, the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates and of the adenine nucleotides appeared substantially unmodified when compared with those of controls, with the exception of a 50% reduction of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate measured in erythrocytes encapsulated with exogenous glucose 1,6-bisphosphate. Under the considered experimental conditions, the elevated intracellular glucose 1,6-bisphosphate appears to display an inhibitory effect on hexokinase that overcomes the possible activation of phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase.
