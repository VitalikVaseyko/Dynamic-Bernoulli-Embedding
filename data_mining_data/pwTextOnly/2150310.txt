In a continuing study of the interactions between glycolytic enzymes and cytoskeletal structure, the influence of a variation of the pH of the eluting medium has been investigated. This treatment resulted in an increased degree of binding of most of the glycolytic enzymes with a decrease in pH, with the most marked increases in binding occurring with phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, enolase and pyruvate kinase. The significance of this data has been discussed with reference to the relative affinities of interaction of the individual glycolytic components and the physiological correlations of these phenomena.
