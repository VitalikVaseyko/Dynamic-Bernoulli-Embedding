Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of protists that sequester the first six or seven glycolytic steps inside specialized peroxisomes, named glycosomes. Because of the glycosomal membrane impermeability to nucleotides, ATP molecules consumed by the first glycolytic steps need to be regenerated in the glycosomes by kinases, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The glycosomal pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which reversibly converts phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate, could also be involved in this process. To address this question, we analyzed the metabolism of the main carbon sources used by the procyclic trypanosomes (glucose, proline, and threonine) after deletion of the PPDK gene in the wild-type (Deltappdk) and PEPCK null (Deltappdk/Deltapepck) backgrounds. The rate of acetate production from glucose is 30% reduced in the Deltappdk mutant, whereas threonine-derived acetate production is not affected, showing that PPDK function in the glycolytic direction with production of ATP in the glycosomes. The Deltappdk/Deltapepck mutant incubated in glucose as the only carbon source showed a 3.8-fold reduction of the glycolytic rate compared with the Deltapepck mutant, as a consequence of the imbalanced glycosomal ATP/ADP ratio. The role of PPDK in maintenance of the ATP/ADP balance was confirmed by expressing the glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC) in the Deltappdk/Deltapepck cell line, which restored the glycolytic flux. We also observed that expression of PGKC is lethal for procyclic trypanosomes, as a consequence of ATP depletion, due to glycosomal relocation of cytosolic ATP production. This illustrates the key roles played by glycosomal and cytosolic kinases, including PPDK, to maintain the cellular ATP/ADP homeostasis.
