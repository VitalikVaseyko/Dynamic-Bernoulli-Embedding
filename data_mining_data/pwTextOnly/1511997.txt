Fifty-eight cases of hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency were collected from both laboratories that have performed the assay since 1972 and from attending physicians in the province of Quebec. Using the postal addresses of the probands, a prevalence map was constructed according to the administrative regions of the province of Quebec. The prevalence was found to be higher in eastern Quebec (1/81,838) than in western Quebec (1/139,086). Fifty probands were of French Canadian origin whereas the remaining 6 were recent immigrants.
