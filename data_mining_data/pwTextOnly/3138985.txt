The proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex in the active dephosphorylated form was decreased (compared with fed lean control mice) in heart muscle mitochondria after the induction of obesity with gold-thioglucose (by 54%) or starvation of lean mice for 48 h (by 81%). The effects of obesity to inactivate PDH complex were demonstrable 4 weeks after administration of gold-thioglucose, and occurred despite significant hyperinsulinaemia in obese animals. Phosphorylation and inactivation of PDH complex in mouse heart muscle in starvation was attributed to a stable increase (2.7-fold) in the activity of PDH kinase as measured in extracts of mitochondria mediated by increased specific activity of a protein activator of PDH kinase (KAP) [Denyer, Kerbey & Randle (1986) Biochem. J. 239, 347-354]. In obese mice no such increase in kinase activity was observed, and we conclude that phosphorylation and inactivation of PDH complex in heart muscle in obesity is not mediated by KAP, but rather is a consequence of increased lipid oxidation.
