Plasma pyruvate kinase (PK) and creatine kinase (CK) activities were increased significantly (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively) in homozygote halothane-reacting pigs (nn), compared with those activities in homozygote nonreacting pigs (NN). Pyruvate kinase activity was less variable within groups than was CK activity, allowing more effective discrimination between nn and NN geno-types. The PK and CK activities in plasma increase with age in halothane-reacting pigs and the nonreacting pigs. Enzyme activities in heterozygote (Nn) nonreacting pigs did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) from enzyme activities of homozygote (NN) nonreacting pigs. Although PK was better than CK in identifying stress-susceptible pigs, age-related effects and the failure to identify heterozygotes may restrict the use of plasma PK activity as a diagnostic test for the stress syndrome.
