Fatty acids (FAs) are acquired from free FA associated with albumin and lipoprotein triglyceride that is hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LpL). Hypertrophied hearts shift their substrate usage pattern to more glucose and less FA. However, FAs may still be an important source of energy in hypertrophied hearts. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of LpL-derived FAs in hypertensive hypertrophied hearts. We followed cardiac function and metabolic changes during 2 wk of angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertension in control and heart-specific lipoprotein lipase knockout (hLpL0) mice. Glucose metabolism was increased in ANG II-treated control (control/ANG II) hearts, raising it to the same level as hLpL0 hearts. FA uptake-related genes, CD36 and FATP1, were reduced in control/ANG II hearts to levels found in hLpL0 hearts. ANG II did not alter these metabolic genes in hLpL0 mice. LpL activity was preserved, and mitochondrial FA oxidation-related genes were not altered in control/ANG II hearts. In control/ANG II hearts, triglyceride stores were consumed and reached the same levels as in hLpL0/ANG II hearts. Intracellular ATP content was reduced only in hLpL0/ANG II hearts. Both ANG II and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt induced hypertension caused heart failure only in hLpL0 mice. Our data suggest that LpL activity is required for normal cardiac metabolic compensation to hypertensive stress.
