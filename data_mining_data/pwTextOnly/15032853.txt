Carbohydrate metabolism during the development of fruits of the tomato cultivar Micro-Tom was studied. The metabolism of the pericarp and placental tissues was found to be different. Starch was degraded more slowly in the placenta in comparison with the pericarp, whereas soluble sugars accumulated to a greater extent in the pericarp. The activities of glycolytic enzymes tended to peak at 40 days after flowering. Two of these, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphatase and pyruvate kinase, showed a dramatic increase in activity just before this peak, possibly indicating a role in up-regulating glycolysis to generate increased ATP that would be used during climacteric respiration. The expression of plastidial transporters was studied. Both the TPT and Glu6P transporter were expressed greatest in green fruits, before declining. The expression of the triose-phosphate transporter was greater than that of the glucose 6-phosphate transporter. The ATP/ADP transporter was expressed to a low level throughout fruit development.
