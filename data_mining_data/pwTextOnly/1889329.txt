The serum levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme (MB), lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and myoglobin were studied in 85 carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 125 normal female controls. The results showed that the best single test for carrier detection was myoglobin or creatine kinase, the combination of multiple tests could increase the effectiveness of carrier detection, in which the best and most rational tests to use in combination were creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and myoglobin.
