The effect of a ascent to moderate altitude (2,300 m) and altitude training on the O2-transport properties of Hb and their possible consequences on tissue oxygenation during exercise were studied on six control and six training subjects. A rapid increase in P-50 values (+2.4 mm Hg, 0.32 kPa) was measured within one day after ascent. At the end of the stay at altitude (13th day) P-50 values were higher in subjects performing training than in controls. At altitude a slow but constant increase in 2,3-DPG, pyruvate kinase activity and reticulocyte count was found, which was more pronounced in training subjects as compared to controls. Ascent to altitude resulted in a decreased maximal performance capacity (-9%), but both groups recovered during the stay. In training subjects maximal exercise performance was increased after descent. Exercise at altitude was performed at a lower heart rate (controls: -10/min; training: -18/min) and at a lower lactate concentration (-4 mmol/l). These data indicate a positive effect of adaptation to altitude on exercise performance. Training itself shifts the ODC to the right and adds this effect to the effects of passive altitude adaptation on the O2-binding properties of hemoglobin.
