An enzymatic method was proposed for measuring acetylpolyamine (AcPA) alone, even when non-acetylated polyamine co-exists. The method consisted of four enzymatic reactions. First, AcPA was hydrolysed by acylpolyamine amidohydrolase to yield acetate; followed by the other three reactions coupled with three enzymes, respectively, acetate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase; the acetate formation caused a decrease in NADH. The quantity of AcPA was then evaluated as the change in absorbance at 340 nm. The reagent composition of the reaction mixture was determined, and characteristics of the method were investigated. The validation tests produced satisfactory results. The co-existence of non-acetylated polyamine gave no effect on the measurement. The present method was found to be used easily, rapidly and reliably for the selective determination of AcPA itself.
