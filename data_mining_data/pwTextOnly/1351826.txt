1. Haematology, red cell metabolism and blood chemistry of five fledgeling black-faced cormorants Leucocarbo fuscescens were studied and the results were compared with previously reported data on several other sea-birds. 2. The mean erythrocyte count of the cormorant is similar to that of penguins but lower than that of flying, non-diving sea-birds. The cormorant's red cell mean cell volume (MCV) is lower than that of penguins but higher than that of non-diving sea-birds. 3. Leucocyte numbers are within expected limits for avian species. 4. Red cell enzymes: glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase and enolase are higher in the cormorant than in the little penguin; glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglyceromutase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase are lower. 5. Haemoglobin electrophoresis showed a typical avian haemoglobin pattern.
