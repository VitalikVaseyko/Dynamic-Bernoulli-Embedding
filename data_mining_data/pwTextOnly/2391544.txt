Changes in muscle proteins in serum after exercise were studied to evaluate the use of such proteins as indicators of increased muscle membrane vulnerability. Seventy-one women were asked to perform bicycle exercise for 45 min at a moderate load; four proteins (creatine kinase - CK, myoglobin - Mb, aldolase - Ald and pyruvate kinase - PK) were measured in serum up to 24 h after exercise. Twenty-one women were carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD); these are known to show an elevated serum CK activity at rest, as well as increased CK response after exercise. Fifty women without a family history of neuromuscular disease were tested to obtain normal values: they showed a small peak (18%) of CK activity 8 h after exercise, and an even smaller peak of Mb (9%) 1 h after exercise. The mean post-exercise increase for both CK and Mb in the 21 DMD carriers was significantly higher than in controls; the maximum of Mb, on average 70% of baseline levels, was reached 1 h after exercise and was higher than that for CK (48%), which was reached 8 h after exercise. It is concluded that myoglobin levels after exercise are a good index of increased vulnerability of the muscle membrane.
