The hepatocyte and haematopoietic cell contents of the liver of the foetal guinea pig were measured over the latter half of gestation. Hepatocytes represented about 30% of liver volume at mid-gestation and this increased to 70-80% by term; cell volume remained fairly constant until 5-7 days before term, then more than doubled. Haematopoietic cells represented about 5% of liver volume at mid-gestation and this progressively fell to <1% by term. At 75% of gestation hepatocytes and haematopoietic cells were prepared from perfused foetal livers by collagenase digestion. Enzyme activity of the hepatocyte was, without exception, similar to that of the whole liver. In general, enzyme activity in the haematopoietic cells was similar to that in erythrocytes, with relatively low values for aldolase, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, ;malic' enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase. The haematopoietic cell contribution to total enzyme activity in the foetal liver was usually much less than 10% and could thus not account for the major changes in hepatic enzyme activity over the latter half of gestation. Hepatocytes contained hexokinase isoenzymes I and III, aldolase isoenzymes A and B and pyruvate kinase isoenzymes 1, 2 and 4. The haematopoietic cells contained hexokinase isoenzyme I and two additional bands of activity with slightly greater mobility, aldolase isoenzyme A and pyruvate kinase isoenzymes 2 and 4.
