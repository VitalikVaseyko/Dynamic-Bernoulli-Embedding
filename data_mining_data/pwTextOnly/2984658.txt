A method for determining the enzymatic activity of hexokinases, acetate kinase and pyruvate kinase using an enzyme electrode was developed. The assay time is 2-3 min. The lower limit of the activity determining is 0,054 U/ml. The proposed method was applied to investigation of pyruvate kinase and acetate kinase reactivation under the action of mercaptoethanol.
