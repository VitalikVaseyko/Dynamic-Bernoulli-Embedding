It was known that with dietary and hormonal conditions the level of hepatic L pyruvate kinase (LPK) varied greatly. By immunochemical method we demonstrate in vitro insulinodependence of MPK in isolated hepatocytes. In hepatocytes of fasted Rats this effect was time and concentration dependent, but proinsulin was ineffective.
