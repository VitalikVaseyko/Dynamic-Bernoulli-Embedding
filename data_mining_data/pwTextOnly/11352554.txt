The possible effects of zinc in the modulation of the activity of glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase through tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction in isolated digestive gland cells from mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) were investigated. Addition of micromolar concentrations of zinc resulted in both time- and concentration-dependent stimulation of glycolytic enzyme activities similar to those previously observed with insulin; however, zinc pretreatment prevented the glycolytic effect of insulin in mussel cells. The insulin-like effect of zinc was mediated by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, as demonstrated by Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. The pattern of zinc-induced phosphorylation resembled that induced by insulin. Moreover, both zinc and insulin induced activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs); however, whereas zinc gave a clear effect on the stress-activated p-38 MAPK, insulin activated extracellular-activated MAPK (ERK2) and inhibited p-38. The results demonstrate that zinc can act as a physiological regulator of tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling in mussel digestive gland cells, in particular at the level of MAPK activation. Activation of p-38 by zinc may be a key step in prevention of the glycolytic effect of insulin in mussel cells. These data underline the importance of cross talk between different MAPKs in determination of the response to extracellular stimuli in marine invertebrate cells.
