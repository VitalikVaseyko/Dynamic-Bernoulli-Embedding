Previous work demonstrated that acetate production was substantially lower in pyruvate kinase (pyk) mutant of Bacillus subtilis. The significantly lower acetate production in the pyk mutant is hypothesized to have positive effect on recombinant protein production either by lifting the inhibitory effect of acetate accumulation in the medium or redirecting the metabolic fluxes beneficial to biomass/protein synthesis. In this study, the impact of the pyk mutation on recombinant protein production was investigated. Green fluorescent protein (GFP+) was selected as a model protein and constitutively expressed in both the wild-type strain and a pyk mutant. In batch cultures, the pyk mutant produced 3-fold higher levels of recombinant protein when grown on glucose as carbon source. Experimental measurements and theoretical analysis show that the higher protein yield of the mutant is not due to removal of an acetate-associated inhibition of expression or gene dosage or protein stability but a much lower acetate production in the mutant allows for a greater fraction of carbon intake to be directed to protein synthesis.
