Succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) play key roles in the regulation of growth and survival of various cancers. This study aimed to investigate expression of SDHB and PDK1 in recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) tissues and analyzed the association of SDHB and PDK1 expression with the clinical significance and potential prognostic implication of rNPC. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of SDHB and PDK1 in tissues in primary NPC (pNPC) and rNPC patients. Our results revealed that expression of SDHB in rNPC was significantly lower than that in pNPC, while the expression of PDK1 was higher compared to pNPC. The expression levels of SDHB and PDK1 were associated with T stage, N stage, clinical stage, and metastasis of rNPC. Survival analysis showed that patients with low SDHB expression had a significantly shorter overall survival time than those with high SDHB expression. Patients with high PDK1 expression had a shorter survival time than patients with low PDK1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that the expression of SDHB and PDK1 was an independent predictor for the survival of patients with rNPC. Our results demonstrated that down-regulation of SDHB and up-regulation of PDK1 may be novel biomarkers for predicting advanced tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis in rNPC patients.
