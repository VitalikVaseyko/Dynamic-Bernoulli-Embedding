The specific activities of LDH, MDH and ALD of bovine aqueous humour show no significant changes in dependence on age. The protein content remains constant too. Determination of the enzyme activities of Sorbitoldehydrogenase and Pyruvatekinase was not successful due to disturbing activities of the crude aqueous. Substrate affinities (KM-value) of LDH, MDH and ALD are almost identical in aqueous, serum and lens of the bovine.
