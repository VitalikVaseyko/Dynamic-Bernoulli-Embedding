A mathematical model for circadian self-oscillation in the carbohydrate branch of energy metabolism (CEM) was analysed. The self-oscillations are due to the reciprocal regulation of the activities of 6-phosphofructokinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The circadian period was shown to be insensitive to metabolic disturbances because of the presence in CEM of negative feedback mechanisms regulating the activities of the key enzymes 6-phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. It has been also shown that such mechanisms are largely synergistic in their action.
