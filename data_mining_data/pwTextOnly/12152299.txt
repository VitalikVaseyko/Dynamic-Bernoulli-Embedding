The levels of glycogen, glucose, lactate, as well the activities of ten enzymes of carbohydrates metabolism in brain, liver and white muscle of sea scorpion have been investigated. Metabolite concentrations didn't change in brain and the levels of glycogen and lactate were constant in the rest tissues investigated. Glucose concentration decreased in the liver and increased in muscle. In brain hypoxia decreased the activity of hexokinase and increased one of pyruvate kinase, phosphoglucoisomerase and fructoso-1,6-bisphosphatase. In liver most of the enzymes showed the tendency to decrease of their activities. In muscle the activities of phosphofructokinase and phosphoglucoisomerase decreased. Mechanisms of carbohydrates metabolism regulation under hypoxia are discussed.
