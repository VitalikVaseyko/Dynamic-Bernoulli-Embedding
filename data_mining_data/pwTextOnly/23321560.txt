Hitherto unknown protective effect of N,alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl vincosamide (VR), isolated from Moringa oleifera leaves in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac toxicity was evaluated in rats. Oral administration of VR at 40 mg/kg for 7 days markedly reduced the ISO-induced increase in the levels of serum cardiac markers such as troponin-T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase as well as cardiac lipid peroxidation with a parallel increase in the cellular antioxidants suggesting its cardio-protective and free radical scavenging potential, which was latter confirmed by in vitro study. Rats treated with test compound also improved the ISO-induced abnormal changes in ECG as well as in cardiac histology. A reduction in myocardial necrosis was further evidenced by the tri-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain in isolated test drug pretreated rats. These findings suggest the cardio-protective potential of the isolated alkaloid and possibly the beneficial action is mediated through its free radical scavenging property.
