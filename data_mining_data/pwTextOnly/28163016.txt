Non-enzymatic protein modification driven by thioester reactivity is thought to play a major role in the establishment of cellular lysine acylation. However, the specific protein targets of this process are largely unknown. Here we report an experimental strategy to investigate non-enzymatic acylation in cells. Specifically, we develop a chemoproteomic method that separates thioester reactivity from enzymatic utilization, allowing selective enrichment of non-enzymatic acylation targets. Applying this method to cancer cell lines identifies numerous candidate targets of non-enzymatic acylation, including several enzymes in lower glycolysis. Functional studies highlight malonyl-CoA as a reactive thioester metabolite that can modify and inhibit glycolytic enzyme activity. Finally, we show that synthetic thioesters can be used as novel reagents to probe non-enzymatic acylation in living cells. Our studies provide new insights into the targets and drivers of non-enzymatic acylation, and demonstrate the utility of reactivity-based methods to experimentally investigate this phenomenon in biology and disease.
