A cDNA clone encoding pyruvate kinase (PK) was isolated from a skeletal muscle cDNA library of globefish (Fugu rubripes), which is a kind of lower vertebrate. The full-length cDNA of globefish skeletal muscle pyruvate kinase (FM-PK) is approximately 2 kb and encodes a protein comprising 530 amino acids. The FM-PK gene is spanning approximately 4.8 kb and consists of 11 exons. FM-PK mRNA was detected in muscle and heart using Northern blots. The recombinant FM-PK (rFM-PK) was expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system and purified using ion-exchange chromatography. The purified rFM-PK was shown to exist a 230 kDa homotetramer composed of 57 kDa subunits. Gel filtration showed 230000 as the tetramer of the subunit. The apparent K(m) (or S(0.5)) and the Hill coefficient for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP are 0.14 mM, 1.3 and 0.30 mM 0.98 at pH 7.4, respectively, when the enzyme is saturated with the second substrate. The rFM-PK is strongly activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, the apparent K(m) for PEP changes to 0.059 mM and the Hill coefficient to 1.1. ATP, which is the product of the enzyme reaction, inhibits activity. This is the first report to show the full-length cDNA and amino acid sequence of PK for a species of fish.
