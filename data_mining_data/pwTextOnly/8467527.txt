Yeast cells defective in the GGS1 (FDP1/BYP1) gene are unable to adapt to fermentative metabolism. When glucose is added to derepressed ggs1 cells, growth is arrested due to an overloading of glycolysis with sugar phosphates which eventually leads to a depletion of phosphate in the cytosol. Ggs1 mutants lack all glucose-induced regulatory effects investigated so far. We reduced hexokinase activity in ggs1 strains by deleting the gene HXK2 encoding hexokinase PII. The double mutant ggs1 delta, hxk2 delta grew on glucose. This is in agreement with the idea that an inability of the ggs1 mutants to regulate the initiation of glycolysis causes the growth deficiency. However, the ggs1 delta, hxk2 delta double mutant still displayed a high level of glucose-6-phosphate as well as the rapid appearance of free intracellular glucose. This is consistent with our previous model suggesting an involvement of GGS1 in transport-associated sugar phosphorylation. Glucose induction of pyruvate decarboxylase, glucose-induced cAMP-signalling, glucose-induced inactivation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose-induced activation of the potassium transport system, all deficient in ggs1 mutants, were restored by the deletion of HXK2. However, both the ggs1 delta and the ggs1 delta, hk2 delta mutant lack detectable trehalose and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase activity. Trehalose is undetectable even in ggs1 delta strains with strongly reduced activity of protein kinase A which normally causes a very high trehalose content. These data fit with the recent cloning of GGS1 as a subunit of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
