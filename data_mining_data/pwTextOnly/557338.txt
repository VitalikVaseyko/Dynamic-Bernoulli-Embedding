The formation of multiple ligand complexes with muscle pyruvate kinase was measured in terms of dissociation constants and the standard free energies of formation were calculated. The binding of Mn2+ to the enzyme (KA = 55 +/- 5 X 10(-6) M; deltaF degrees = -5.75 +/- 0.05 kcal/mol) and to the enzyme saturated with phosphoenolpyruvate (conditional free energy) KA' = 0.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(-6) M; deltaF degrees = -8.22 +/- 0.34 kcal/mol) has been measured under identical conditions giving a free energy of coupling, delta(deltaF degrees) = -2.47 +/- 0.34 kcal/mol. Such a large negative free energy of coupling is diagnostic of a strong positively cooperative effect in ligand binding. The binding of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate to free enzyme and the enzyme-Mn2+ complex was, by necessity, measured by different methods. The free energy of phosphoenolpyruvate binding to free enzyme (KS = 1.58 +/- 0.10 X 10(-4)M; deltaF degrees = -5.13 +/- 0.04 kcal/mol) and to the enzyme-Mn2+ complex (K3 = 0.75 +/- 0.10 X 10(-6)M; deltaF degrees = -8.26 +/- 0.07 kcal/mol) also gives a large negative free energy of coupling, delta(deltaF degrees) = -3.16 +/- 0.08 kcal/mol. Such a large negative value confirms reciprocal binding effects between the divalent cation and the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. The binding of Mn2+ to the enzyme-ADP complex was also investigated and a free energy of coupling, delta(deltaF degrees) = -0.08 +/- 0.08 kcal/mol, was measured, indicative of little or no cooperativity in binding. The free energy of coupling with Mn2+ and pyruvate was measured as -1.52 +/- 0.14 kcal/mol, showing a significant amount of cooperativity in ligand binding but a substantially smaller effect than that observed for phosphoenolpyruvate binding. The magnitude of the coupling free energy may be related to the role of the divalent cation in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complexes. In the absence of the activating monovalent cation, the coupling free energies for phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate binding decrease by 40-60% and 25%, respectively, substantiating a role for the monovalent cation in the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes with phosphoenolpyruvate and with pyruvate.
