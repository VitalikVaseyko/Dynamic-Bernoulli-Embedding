Alloxan diabetes and injections of hydrocortisone into intact animals for 5-7 days resulted in a sharp decrease of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase in rat epididymal adipose tissue. Combined injection of insulin and hydrocortisone did not produce the decrease of the enzyme activity. Insulin injections into alloxan diabetic rats recovered the activity of NADP-malate dehydrogenase up to the control. Pyruvate kinase activity was decreased under diabetes, and insulin injections produced further decrease of the enzyme activity in diabetic rats. Activities of lactate dehydrogenase and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase were less decreased under diabetes. Comparison of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes spectrum in adipose tissue of normal and diabetic rats revealed a considerable increase of LDH-1 and a decrease of LDH-4 under diabetes. Insulin injections greatly normalized LDH isoenzyme spectrum.
