Pyruvate kinase of sea bass liver show a joint modulation of both pH and temperature for PEP substrate. The effect of F-1,6-P2, alanine and ATP is not fundamentally affected by a variation in pH. The kinetic constants in the presence of ATP are not affected, but the intensity of its inhibitor effect varies with temperature. A study of different buffers: Tris-HC1, Tris-maleic and phosphate, on this enzymatic activity with or without effectors has been made.
