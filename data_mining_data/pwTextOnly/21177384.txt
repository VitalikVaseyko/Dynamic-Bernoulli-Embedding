We hypothesized that dysregulation of lactate/pyruvate (monocarboxylate) transporters (MCT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoforms contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer. Therefore, we assayed for the expression levels and the localizations of MCT (1, 2, and 4), and LDH (A and B) isoforms in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and compared results with those from a control, untransformed primary breast cell line, HMEC 184. Remarkably, MCT1 is not expressed in MDA-MB-231, but MCT1 is expressed in MCF-7 cells, where its abundance is less than in control HMEC 184 cells. When present in HMEC 184 and MCF-7 cells, MCT1 is localized to the plasma membrane. MCT2 and MCT4 were expressed in all the cell lines studied. MCT4 expression was higher in MDA-MB-231 compared with MCF-7 and HMEC 184 cells, whereas MCT2 abundance was higher in MCF-7 compared with MDA-MB-231 and HMEC 184 cells. Unlike MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 were localized in mitochondria in addition to the plasma membrane. LDHA and LDHB were expressed in all the cell-lines, but abundances were higher in the two cancer cell lines than in the control cells. MCF-7 cells expressed mainly LDHB, while MDA-MB-231 and control cells expressed mainly LDHA. LDH isoforms were localized in mitochondria in addition to the cytosol. These localization patterns were the same in cancerous and control cell lines. In conclusion, MCT and LDH isoforms have distinct expression patterns in two breast cancer cell lines. These differences may contribute to divergent lactate dynamics and oxidative capacities in these cells, and offer possibilities for targeting cancer cells.
