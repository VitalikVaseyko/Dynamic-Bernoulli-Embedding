The effect of treatment of rats with bacterial endotoxin on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) metabolism was investigated in isolated liver cells prepared from 18 h-starved animals. The results obtained support the hypothesis that a stimulation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) activity and an inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P2ase) may be one mechanism underlying the inhibition of gluconeogenesis from lactate and pyruvate by endotoxin. We suggest that the stimulation of PFK-1 and inhibition of Fru-1,6-P2ase activity is the result of a 2-3-fold increase in Fru-2,6-P2. The latter is not due to changes in the total activity or phosphorylation state of the bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, but appears to be the result of a decrease in the cytosolic concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), an inhibitor of PFK-2 activity. The effect of endotoxin is resistant to the presence of glucagon, which has comparable effects in cells prepared from both control and endotoxin-treated animals. The mechanism by which endotoxin treatment of the rat decreases PEP and gluconeogenesis remains to be established. However, it does not involve alterations in either the total activity or the phosphorylation state of pyruvate kinase, nor does it involve increased flux through this enzyme in the intact cell, which is in fact decreased in this model of septic shock. It is suggested that the decreased flux may result from a lower rate of formation of PEP, suggesting that the prime lesion in sepsis is an inhibition of one or more of the steps leading to PEP formation.
