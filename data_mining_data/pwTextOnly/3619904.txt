A gel electrophoretic technique was used to demonstrate an interaction with the soluble enzymes aldolase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and muscle type lactate dehydrogenase to the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. It is suggested that tubulin, like actin, is a key cytoskeletal structure with which soluble proteins may associate.
