This article has been retracted by the authors as it was discovered that duplication of several key experiments described herein were not possible because: The difference between acidification of culture medium in si-Ctrl group and si-ACLY could not be observed and the results of lactate production and glucose consumption could not be repeated. The authors regret any confusion caused.
