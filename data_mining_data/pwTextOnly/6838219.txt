Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate by ATP. The product (3-nitro-2-phosphopropionate) decomposes nonenzymatically and inactivates the enzyme. The inactivation process is irreversible and the enzyme is completely protected against inactivation by mercaptoethanol or the competitive inhibitor oxalate. The Km for 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate (DL) is 40 mM and kcat = 5 s-1 at pH 8.6. In terms of kcat/km, 3-nitro-2-hydroxypropionate is a fourfold better substrate than glycolate.
