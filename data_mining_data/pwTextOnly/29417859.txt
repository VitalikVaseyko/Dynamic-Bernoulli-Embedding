Hemoglobinopathies are a group of inherited single gene disorders. There are reports on hemoglobin (Hb) variants identified in the tribal and non-tribal populations of Tripura State in northeastern India. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of hemoglobinopathies and enzymopathies by newborn screening in Tripura State and assess the extent of neonatal jaundice. A total of 2400 cord blood samples were collected and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Further confirmation of any abnormal HPLC was done by DNA analysis. The samples were also screened for deficiency of enzymopathies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and pyruvate kinase. Of 2400 cord blood samples screened, 225 (9.3%) were Hb E (HBB: c.79G>A) heterozygotes, 80 (3.3%) were Hb E homozygotes and one carried Hb E-beta-thalassemia (beta-thal). Other Hb abnormalities were also detected including 15 Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) heterozygotes, two Hb D-Punjab (HBB: c.364G>C) heterozygotes and two compound heterozygotes for Hb D-Punjab and Hb E. Of the 80 homozygous Hb E babies, four were non-tribal and 76 babies were tribal, and 225 patients carried Hb E trait, 141 were tribal, while 84 were non-tribal. Of 40 G6PD deficient babies identified, 13 had coinherited Hb E and two babies had pyruvate kinase deficiency. alpha Genotyping was performed in 162 affected babies, 50 of them carried alpha gene deletions. Newborn screening programs for Hb E, other hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency must be encouraged in the malaria-endemic northeastern region of India. Drug-induced hemolysis can also be avoided by screening for G6PD deficiency at birth.
