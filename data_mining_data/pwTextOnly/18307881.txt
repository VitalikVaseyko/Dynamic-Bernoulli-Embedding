OBJECTIVE: To characterize the biologic featrues of hepatic oval cells and their protein expression profiles during induced differentiation in vitro. METHODS: Rat hepatic oval cells were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vitro, followed by morphological and molecular marker assessment by electromicroscopy, immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and protein expression chip technology. RESULTS: Ten weeks after induction, the levels of GST-P mRNA and M2-PK mRNA were significantly reduced, whereas those of ALB and CK18 were elevated. Significant variations of expression was seen in 8 protein species during the course of the induced differentiation. CONCLUSION: Combined EGF and HGF treatment in vitro induces cell differentiation of hepatic oval cells, a process in which 8 protein species may play some regulatory roles.
