L-type pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) purified from pig liver was ADP-ribosylated by incubation with NAD and ADP-ribosyltransferase purified from hen liver nuclei. Maximal incorporation of the ADP-ribose moiety from NAD into the L-type pyruvate kinase was 0.98 mol/mol of subunit. The Km values for NAD and L-type pyruvate kinase were 0.17 mM and 9.7 microM, respectively. ADP-ribosylation of the L-type pyruvate kinase resulted in suppression of the subsequent phosphorylation catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The ADP-ribosylation-induced suppression of phosphorylation of the L-type pyruvate kinase also resulted in suppression of the phosphorylation-induced inactivation. Amino acid analysis, after exhaustive sequential digestion of ADP-ribosyl-L-type pyruvate kinase with pepsin, aminopeptidase M and carboxy-peptidase B showed arginine to be the ADP-ribose-accepting amino acid. These results together with finding of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in mammalian liver cytosol (Moss, J. and Stanley, S.J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7830-7833) suggest that ADP-ribosylation may participate in the regulation of the L-type pyruvate kinase activity through changes in the rate of phosphorylation.
