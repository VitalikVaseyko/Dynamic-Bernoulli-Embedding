Glucagon effectively prevented the increase in glucose-6-phosphate dehodrogenase activity of rat liver following the administration of a glucose-casein mixture without altering the amount of the diet consumed. However, the increase of the enzyme level in carbon tetrachloride-injured rat liver was virtually insensitive to glucagon. The results obtained gave further evidence for the difference between these two induction mechanisms of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
