Molecular aspects of the insulin action in an organism are discussed. The following mechanisms of the hormone effect are considered: induction of the synthesis of glycolytic enzymes in cell-targets under effect of insulin; mechanisms of the insulin reception in cell-enzymes in cell-targets; the possible role of cyclic nucleotides as mediators in the effect of insulin in cell targets.
