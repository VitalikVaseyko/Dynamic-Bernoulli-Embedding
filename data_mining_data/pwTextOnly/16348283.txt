Lactobacillus plantarum catabolic end products changed in response to environmental conditions. While lactate was always the major end product, acetate was produced in alkaline and aerobic environments. Acetoin levels decreased under alkaline conditions. Changes in acetoin dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, NADH oxidase, pyruvate oxidase, and acetate kinase activities correlated with changes in end product distribution.
