Syntheny and localization of the following genes in common shrew Sorex araneus were determined: isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), acid phosphatase 2 (ACP2), glutamine--pyruvate--oxo-acid transaminase (GPT), and inorganic pyrophosphatase (PP) on chromosome ik; adenylate kinases 1 and 3 (AK1 and AK3) on chromosome af; and enolase 1 (ENO1) on chromosome jl. Two genes were assigned to definite arms: aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) to arm p of chromosome mp and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) to arm q of chromosome qr. Thus, 26 genes marking eight out of ten chromosomes are present now on the cytogenetic map of common shrew. These include previously described localizations.
