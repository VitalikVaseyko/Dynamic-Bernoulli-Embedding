As a hallmark of cancer, the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) confers a selective advantage for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Due to frequent aberration of upstream proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors, hyperactive mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a potent inducer of the Warburg effect. Here, we report that overexpression of a glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglyceric acid mutase-1 (PGAM1), is critical to oncogenic mTOR-mediated Warburg effect. mTOR stimulated PGAM1 expression through hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha-mediated transcriptional activation. Blockage of PGAM1 suppressed mTOR-dependent glycolysis, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. PGAM1 expression and mTOR activity were positively correlated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and PGAM1 abundance was an adverse predictor for patient survival. PGAM1 is thus a downstream effector of mTOR signaling pathway and mTOR-PGAM1 signaling cascade may contribute to the development of Warburg effect observed in cancer. We consider PGAM1 as a novel prognostic biomarker for NSCLC and a therapeutic target for cancer.
