The initial velocity of the reaction catalysed by rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase was studied as a function of the concentrations of the modifiers phenylalanine and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate under conditions where the relationships between the initial velocities and the concentrations of substrates are non-hyperbolic. It is shown that these data can be represented by the exponential model for a regulatory enzyme.
