The mixed anhydride of oxalic and phosphoric acids, oxalyl phosphate, has been prepared by reaction of oxalyl chloride and inorganic phosphate in aqueous solution. The product was purified by anion exchange chromatography and characterized by 31P and 13C NMR. This acyl phosphate has a half-life of 51 h at pH 5.0 and 4 degrees C. Oxalyl phosphate, an analogue of phosphoenolpyruvate, is a slow substrate for pyruvate kinase, undergoing an enzyme-dependent phosphotransfer reaction to produce ATP from ADP. Oxalyl phosphate substitutes for phosphoenolpyruvate in the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate, phosphate dikinase. The acyl phosphate reacts with the free enzyme to give the phosphorylated form of the enzyme. Removal of the potent product inhibitor, oxalate, from the reaction mixtures by gel filtration chromatography permitted further reaction of the phosphorylated enzyme with pyrophosphate and AMP to give ATP and Pi in a single turnover assay. Oxalyl phosphate also served as a phospho group donor in a partial reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase wherein GDP is phosphorylated at the expense of oxalyl phosphate.
