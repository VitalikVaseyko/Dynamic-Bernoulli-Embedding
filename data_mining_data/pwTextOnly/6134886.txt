A thirteen-year-old boy with congenital haemolytic anaemia due to pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency had an aplastic crisis. A serum parvovirus-like virus (SPLV) was demonstrated in the blood by electron microscopy and, subsequently, IgM and IgG antibodies to the prototype SPLV B19 were detected. In an attempt to define the level of erythropoiesis that is involved in parvovirus-induced bone marrow suppression, the levels of circulating early erythroid progenitors (burst forming units erythroid, BFU-E) were monitored during the crisis and recovery period. The virus-containing plasma inhibited the formation of BFU-Es from non-immune subjects and this effect was neutralised by convalescent serum. Colony forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) were also inhibited but this was probably non-specific since neutralisation did not reverse the effect. These experiments, together with the clinical data, suggest a selective effect of SPLV at the stage of erythroid progenitors.
