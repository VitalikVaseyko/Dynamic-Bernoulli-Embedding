Both histone-acetylations and histone deacetylases have been shown to play a key role in cardiac remodeling. Recently, it has become abundantly clear that many non-histone proteins are modified by post-translational lysine acetylations and that these acetylations regulate protein activity, conformation, and binding. In the present study, non-histone acetylated proteins associated with heart failure were identified. Global screening for lysine acetylated proteins was performed using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with immunoblotting with a primary monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Lysine acetylated proteins were compared in two rodent models of hypertensive heart failure, the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure prone (SHHF) rats with those in corresponding controls, i.e., the Dahl salt-resistant (SR) and W (W) rat strains, respectively. Forty-one and 66 acetylated proteins were detected in SS and SHHF failing hearts, respectively, but either not detected or detected with less abundance in corresponding control hearts. Twelve of these acetylated proteins were common to both models of heart failure. These were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry followed by Mascot Analysis and included mitochondrial enzymes: ATP synthase, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, malate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase. The abundance of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (Sirt3), a mitochondrial deacetylase was reduced in SS and SHHF failing hearts. This is the first description of non-histone protein acetylations associated with heart failure and raises the prospect that acetylations of mitochondrial proteins linked to reduced Sirt3 mediate, in part, metabolic changes in heart failure.
