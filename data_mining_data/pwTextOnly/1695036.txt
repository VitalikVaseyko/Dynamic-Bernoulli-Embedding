Results of staining section of rat liver using colloidal gold-labeled pyruvate kinase are described. On light microscopic level, centrolobular localized hepatocytes displayed the most intense specific staining. With electron microscopic observations, phosphoenolpyruvate residues were seen over granular zones in the nuclei, over the cisternae of the granular ER, mitochondria, and hepatocyte microvilli.
