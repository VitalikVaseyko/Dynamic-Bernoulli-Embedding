It was reported that mast cell degranulation is inversely related to the enzymatic activity of M(2)-type pyruvate kinase (M(2)PK). This study shows that activation of high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) evokes a sequential dual regulation of M(2)PK, i.e., an immediate decrement followed by slow phase increment of enzymatic activities. Changes in the activities of M(2)PK and mast cell degranulation showed similar time course after antigenic stimulation of FcepsilonRI. The immediate inhibition of M(2)PK involved tyrosine phosphorylation, and subsequently led to a cellular accumulation of glycolytic intermediates, including fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP), a feedforward activator of M(2)PK. As the cellular levels of FBP were increased, both the enzymatic acitivity of M(2)PK and mast cell degranulation slowly returned to near basal levels. A-Raf, when exogenously introduced into RBL-2H3 cells, phosphorylated M(2)PK on the serine residues, elevated enzyme activities of M(2)PK, and resulted in the inhibition of degranulation. These results suggest that dual regulation of M(2)PK which involves the phosphorylation of M(2)PK and accumulation of a feedforward activator of M(2)PK plays important roles in the control of mast cell degranulation.
