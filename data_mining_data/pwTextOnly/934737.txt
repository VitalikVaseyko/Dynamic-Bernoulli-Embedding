The activities of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase and ALA dehydratase in cord blood erythrocytes of newborn infants and peripheral blood red cells of patients with beta-thalassemia major, beta-thalassemia intermedia, hemoglobin Koln (Hb Koln) disease, sickle cell anemia, and pyruvate kinase deficiency were studied. The activity of ALA dehydratase did not vary appreciably with the number of immature RBC (reticulocytes and nucleated red blood cells) or the severity of the hemolytic anemia except in pyruvate kinase deficiency. The activity of ALA synthetase was linearly correlated with the number of immature RBC (r=0.974, p is less than 0.001). The ALA synthetase activity was significantly decreased in the RBC of Hb Koln (p is less than 0.01) when compared with the activity in immature RBC of newborns and of patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia intermedia.
