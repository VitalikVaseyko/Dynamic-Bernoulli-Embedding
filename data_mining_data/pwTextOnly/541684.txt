Purified pyruvate kinase was prepared from pooled brains obtained from untreated rats. Its properties suggest that it is similar to type 'M' pyruvate kinase. Lithium inhibition was demonstrated at pharmacologically significant lithium concentrations (7%-12% at 2 mmol 1-1 Li) and this was similar in character to that previously seen in rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, namely noncompetitive with respect to phosphoenol pyruvate, K+, and Mg2+ but competitive with ADP.
