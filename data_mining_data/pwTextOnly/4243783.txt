The effects of dimethyl sulphoxide and glycerol on ox brain microsomal Na(+)+K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3), K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and K(+)-dependent muscle pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) were studied. Dimethyl sulphoxide at concentrations below 20% (v/v) was found to stimulate the p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and pyruvate kinase by increasing their affinity for K(+) but to inhibit the Na(+)+K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. The latter enzyme activity was also inhibited by glycerol, which like dimethyl sulphoxide, stimulated the K(+)-activated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase at a wide range of concentrations. The solvent effects were promptly reversed by dilution. Similarity was found between glycerol and dimethyl sulphoxide, on one hand, and ATP, on the other, in their stimulatory effect and their ability to increase the ouabain- and oligomycin-sensitivity of the K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase. However, only the solvents, not the ATP, increased the binding of K(+) by the microsomes. From the above findings it is suggested that solvents may act on K(+)-dependent enzymes by altering the state of solvation of the activating cation as well as by changing the enzyme structure.
