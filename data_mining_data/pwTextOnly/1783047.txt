In cultured epithelial cells of rat liver the isoenzyme patterns of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase were studied and compared with those of freshly isolated parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells. In all epithelial cell lines pyruvate kinase was not activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, suggesting the absence of the L-isoenzyme. Cell lines derived from livers of newborn rats expressed LDH-4 and -5, whereas cell lines developed from fetal rat livers contained all 5 lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. In the latter case the pattern was found to depend on the state of confluence. All cell lines exhibited only a single alkaline phosphatase form, however, differences were found with respect to electrophoretic mobility.
