1. The activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malic enzyme, NAD+ and NADP+ isocitrate isocitrate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase were assayed in homogenate of camel hump and sheep tail tissues. 2. In addition the levels of glucose, cholesterol, total protein and total lipids in these tissues were measured. 3. Results obtained were utilized to compare the state of metabolism of adipose tissue of camel hump to that of sheep tail, and to shed some light on possible contribution of these tissues toward blood glucose level.
