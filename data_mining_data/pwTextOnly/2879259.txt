Carrier detection in Duchenne dystrophy (DD) and Becker dystrophy (BD) can be achieved with DNA probes that recognize restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). In 22 families, we found that 16 of 23 females at risk for being DD or BD carriers could be provided with more definitive indications of carrier status beyond the use of creatine kinase/pyruvate kinase and pedigree analysis. RFLP analysis was not possible for six individuals despite potentially informative probes, because family members critical to the analysis were unavailable. In only one instance were all eight probes uninformative.
