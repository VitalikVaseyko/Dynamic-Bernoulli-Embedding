The regulation of oxidative phosphorylation was studied with digitonin-treated epididymal bull spermatozoa in which mitochondria are directly accessible to low molecular compounds in the extracellular medium. Due to the high extramitochondrial ATPase activity in this cell preparation, it was possible to stimulate respiration to a small extent only by added hexokinase in the presence of glucose and adenine nucleotides. Added pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenol pyruvate, however, strongly suppressed the respiration. Under these conditions, the respiration was found to depend on the extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in the range of 1-100. The contribution of the adenine nucleotide translocator to this dependence was determined by titration with the irreversible inhibitor carboxyatractyloside in the presence of ADP. Using lactate plus malate as substrate, the active state respiration was controlled to about 30% by the translocator, whereas 12 and 4% were determined in the presence of L-glycerol-3-phosphate and malate alone, respectively. In order to compare the results with those for intact cells, the adenine nucleotide patterns were determined in intact and digitonin-treated spermatozoa under conditions of controlled respiration in the presence of vanadate and carboxyatractyloside, respectively. About 21% of total cellular adenine nucleotides were found in digitonin-treated cells representing the mitochondrial compartment. While allowing for the intramitochondrial amount of adenine nucleotides, the cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] ratio was estimated to be 6-times higher than the mitochondrial ratio in intact cells. It is concluded from the data presented that the principal mechanism by which oxidative phosphorylation in sperm mitochondria is regulated via the extramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio is the same as that demonstrated for other isolated mitochondria.
