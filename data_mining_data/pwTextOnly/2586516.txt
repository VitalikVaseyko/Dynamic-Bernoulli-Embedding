A DNA fragment spanning nucleotides -183 to -4 with respect to the cap site of the rat L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene contains at least four binding sites for putative transcriptional factors: hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), liver factor A1 (LF-A1), nuclear factor 1 (NF1), and major late transcription factor (MLTF). This fragment was used to direct transcription of a reporter sequence (a G-free cassette) in cell extracts. This L-PK promoter was active in liver nuclear extracts, but not in extracts from nonhepatic tissues. A reduction of 50% of the activity was obtained with a deleted L-PK promoter containing only the HNF1-binding site. In contrast, deletion of the HNF1-binding site inactivated the promoter by more than 90%. These results were confirmed by titration experiments with synthetic oligonucleotides. Titration of HNF1 resulted in an 85% decrease of transcriptional activity, while titration of LF-A1 resulted in only a 40% decrease. The influence of NF1 and MLTF seemed to be marginal in this system. The proximal 5'-flanking sequence of the L-PK gene therefore appears to function in vitro as an efficient liver-specific promoter which requires the binding of the liver factor HNF1 and which is also stimulated by the binding of another liver-specific factor, LF-A1.
