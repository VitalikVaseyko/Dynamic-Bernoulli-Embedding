1. Activation of glucose 6-phosphate is one of the unique properties of pyruvate kinase from Mycobacterium smegmatis. 2. Pyruvate kinase, partially purified from ultrasonic extracts of the mycobacteria by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, exhibited sigmoidal kinetics at various concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, with a high degree of co-operativity (Hill coefficient, h = 3.7) and S0.5 value of 1.0 mM. 3. In the presence of glucose 6-phosphate, the degree of co-operativity shown by the phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve was decreased to h = 2.33 and the S0.5 value was lowered to 0.47 mM. 4. The enzyme was activated by AMP and ribose 5-phosphate also, but the activation constant was lowest with glucose 6-phosphate (0.24 mM). 5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by ATP at all phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. The concentrations of ATP required to produce half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity at non-saturating (0.2 mM) and saturating (2 mM) phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations were 1.1 mM and 3 mM respectively. 6. The inhibition of ATP was partially relieved by glucose 6-phosphate. 7. The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with ADP as the variable substrate, with an apparent Km of 0.66 mM. 8. The enzyme required Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions for activity. It was not activated by univalent cations. 9. The kinetic data indicate that under physiological conditions glucose 6-phosphate probably plays a significant role in the regulation of pyruvate kinase activity.
