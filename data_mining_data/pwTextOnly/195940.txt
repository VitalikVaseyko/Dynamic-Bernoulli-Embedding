This communication introduces a nuclear relaxation approach for an estimation of the distance between two paramagnetic metal ion sites on a metal-activated enzyme. The method is based on the existence of an exchange of unpaired electron spin magnetizations between the two metals via energy-conserving concerted mutual spin flips which arise from time-dependent dipolar interactions of the electronic magnetizations. This cross-relaxation of electronic magnetizations depends on the inverse sixth power of the intermetal distance and may, under suitable conditions, affect the longitudinal relaxation rate of inner sphere water protons by altering the electron-proton dipolar correlation time when the latter is dominated by electron spin relaxation. The technique is applied to estimate the distance of 5.2 +/- 0.9 A between Mn2+ and Cr3+ in the pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-ATPCr3+ complex and indicates the existence of a van der Waals contact between the hydration spheres of the enzyme- and nucleotide-bound metal ions.
