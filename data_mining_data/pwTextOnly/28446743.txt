BACKGROUND Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in cancer tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) can induced EMT, which could increase tumor migration and invasion. Moreover, recent studies have been proven that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a critical regulator of EMT. We investigated the mechanisms of mTOR in transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced EMT in cervical cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS HeLa and SiHa cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1 to induce EMT. Then, they were treated with or without rapamycin. CCK8 assay was performed to determine cell proliferation. Cell migration was detected by wound-healing assay; apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry; mTOR inhibitors inhibited mTOR pathway to assess the expression of E-cadherin, Vimentin STAT3, Snail2, p-p70s6k, and PKM2 expression. RESULTS TGF-beta1 promoted proliferation and migration, and attenuated apoptosis in cervical carcinoma cells. Rapamycin abolished TGF-beta1-induced EMT cell proliferation and migration and reversed TGF-beta1-induced EMT. E-cadherin were suppressed, whereas Vimentin and PKM2 were increased in HeLa and SiHa cells after stimulation with TGF-beta1. Moreover, mTOR was activated in the process of TGF-beta1-induced EMT. Rapamycin inhibited the phosphorylation of p70s6k. Furthermore, inhibition of the mTOR pathway decreased PKM2 expression. CONCLUSIONS Inhibition of the mTOR pathway abolished TGF-beta1-induced EMT and reduced mTOR/p70s6k signaling, which downregulated PKM2 expression. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into the anti-tumor effects of inhibition of mTOR.
