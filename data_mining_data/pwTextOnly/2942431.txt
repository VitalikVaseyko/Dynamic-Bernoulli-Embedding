Red cell carbonic anhydrase activity, 2.3 DPG concentration, and activities of three key enzymes controlling DPG metabolism (PK, PFK and DPGM) were measured in normoxic and hypoxic (incubation in 13.5% O2) chick embryos. In normoxia 2.3 DPG concentration and carbonic anhydrase activity begin to increase by the third week of incubation. Hypoxia induces a rise of 2.3 DPG concentration and carbonic anhydrase activity by Day 8 of development, i.e., 1 week earlier. Since during normal development chick embryos become hypoxic in the third week of incubation, the results suggest that PO2 has a controlling influence on the timing of differentiation events of definitive embryonic red cells.
