The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and ATP and the activities of certain glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes were determined in Propionibacterium shermanii cultures grown on a fully defined medium with glucose, glycerol or lactate as energy source. On all three energy sources, enzyme activities were similar and pyruvate kinase was considerably more active than the gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase, indicating the need for regulation of pyruvate kinase activity. The intracellular concentration of glucose 6-phosphate, a specific activator of pyruvate kinase in this organism, changed markedly according to both the nature and the concentration of the growth substrate: the concentration (7-10 mM) during growth with excess glucose or glycerol was higher than that (1-2 mM) during growth with lactate or at growth-limiting concentrations of glycerol or glucose. Other glycolytic intermediates, apart from pyruvate, were present at concentrations below 2 mM. Glucose 6-phosphate overcame inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity by ATP and inorganic phosphate. With 1 mM-ATP and more than 10 mM inorganic phosphate, a change in glucose 6-phosphate concentration from 1-2 mM was sufficient to switch pyruvate kinase from a strongly inhibited to a fully active state. The results provide a plausible mechanism for the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in P. shermanii.
