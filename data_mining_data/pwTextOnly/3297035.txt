Two forms of pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) present in Salmonella typhimurium were purified to homogeneity from the same cultures by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and gel filtration, anion-exchange and affinity chromatography. Mr values, subunit structure, amino acid composition and activity and stability conditions were determined for the two forms. Kinetic and regulatory properties of the two purified isoenzymes were studied.
