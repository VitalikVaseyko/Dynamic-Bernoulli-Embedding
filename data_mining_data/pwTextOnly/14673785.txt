Expressed proteins and antigens from Neospora caninum tachyzoites were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Thirty-one spots corresponding to 20 different proteins were identified from N. caninum tachyzoites by peptide mass fingerprinting. Six proteins were identified from a N. caninum database (NTPase, 14-3-3 protein homologue, NcMIC1, NCDG1, NcGRA1 and NcGRA2), and 11 proteins were identified in closely related species using the T. gondii database (HSP70, HSP60, pyruvate kinase, tubulin alpha- and beta-chain, putative protein disulfide isomerase, enolase, actin, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). One hundred and two antigen spots were observed using pH 4-7 IPG strips on immunoblot profiles. Among them, 17 spots corresponding to 11 antigenic proteins were identified from a N. caninum protein map. This study involved the construction of in-depth protein maps for N. caninum tachyzoites, which will be of value for studies of its pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and phylogenetic studies.
