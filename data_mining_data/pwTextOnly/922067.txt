A conversion of the reaction of two cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, phosphoglycerate mutase and phosphopyruvate hydratase, is necessary for sucrose synthesis from pyruvate in leaves of C4-plants in the light, when phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis from pyruvate and phosphoglycerate reduction can be carried out by chloroplasts. Leaves of C4-plants differ from those of C3-plants in a higher activity of cytoplasmic glycolysis enzymes, which are distributed irregularly in two assimilatory tissues. The ratio of pyruvate kinase and enolase reaction activities is high in parenchyma linings of vascular fascicles (where mitochondria are concentrated), and it is low in mesophyl tissue, where phosphoglucerate in equilibrium phosphoenolpyruvate reaction is included into photosynthetic metabolism. The data obtained on isolated mesophyl protoplasts have shown that the reaction equilibrium is sharply shifted into the direction of phosphoenolpyruvate formation from phosphoglycerate. However, the incorporation of 14C into sugars is not completely inhibited in the atmosphere of N2-A possibility of incorporation of tri-carbon fragments into sugars in photosynthesizing leaves via conversion of enolase reaction and via alternative pathways is discussed.
