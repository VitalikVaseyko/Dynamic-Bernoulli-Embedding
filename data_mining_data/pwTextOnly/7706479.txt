DNA analysis was performed on 30 unrelated patients with hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) who had been found to be pyruvate kinase (PK) deficient by enzyme assay. 19 different mutations were identified among 58 of the 60 alleles at risk. 13 of these were missense mutations that caused single amino acid changes. Included were the following nucleotide substitutions: 401A, 464C, 993A, 1022C, 1076A, 1178G, 1179A, 1373A, 1378A, 1456T, 1484T, 1493A, 1529A. The remaining six mutations were as follows: two nonsense mutations, 721T and 808T; a nucleotide deletion, 307C; a nucleotide insertion, 1089GG; a three nucleotide in frame deletion, 391-392-393 and a deletion of 1149 bp from the PKLR gene that resulted in the loss of exon 11. All the patients were studied for two polymorphic sites, nucleotide (nt) 1705 A/C and a microsatellite in intron 11, to better understand the origin of the mutations. The 1529A mutation, which is the most common mutation in the European population, was found in 25 alleles. With a single exception this mutation was in linkage disequilibrium with both of the polymorphic markers, i.e., found with 1705C and 14 repeats in the microsatellite. This finding is consistent with a single origin of this common mutation. Other mutations occurring more than once were of much lower frequency than the 1529A mutation.
