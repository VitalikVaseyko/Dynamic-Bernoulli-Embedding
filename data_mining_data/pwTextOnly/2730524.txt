Regional glucose uptake in perfused hearts, and the activities of several glycolytic enzymes contributing to the glucose metabolism in perfused and nonperfused hearts were studied in male and female rats after 8-9 weeks of swimming training. The left ventricular glucose uptake showed a transmural gradient in the sedentary animals, the subendocardial uptake being 30% and 12% higher than that of the subepicardial layer in the males and females, respectively. Swimming exercise abolished the left ventricular glucose uptake gradient in male rats, and in female rats an opposite gradient was found, the subepicardial uptake being 23% higher than the subendocardial uptake. The activities of phosphofructokinase and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase also showed transmural gradients in the left ventricles. Training did not abolish these gradients. Training-induced changes in the activities of phosphofructokinase, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase were found in certain sites of the myocardium. Perfusion of isolated hearts for 50 min with insulin-containing Krebs-Ringer buffer especially affected the activities of phosphofructokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and citrate synthase, increasing these activities in the left ventricles and decreasing them in the atria. These results indicate that there are regional differences between male and female rats in the cardiac glucose uptake rate after swimming training.
