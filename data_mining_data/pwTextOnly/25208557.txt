Tyrosine phosphorylation (p-Y105) of pyruvate kinase (PK) M2, in recent years, has been suggested to facilitate Warburg effect and tumor cell growth. However, a comparison of the structural dynamics of the un-phosphorylated, the active, and the phosphorylated-at-Y105, the inactive-states, is not clear. We studied molecular dynamics of the two states to unravel these features, where phosphorylated PKM2 showed a rapid global conformation change in the initial stages of the simulation. The overall simulation identified that the phosphorylation event results in more buried and less flexible PKM2 conformation, as compared to the un-phosphorylated form, resulting in an open and closed conformation of the active site in un-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, respectively, due to the movement of B domain. This conformational shift in Y105-phosphorylated-PKM2 (p-Y105-PKM2) with closed active site, responsible for inhibition of PKM2 activity, was an outcome of the bending residues (117-118, 218-219, 296-297, and 301-308) within the loop connecting A and B domains and the presence of helix-loop-helix motif in A domain. The un-phosphorylated PKM2 formed a helix bend (H4) due to less fluctuation of the residue S-100; where the other end of the helix (H4) was connected to the substrate binding pocket. Further, simulation analysis showed that phosphorylation did not affect the FBP binding predominantly. We propose that p-Y105 inhibits the activity of PKM2 without influencing FBP binding directly and not allowing the open binding conformation by influencing G128, S100, G506 and gamma turn, G126 and S127 residues. Phosphorylated PKM2 was also identified to gain the transcriptional factor function which was not the case with un-phosphorylated form. These structurally important residues in PKM2 could have a bearing on cancer metabolism, since PKM2 has been implicated in the promotion of cancer in the recent past.
