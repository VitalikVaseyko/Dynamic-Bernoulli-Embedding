1. The activities of four enzymes of glycolysis were assayed in the liver of five different strains of rats (four ;Wistar-derived', one Sprague-Dawley) kept on three different but very similar diets. 2. Major strain differences were found for the activities of pyruvate kinase (3-fold), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (5-fold), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (3-fold) and triokinase (1.5-fold). 3. Although the initial activities of pyruvate kinase differed greatly the percentage responses to starvation or a diet high in soluble carbohydrate were of the same order in two strains. 4. The importance of considering strain differences is emphasized when making comparisons of measurements carried out in different laboratories.
