Sulfoenolpyruvate, the analogue of phosphoenolpyruvate in which the phosphate ester has been replaced by a sulfate ester, has been synthesized in three chemical steps from ethyl bromopyruvate in 40% overall yield. This compound is a substrate for pyruvate kinase, producing pyruvate and adenosine 5'-sulfatopyrophosphate. The latter compound has been identified by NMR spectroscopy and by comparison with an authentic sample. Sulfuryl transfer from sulfoenolpyruvate is 250-600-fold slower than phosphate transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate under identical conditions. Sulfoenolpyruvate is not a substrate for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Kinetic studies reveal that it does not bind to the active site; instead, it binds to the site normally occupied by glucose 6-phosphate and activates the enzyme in a manner similar to that shown by glucose 6-phosphate.
