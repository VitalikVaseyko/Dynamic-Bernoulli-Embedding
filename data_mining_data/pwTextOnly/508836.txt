In solutions of creatine kinase, actin and lactic dehydrogenase oscillations of SH-groups are revealed by three independent methods using three different reagents AgNO3, PCMB, DTNB. The variations of the SH-group titre remain after denaturation of the individual protein solution portions. In the solutions of predenaturated proteins no titre oscillations are observed. Possible cause of the observed oscillations of SH-groups titre may be reversible SH--SS transformation.
