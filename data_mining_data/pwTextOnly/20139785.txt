INTRODUCTION: The hypothesis that brief intermittent exercise-induced increases in human skeletal muscle metabolic mRNA is dependent on relative workload was investigated. METHODS: Trained (n = 10) and untrained (n = 8) subjects performed exhaustive intermittent cycling exercise (4 x 4 min at 85% of VO(2peak), interspersed by 3 min). Trained subjects also performed the intermittent exercise at the same absolute workload as the untrained subjects, corresponding to 70% of VO(2peak) (n = 6). RESULTS: Exercise at 85% of V(O2peak) elevated (P < 0.001) venous plasma lactate to 10.1 +/- 0.4 and 10.8 +/- 0.5 mM in the trained and untrained subjects, respectively. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA expression was increased (P < 0.001) approximately four- to fivefold for several hours after exercise in both groups. After exercise at 70% of VO(2peak), venous plasma lactate was less (P < 0.001) elevated (3.1 +/- 0.7 mM) and PGC-1alpha mRNA content was less (P < 0.05) increased (approximately threefold) than after exercise at 85% of VO(2peak). Likewise, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and hexokinase II mRNA expressions were increased (P < 0.05) only after exercise performed at 85% of VO(2peak) in the trained subjects. Hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha mRNA only increased (P < 0.05) 3 h into recovery in trained subjects, with no difference between the 70% and 85% of VO(2peak) trial. No change in hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase, or lactate dehydrogenase, heart and muscle isoforms, mRNA expressions was detected after any of the exercise trials. CONCLUSIONS: The relative intensity of brief intermittent exercise is of major importance for the exercise-induced increase of several mRNA, including PGC-1alpha.
