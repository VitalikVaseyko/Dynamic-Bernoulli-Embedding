Changes in gene expression during recovery from high-intensity, intermittent, one-legged exercise were studied before and after 5.5 wk of training. Genes related to metabolism, as well as Na+, K+, and pH homeostasis, were selected for analyses. After the same work was performed before and after the training period, several muscle biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis muscle. In the untrained state, the Na+-K+-ATPase alpha1-subunit mRNA level was approximately threefold higher (P < 0.01) at 0, 1, and 3 h after exercise, relative to the preexercise resting level. After 3-5 h of recovery in the untrained state, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 and hexokinase II mRNA levels were elevated 13-fold (P < 0.001) and 6-fold (P < 0.01), respectively. However, after the training period, only pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA levels were elevated (P < 0.05) during the recovery period. No changes in resting mRNA levels were observed as a result of training. In conclusion, cellular adaptations to high-intensity exercise training may, in part, be induced by transcriptional regulation. After training, the transcriptional response to an exercise bout at a given workload is diminished.
