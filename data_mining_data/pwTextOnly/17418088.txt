We report here initial studies on phosphoenolpyruvate metabolism in coupled mitochondria isolated from Jerusalem artichoke tubers. It was found that: (1) phosphoenolpyruvate can be metabolized by Jerusalem artichoke mitochondria by virtue of the presence of the mitochondrial pyruvate kinase, shown both immunologically and functionally, located in the inner mitochondrial compartments and distinct from the cytosolic pyruvate kinase as shown by the different pH and inhibition profiles. (2) Jerusalem artichoke mitochondria can take up externally added phosphoenolpyruvate in a proton compensated manner, in a carrier-mediated process which was investigated by measuring fluorimetrically the oxidation of intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotide which occurs as a result of phosphoenolpyruvate uptake and alternative oxidase activation. (3) The addition of phosphoenolpyruvate causes pyruvate and ATP production, as monitored via HPLC, with their efflux into the extramitochondrial phase investigated fluorimetrically. Such an efflux occurs via the putative phosphoenolpyruvate/pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate/ATP antiporters, which differ from each other and from the pyruvate and the adenine nucleotide carriers, in the light of the different sensitivity to non-penetrant compounds. These carriers were shown to regulate the rate of efflux of both pyruvate and ATP. The appearance of citrate and oxaloacetate outside mitochondria was also found as a result of phosphoenolpyruvate addition.
