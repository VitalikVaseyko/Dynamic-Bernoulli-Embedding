The application of embryo-related technology is dependent on in vitro culture systems. Unfortunately, most culture media are suboptimal and result in developmentally compromised embryos. Since embryo development is partially dependent upon Warburg Effect-like metabolism, our goal was to test the response of embryos treated with compounds that are known to stimulate or enhance this Effect. One such compound is 5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-3-phenyl-pent-2-enoic acid (PS48). When added during oocyte maturation, the quality of the resultant embryos was compromised, whereas when added to the culture medium after fertilization, PS48 improved both the percentage of embryos that reach the blastocyst stage and the number of nuclei in those blastocysts. Embryonic PS48 treatment resulted in more phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) in blastocyst-stage embryos as compared to the controls. Further, PS48 could replace bovine serum albumin in embryo culture medium, as demonstrated by high-quality embryos that were developmentally competent. The action of PS48 appears to be via stimulation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase and phosphorylation of AKT, which is consistent with stimulation of the Warburg Effect.
