Metastatic dissemination is associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. While exploring glucose metabolism in metastatic progenitor cells, we recently found that several different dysfunctions that share the ability to induce mitochondrial superoxide production also promote tumor metastasis. Selective targeting of mitochondrial superoxide prevented spontaneous metastasis in mice, opening a new avenue for therapy.
