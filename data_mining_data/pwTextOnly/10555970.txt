The interaction of pyruvate kinase from skeletal (SKPK) and smooth (SMPK) muscle with MM-creatine kinase (MMCK) and BB-creatine kinase (BBCK) was assessed using temporal absorbance changes, variations in absorbance at different wavelengths, concentration dependence, association in an electric field, and PK kinetic activity. SKPK exhibits a time course of absorbance increase in the presence of MMCK with a time constant of 29.5 min. This increase occurs at all wavelength from 240 to 1000 nm. At 195 nm, the combination of SKPK and MMCK produces a decrease in absorption with electric fields of both 0 and 204 V/cm. The change in SKPK-MMCK is saturable. SKPK activity is significantly increased by the presence of MMCK in solutions of 0-32% ethanol. These results indicate specific SKPK-MMCK interaction. SMPK and BBCK did not exhibit similar coupling when the BBCK concentration dependence of absorbance or SMPK activity in solutions of 0-32% ethanol was determined. Both MMCK and BBCK increased SKPK activity; neither MMCK nor BBCK increased SMPK activity. The ability to form diazymatic complexes with creatine kinase appears to reside in SKPK. This coupling may account for the increased flux through PK without significant substrate changes seen during skeletal muscle activation. This coupling will not occur in smooth muscle.
