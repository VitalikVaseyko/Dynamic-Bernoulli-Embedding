The present study examines the effect of sustained exercise on glycolysis and fatty acids oxidation in the swimming muscles and liver in juvenile tinfoil barb (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii). The subjects were divided into one control group (water current speed of 0.0 bl s(-1), body length per second) and two training groups (1.0 and 2.0 bl s(-1)), respectively. Results showed that the glycolysis was stimulated by high-speed training in the white muscle, accompanied by significantly increased activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and reduction in glycogen contents in training groups (P < 0.05). On the contrary, the extreme fatty acids oxidation was observed in the red muscle in high-speed training group, showed significant reduction in crude lipid content with a significant increase in the activities of hormone-sensitive lipase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and cytochrome C oxidase in 2.0 bl s(-1) group (P < 0.05). In addition, the saturated fatty acids in the red muscle and monounsaturated fatty acids in the white muscle were used preferentially during sustained training, respectively. Furthermore, the glycogen content within the liver was also significantly reduced with increasing training intensities (P < 0.05). These results suggested that glycogen and fatty acids were all used as a fuel to support sustained swimming in two functional muscles in B. schwanenfeldii, but higher glycolysis and fatty acids oxidation were seen in white and red muscles during high-speed swimming, respectively. Furthermore, the hepatic glycogen played an important role in the supply of energy in sustained training periods in B. schwanenfeldii.
