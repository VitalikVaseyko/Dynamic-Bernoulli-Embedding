In rat kidney several mitochondrial and soluble enzyme activities are stimulated by thyroid hormones and the mitochondrial membrane fluidity is also increased. However, the ketone metabolism enzyme activities of D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and of 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase are not significantly affected by the hyperthyroid state and the ketone body concentration is not greatly changed. Therefore, in hyperthyroid rats the response of the kidney, as far as the ketone bodies and their metabolizing enzymes are concerned, is at variance with that of the liver and the heart. In the brain of young rats, age 8-9 weeks, the activities of the enzymes of ketone body metabolism and those responsible for other metabolic pathways are not influenced by the hyperthyroid state. In these animals, however, the activities of two enzymes, NAD-isocitrate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, are still stimulated by 28 and 41%, respectively. This can be probably related to the higher energy requirement for definitive brain maturation in young hyperthyroid rats.
