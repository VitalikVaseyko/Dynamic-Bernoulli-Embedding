The expression and regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene were not grossly modified by feeding rats a 3'-methyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene-containing diet despite maximum expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene being dramatically reduced as early as the 24th hour of the carcinogenic diet. Inhibition of aldolase B mRNA synthesis occurred more slowly, being maximum at the 3rd day. After stopping administration of the carcinogen, a very rapid, but transient increase of the L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA was observed at the 24th hour, whereas aldolase B mRNA increased only slowly. The amount of aldolase A mRNA fell quickly after termination of carcinogen administration, levels being normal at the 2nd-3rd day. At this time, the histological structure of the liver was indistinguishable from that of animals still receiving the azo-dye diet. It appears, therefore, that in the rat both administration and withdrawal of the azo-dye carcinogen induce rapid modifications of the expression of some genes, before any cellular modification is distinguishable.
