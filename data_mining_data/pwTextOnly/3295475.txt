The effects of chronic renal failure on the enzyme activity of pyruvate kinase and the mRNA level of this enzyme were studied in 7 out of 8 nephrectomized rats. The mRNA level was measured by RNA-DNA dot blot hybridization, using cloned pyruvate kinase cDNA as hybridized probe. Neither the activity of M1-type pyruvate kinase nor the level of this enzyme in rat gastrocnemius muscle was affected by chronic renal failure, whereas L-type pyruvate kinase enzyme activity in uremic rat liver was lower than that in control at both fasted and refed states. The levels of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA were not different between two groups at the fasted state. Induction of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA after high carbohydrate diet refeeding was suppressed proportionally to the severity of chronic renal failure, which was expressed by the serum creatinine concentrations (r = -.876, P less than .005). These results indicate that the suppression of L-type pyruvate kinase activity in uremia was partly reflected by the decreased accumulation of this enzyme mRNA. There was a significantly negative correlation between L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA levels and plasma glucagon/insulin ratios (r = -.719, P less than .05). Hyperglucagonemia in uremia might play a major role in this suppression.
