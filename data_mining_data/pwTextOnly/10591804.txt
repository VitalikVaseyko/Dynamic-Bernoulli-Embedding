PURPOSE: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours. Purpose of this study was to demonstrate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology. METHOD: After deparaffinization of formaline-fixed tissue (5 original tumours, 2 metastases and 5 benign renal tissues) cells were stained (APAAP-method) with Clon DF4 (ScheBo Tech). RESULTS: All malign tissue showed a positive reaction, inside benign tissue we saw a positive reaction of endothelial cells however we saw no reaction with benign renal cells. CONCLUSION: Renal cell carcinoma and metastatic cells show a strong immunohistological reaction against the inactive form of pyruvatekinase, no reaction of benign renal cells. It should be possible to develop a serological tumour marker for renal cell carcinoma.
