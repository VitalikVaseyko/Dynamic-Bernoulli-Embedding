Nineteen enzymes showing highest activity in liver were examined in human and rodent tissues and cultured cells using starch-gel electrophoresis. The rat hepatoma line Faza 967 strongly expressed 13 of these enzymes. A series of somatic cell hybrids, constructed between Faza and cells of non-hepatic origin derived from man or from Chinese hamster, were examined for expression of these enzymes. Some of the human/rat hybrids continued to produce rat liver-specific enzymes, and the human forms of the enzymes glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase L were reexpressed in a few cases.
