The possibility of thiamine phosphates to participate in the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity on the level of isolated mitochondria is studied. It is shown that an increase in the thiamine diphosphate concentration in incubation medium produces no significant changes in the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity of mitochondria. The pyruvate dehydrogenase activity decreases when mitochondria are incubated with thiamine triphosphate or ATP under different conditions. Thiamine triphosphate is not able to replace ATP in kinase reaction of the isolated complex, but it inhibits reactivation of the complex with exogenase phosphatase; under the same conditions thiamine diphosphate activates phosphatase. Analysis of these data leads to conclusion that under native conditions an increase of the intramitochondrial thiamine triphosphate concentration can produce a drop in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity by inhibition of the phosphatase reaction.
