The activity of glycolytic and oxidative enzymes was monitored in the white muscle of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua experiencing different growth rates. A strong positive relationship between the activity of two glycolytic enzymes and individual growth rate was observed regardless of whether the enzyme activity was expressed as units per gram wet mass, units per gram dry mass or with respect to muscle protein and DNA content. The most sensitive response to growth rate was observed when pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were expressed as units per microgram DNA, and this may be useful as an indicator of growth rate in wild fish. In contrast, no relationship between the activities of oxidative enzymes and growth rate was observed when cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activities were expressed as units per gram protein. Apparently, the aerobic capacity of white muscle in cod is not specifically increased to match growth rate.
