Mitochondria are known to play a key role in various cellular processes essential to both the life and death of cells, including calcium homeostasis, programmed cell death, and energy metabolism. Over 80 years ago, Otto Warburg discovered that in contrast to normal cells which produce most of their ATP via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for production of ATP, a phenomenon known today as the "Warburg effect", and one which has been of great importance in the emergence of novel drugs and chemotherapeutic agents specifically targeting cancer cells. Several groups have reported in recent years that members of the plant stress hormones family of jasmonates, and some of their synthetic derivatives, exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Jasmonates have been shown to act directly on mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial swelling, membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release. Throughout the last few years, different groups have demonstrated that combination of jasmonates and various cytotoxic and chemotherapeutic agents yielded a synergistic cytotoxic effect. These results have been demonstrated in a variety of different cancer cell lines and may provide a strong basis for future clinical treatments which involve combination of MJ and different anti-cancerous agents. The potential synergistic effect may allow reduction of the administered dose, decrease of unwanted side effects, and reduction of the likelihood that the tumor will display resistance to the combined therapy.
