The activities of enzymes related to energy metabolism in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles in young-adult (4 months), mature (12 months) and senescent (24 months) rats were compared after 72 h of continuous exposure to normobaric hypoxia or normoxia after alpha-adrenergic antagonist nicergoline or saline solution had been given intraperitoneally for 30 consecutive days. The maximum rates (Vmax) of the following enzyme activities in the crude extract and/or the mitochondrial fraction of each muscle specimen were evaluated: (1) for the anaerobic glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase; (2) for the tricarboxylic acid cycle; citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase; (3) for the electron transfer chain; cytochrome oxidase; and (4) for the NAD+/NADH redox state: total NADH cytochrome c reductase. The significant differences between the enzyme activities at different ages or under different experimental conditions in the two tissue preparations of the two muscles were determined by ANOVA. MCA and ETA were used to evaluate the net effects of the experimental conditions. Ageing did not seem to affect the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles in the same way. Changes were seen only in the glycolytic pathway enzymes in the crude extract from the gastrocnemius muscle. In the soleus muscle changes in enzyme activities as a function of ageing were also found in the mitochondrial fraction. We also found that hypoxia caused greater changes in 12-month-old rats than in those of other ages (especially in the enzyme activities of the gastrocnemius muscle). Finally out data show that only in certain cases was the pharmacological treatment able to modify the influence of hypoxic conditions on the levels of enzyme activities, regardless of the age of animals.
