1. The proton-transfer reactions of yeast pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) were studied. Proton-transfer from C-3 of phosphoenolpyruvate to water occurs only in the presence of the phosphoryl-acceptor ADP. Proton transfer from C-3 of pyruvate to water occurs only in the presence of ATP. However, the proton transfer in the latter case occurs 10-100 times faster than phosphoryl transfer; this supports a mechanism in which proton transfer precedes phosphoryl transfer in the reverse reaction of pyruvate kinase. 2. The characteristics of proton-transfer reactions of yeast pyruvate kinase were compared with those previously reported for rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (Robinson, JL. and Rose, I.A. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 1096-1105). The pH-profiles and the divalent cation dependencies were similar for Fru-1,6-P2-activated yeast pyruvate kinase and the muscle enzyme. Pyruvate enolization by yeast pyruvate kinase has an absolute requirement for ATP in contrast to enolization by the muscle enzyme which proceeds when ATP is replaced by Pi or other dianions. 3. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was shown to affect the catelytic steps of yeast pyruvate kinase in addition to the binding of substrates. Its role depends on the divalent cation used to activate the enzyme.
