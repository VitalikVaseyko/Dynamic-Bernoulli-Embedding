AIM: Our earlier study demonstrated antidiabetic activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZON) in diabetic rats. The present study was performed to elucidate its mechanism of antidiabetic action. METHODS: Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, protein kinase B and hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation; glucose transporter 4 translocation and glucose uptake; glucose 6 phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase and glucokinase expression; and pancreatic beta cell proliferation were evaluated after ZON treatment to cells. RESULT: ZON treatment resulted in PKB activation, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inactivation, increased glucose transporter 4 translocation and enhanced glucose uptake, decreased glucose 6 phosphatase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase expression, hormone sensitive lipase inactivation and pancreatic beta cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time, pleiotropic antidiabetic effects of ZON viz. improved insulin signaling, enhanced glucose uptake, decreased hepatic glucose output, decreased lipolysis and enhanced pancreatic beta cell mass.
