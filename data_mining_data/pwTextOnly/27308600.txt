The metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis as a hallmark of highly aggressive cancer was postulated by Otto Warburg in the 1920s. We identified baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5, also known as survivin) as a key player in mitochondrial metabolism and our recent findings suggest glycolysis inhibitors as powerful agents to overcome the antiapoptotic function of survivin in neuroblastoma.
