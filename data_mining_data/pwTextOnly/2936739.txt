A new adenine nucleotide analog, [3H]pyridoxal 5'-diphospho-5'-adenosine (PLP-AMP), has been synthesized. The effectiveness of PLP-AMP as an affinity probe has been tested using a number of nucleotide-binding enzymes. In comparison to reaction with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP-AMP binds more tightly and exhibits greater specificity of labeling for most enzymes tested. PLP-AMP is a very potent inhibitor of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, with complete inhibition obtained upon incorporation of 1 mol of reagent/mol of catalytic subunit. The reagent is also a potent inhibitor of yeast hexokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase. When modified in the absence of substrates, these enzymes require 2 mol of reagent/mol of active site for complete inhibition. However, when modified in the presence of sugar substrates, this stoichiometry decreases to 1.1 for the hexokinase-glucose complex and 1.4 for the phosphoglycerate kinase . 3-phosphoglycerate complex. The most potent inhibition by PLP-AMP was observed with rabbit muscle adenylate kinase. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at a concentration of approximately 1 microM. In contrast to these examples, PLP-AMP, as well as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, fails to act as a potent or specific inhibitor of beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATP-ase. The high specificity of labeling and the ability of nucleotide substrates to decrease the rate of inactivation of the kinases and dehydrogenase are consistent with the modification of active site residues. The complete reversibility of both modification and inactivation in the absence of reduction by NaBH4 and the absorption spectra of modified enzymes prior to and following reduction indicate reaction with lysyl residues. We conclude that PLP-AMP holds considerable promise as an affinity label for exploring the structure and mechanism of nucleotide-binding enzymes.
