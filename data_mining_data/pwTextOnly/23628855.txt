UNLABELLED: Seedlings of Citrus sinensis were fertilized with boron (B)-deficient (0muM H3BO3) or -sufficient (10muM H3BO3) nutrient solution for 15weeks. Thereafter, iTRAQ analysis was employed to compare the abundances of proteins from B-deficient and -sufficient roots. In B-deficient roots, 164 up-regulated and 225 down-regulated proteins were identified. These proteins were grouped into the following functional categories: protein metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, cell transport, cell wall and cytoskeleton metabolism, biological regulation and signal transduction, and lipid metabolism. The adaptive responses of roots to B-deficiency might include following several aspects: (a) decreasing root respiration; (b) improving the total ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (c) enhancing cell transport. The differentially expressed proteins identified by iTRAQ are much larger than those detected using 2D gel electrophoresis, and many novel B-deficiency-responsive proteins involved in cell transport, biological regulation and signal transduction, stress responses and other metabolic processes were identified in this work. Our results indicate remarkable metabolic flexibility of citrus roots, which may contribute to the survival of B-deficient plants. This represents the most comprehensive analysis of protein profiles in response to B-deficiency. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we identified many new proteins involved in cell transport, biological regulation and signal transduction, stress responses and other metabolic processes that were not previously known to be associated with root B-deficiency responses. Therefore, our manuscript represents the most comprehensive analysis of protein profiles in response to B-deficiency and provides new information about the plant response to B-deficiency.
