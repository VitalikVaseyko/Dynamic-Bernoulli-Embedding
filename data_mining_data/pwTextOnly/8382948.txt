In this paper the substrate activities and binding affinities of the stereoisomers of the beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP and alpha,beta, gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP complexes toward selected members of the kinase family of enzymes are reported. Hexokinase and glycerokinase were found to be specific for the delta beta, gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer as substrate while adenylate kinase was found to specifically catalyze the reaction of the delta beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer. Pyruvate kinase recognized both the delta beta,gamma-bidentate Rh(H2O)4ATP isomer and the delta beta-P, exo alpha-P alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP isomer as substrates in the catalyzed phosphorylation of the alternate substrate, glycolate. 31P NMR analysis of the respective product complexes showed that alpha-P phosphoryl ligand exchange had not preceded or followed catalysis. Creatine kinase was found to be specific for the delta beta-P, exo alpha-P alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Rh(H2O)3ATP isomer. Discrimination of the Rh(H2O)nATP isomers via preferential binding of the substrate-active isomer was observed for hexokinase and adenylate kinase but not for glycerokinase, fructose-6 phosphate kinase, creatine kinase, arginine kinase, or acetate kinase.
