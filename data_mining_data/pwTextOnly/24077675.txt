Cancers of diverse origins exhibit marked glucose avidity and high rates of aerobic glycolysis. Increased understanding of this dysfunctional metabolism known as the Warburg effect has led to an interest in targeting it for cancer therapy. One promising strategy for such targeting is glycoconjugation, the linking of a drug to glucose or another sugar. This review summarizes the most salient examples of glycoconjugates, in which known cytotoxins or targeted anticancer therapeutics have been linked to glucose (or another glucose transporter substrate sugar) for improved cancer targeting and selectivity. Building on these examples, this review also provides a series of guidelines for the design and mechanistic evaluation of future glycoconjugates.
