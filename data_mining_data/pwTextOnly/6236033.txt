The glycolytic process in non-infected and A. marginale-infected bovine erythrocytes was studied. The study included four enzymes: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvic kinase and lactic dehydrogenase, and the intracellular concentrations of glucose, ATP and 2,3 diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG). The activities of phosphofructokinase and lactic dehydrogenase found in non-infected bovine erythrocytes were fifty times greater than the previously reported values. Glucose and DPG concentrations, hexokinase, pyruvic kinase and lactic dehydrogenase specific activities did not change significantly during experimental anaplasmosis. Phosphofructokinase activity in A. marginale-infected erythrocytes increased to values 300% of those found in intact bovine red cells. ATP concentration in infected erythrocytes decreased to values of 40% of those found in non-infected cells: from 1.60 +/- 0.40 to 0.70 +/- 0.08 mumole per gram of hemoglobin.
