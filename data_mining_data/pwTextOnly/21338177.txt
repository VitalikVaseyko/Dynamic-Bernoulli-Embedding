Cancer and metabolism, namely that of glucose, share a reciprocal relationship. Discovered 80 years ago, the so-called Warburg effect remains a conundrum both teleologically and mechanistically and thus, has been thoughtfully endowed with respectful attention. With the progress of years, scientific contributions have managed to solve parts of this mystery. The present review aims to be a reviewing prelude to most recent findings regarding the connection of cancer with glucose metabolism.
