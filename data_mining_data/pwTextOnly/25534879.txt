BACKGROUND & AIMS: We hypothesized that the so far poorly understood improvement in postoperative insulin sensitivity, when surgery is preceded by a carbohydrate (CHO) drink, occurs via attenuation of skeletal muscle inflammatory responses to surgery, improved insulin signaling and attenuated expression of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4. METHODS: Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, collected before and after major abdominal surgery and during postoperative hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamping from 16 pigs randomized to either 200 ml of a CHO-supplemented drink 2 h before surgery (CHO, 25 g; n = 8), or preoperative overnight fasting (fasted; n = 8), were analyzed by fast qRT-PCR and IR-Western blotting. RESULTS: During clamping, expression of IKKbeta, SOCS3 and the ratio of phosphorylated/total JNK2 proteins were lower in the CHO group than in the fasted group (-1.0 vs. 2.9-fold, P < 0.001; -0.6 vs. 3.2-fold, P < 0.01; and -0.5 vs. 1.1-fold, P < 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the ratio of Ser(307)-phosphorylated (inhibition)/total IRS1 protein was reduced only in the CHO group (-2.4 fold, P < 0.02), whereas FOXO1 phosphorylation (inactivation), which correlated negatively with PDK4 mRNA (r(2) = 0.275, P < 0.05), was lower in the CHO group than in the fasted group (-1.1-fold, P > 0.05 vs. -2.3-fold, P = 0.05). Post-surgery, PDK4 mRNA increased approximately 20-fold (P < 0.01) in both groups, but was reversed to a greater extent by insulin in the CHO group (-40.5 vs. -22.7-fold, P < 0.05), resulting in 5-fold lower PDK4 protein levels, which correlated negatively with insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal rates (r(2) = -0.265, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative carbohydrate supplementation was found to ameliorate postoperative insulin sensitivity by reducing muscle inflammatory responses and improved insulin inhibition of FOXO1-mediated PDK4 mRNA and protein expression after surgery.
