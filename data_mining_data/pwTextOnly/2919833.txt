When incubated with solutions of hydrogen peroxide, erythrocytes of stress-susceptible pigs produced more by-products of lipid peroxidation (as measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS]) than did erythrocytes from stress-resistant pigs. Using this technique, discrimination between the 2 pig types was absolute at hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0.9 and 1.5%. This was in contrast to other methods of identifying stress-susceptible pigs, such as osmotically induced erythrocyte lysis and the determination of plasma pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase activities, for which considerable overlap of data was observed between pig types. The increased TBARS production by erythrocytes was further evidence for the existence of an antioxidant abnormality in stress-susceptible pigs. However, because there were no discernible differences in the major blood antioxidant-related values between stress-susceptible and stress-resistant pigs, the nature of the defect remains unclear. The production of TBARS by erythrocytes when incubated with hydrogen peroxide provides an improved method for identifying stress-susceptible pigs.
