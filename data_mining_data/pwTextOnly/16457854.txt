The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of pyruvate and to characterize the mechanism underlying the protection. Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups. Two groups were administered saline orally (sham, ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) control group) and animals of third group received pyruvate (500 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. On the 29th day, animals of the I-R control and pyruvate treated groups underwent 45 min of occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and were thereafter reperfused for 60 min. In the I-R control group, a significant cardiac necrosis, depressed mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), decline in myocardial antioxidant status and elevation in lipid peroxidation were observed as compared to sham control. Pyruvate treatment restored the myocardial antioxidant status and favorably modulated the altered MAP as compared to I-R control. Furthermore, I/R-induced lipid peroxidation was significantly inhibited by pyruvate treatment. These beneficial cardioprotective effects translated into significant improvement in MAP. Histopathological examination and restored specific myocardial injury marker CK-MB isoenzyme activity further confirmed protective effects of pyruvate. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that the beneficial effect of pyruvate likely results from improved MAP and suppression of oxidative stress.
