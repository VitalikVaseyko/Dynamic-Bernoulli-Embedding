The study of alterations of tumor metabolism should allow the identification of new targets for innovative anticancer strategies. Metabolic alterations are generally established in vitro, and conclusions are often extrapolated to the in vivo situation without further tumor metabolic phenotyping. To highlight the key role of microenvironment on tumor metabolism, we studied the response of glycolytic and oxidative tumor models to metabolic modulations in vitro and in vivo. MDA-MB-231 and SiHa tumor models, characterized in vitro as glycolytic and oxidative, respectively, were studied. Theoretically, when passing from a hypoxic state to an oxygenated state, a Warburg phenotype should conserve a glycolytic metabolism, whereas an oxidative phenotype should switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism (Pasteur effect). This challenge was applied in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the impact of different oxic conditions on glucose metabolism. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, lactate production, tumor oxygenation, and metabolic fluxes were monitored in vivo using positron emission tomography, microdialysis, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, and (13)C-hyperpolarizated magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. In vitro, MDA-MB-231 cells were glycolytic under both hypoxic and oxygenated conditions, whereas SiHa cells underwent a metabolic shift after reoxygenation. On the contrary, in vivo, the increase in tumor oxygenation (induced by carbogen challenge) led to a similar metabolic shift in glucose metabolism in both tumor models. The major discordance in metabolic patterns observed in vitro and in vivo highlights that any extrapolation of in vitro metabolic profiling to the in vivo situation should be taken cautiously and that metabolic phenotyping using molecular imaging is mandatory in vivo.
