It has been established that in cells of Nocardia vaccinii IMB B-7405 (surfactant producer) glucose catabolism is performed through pentose phosphate cycle as well as through gluconate (activity of NAD+-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and FAD+-dependent glucose dehydrogenase 835 +/- 41 and 698 +/- 35 nmol.min-1.mg-1 of protein respectively). 6-Phosphogluconate formed in the gluconokinase reaction is involved in the pentose phosphate cycle (activity of constitutive NADP+-dependent 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 357 +/- 17 nmol.min-1.mg-1 of protein). Glycerol catabolism to dihydroxyacetonephosphate (the intermediate of glycolysis) may be performed in two ways: through glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol kinase activity 244 +/- 12 nmol.min-1.mg-1 of protein) and through dihydroxyacetone. Replenishment of the C4-dicarboxylic acids pool in N. vaccinii IMV B-7405 grown on glucose and glycerol occurs in the phosphoenolpyruvate(PEP)carboxylase reaction (714-803 nmol.min-1.mg-1 of protein). 2-Oxoglutarate was involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle by alternate pathway with the participation of 2-oxoglutarate synthase. The observed activity of both key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (PEP-carboxykinase and PEP-synthase), trehalose phosphate synthase and NADP+-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase confirmed the ability of IMV B-7405 strain to the synthesis of surface active glycoand aminolipids, respectively.
