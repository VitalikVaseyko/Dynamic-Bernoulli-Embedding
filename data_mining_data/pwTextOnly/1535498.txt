The effect of ascorbic acid on the key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism e.g. hexokinases, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme was determined in regenerating mouse liver. All the enzymes showed a significant increase in the activity during regeneration. Ascorbic acid reduced the activities of the enzymes in regenerating liver. A decrease in liver weight in ascorbic acid treated animals may be correlated with its effect on these enzymes as glycolytic pathway is the main source of energy required by the dividing cells.
