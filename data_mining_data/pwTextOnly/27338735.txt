MicroRNAs play critical roles in regulating cell survival under multiple pathological conditions of heart diseases. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis contributes greatly to heart ischemia-reperfusion injury. Herein, we describe a novel regulatory role of miR-28 on the survival of cardiomyocytes. We show that miR-28 was upregulated in cardiomyocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). MiR-28 gain of function sensitized cell apoptosis, whereas miR-28 loss of function partially rescued cell apoptosis induced by H2O2. Importantly, we observed a significant reduction in Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activity after miR-28 treatment. Luciferase activity assay and western blot analysis both revealed that, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), which is critical for Akt activation, was directly and negatively modulated by miR-28. Our results therefore indicate that miR-28 regulates oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis in heart muscle cells, which possibly involves a PDK1/Akt/mTOR-dependent mechanism. MIR-28 could serve as a critical therapeutic target to diminish oxidative stress-induced cell death in the heart.
