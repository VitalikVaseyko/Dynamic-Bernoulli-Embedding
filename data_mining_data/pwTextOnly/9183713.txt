The presence of 14 enzymes was investigated using purified spores of the microsporidian Nosema grylli from fat body of the crickets Gryllus bimaculatus. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49), phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2), phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), fructose 6-phosphate kinase (EC 2.7.1.11), aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), 3-phosophoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) were detected with activities of 15 +/- 1, 7 +/- 1, 1,549 +/- 255, 10 +/- 1, 5 +/- 1, 16 +/- 4, 6 +/- 1 and 16 +/- 2 nmol/min mg protein, respectively. Hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) and succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.1) were not detectable. These results suggest the catabolism of carbohydrates in microsporidia occurs via the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase may reoxidize NADH which is produced by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in glycolysis.
