Targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice, where an oncogene is placed under the control of the regulatory sequences of a cell-specific gene, has been used to derive several new types of differentiated nonepithelial and epithelial cell lines. This review summarizes the properties of cell lines derived from proximal, distal and collecting duct cells. The cells were obtained from kidneys of transgenic mice harboring the 5' regulatory sequences of the L-type pyruvate kinase or vimentin genes controlling the expression of either the large T and little t antigens or the temperature-sensitive large T antigen.
