The activity of the following enzymes in clinically normal newborn calves was investigated: glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (APh), creatine phosphokinase (CPhK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), leucine-aminopeptidase (LAP), aldolase (A), and cholinesterase (ChE). The studies were carried out at the first hour prior to offering colostrum as well as at the 6th, 12th, 24th hr and on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 10th, 15th, and 20th day following it first intake. Regularly rising values of the enzyme activity up to the 24th hour were observed with APh, GOT, GPT, CPhK, and LAP. The aldolase enzyme (after colostrum had been given for the first time) in all animals showed a statistically significant drop of activity at the 6th hour. The activity of LDH displayed a consistently rising trend up to the end of the experimental period. The cholinesterase activity showed high values immediately following birth, reaching those found in the dams by the end of the observation period.
