We summarize the results of study of the properties of two models of transimmortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells derived from the kidneys of transgenic mice harboring the SV40 large T and little t antigens/L-pyruvate kinase hybrid gene. The two cell lines, referred to as PKSV-PCT and PKSV-PR cells, maintained for long-term passages the main biochemical and functional properties from the convoluted and terminal parts of the proximal tubule, respectively, from which they were derived. In PKSV-PCT cells, gentamicin induced lysosomal alkalinization, decreased the cellular N-acetyl-beta-D-glucuronidase, and stimulated its secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that these models of mouse proximal cultured cells could be suitable models for the study of the cellular action of drugs.
