The allosteric inhibition of M1-type pyruvate kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle by phenylalanine is reciprocally dependent on Mg2+ and phosphoenolpyruvate concentrations. At pH 8, phenylalanine acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to Mg2+ and phosphoenolpyruvate, and vice versa. Phenylalanine introduces sigmoidicity into the dependence of the reaction velocity on [Mg2+]. In vitro kinetic analysis indicates that phenylalanine inhibition of muscle pyruvate kinase is unlikely to have regulatory significance in vivo.
