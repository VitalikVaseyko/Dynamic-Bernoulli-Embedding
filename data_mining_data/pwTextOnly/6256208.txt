It has been shown that ADP, thrombin, calcium, cAMP and cGMP induce changes in platelet metabolism. Aggregation inducers that inhibit the glycolytic enzymes decrease the content of pyruvate and ATP in platelets. The aggregation inhibitor, cAMP increases the activity of pyruvate kinase and the content of pyruvate and ATP in platelets. Cyclic AMP does not affect the activity of pyruvate kinase but raises the level of pyruvate and diminishes the content of ATP in platelets.
