Hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) specific activities were decreased after partial hepatectomy or sham operation. The decreases were more marked and sustained after partial hepatectomy. These activity changes ensure that hepatic carbon flux after partial hepatectomy is predominantly in the direction of gluconeogenesis. The decrease in PK specific activity observed after partial hepatectomy was associated with a decreased PK activation ratio (activity measured at 0.15 mM PEP: activity measured at 5.0 mM PEP), and hepatic concentrations of PEP were increased. The low hepatic PDHa activity observed at the first day after partial hepatectomy occurred concomitantly with an increased fatty acid concentration. PDHa activity increased after inhibition of lipolysis. The results indicate that carbohydrate utilization is unimportant for hepatic energy supply during liver regeneration. There was no evidence that the control of PK or PDH in the regenerative liver after partial hepatectomy differed from that observed in the liver of the unoperated rat.
