To identify proteins associated with esophageal carcinogenesis, we performed protein profiling of 16 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and paired noncancerous tissues by 2-DE and MS/MS. In cancerous tissues, three spots showed significant up-regulation in the amount of protein, while eight spots were significantly down-regulated. The identities of the spots were determined by PMF with LC-MS/MS and were confirmed by immunoblotting. The up-regulated proteins were tropomyosin alpha 4 chain, transgelin, and pyruvate kinase. The down-regulated proteins were serum albumin precursor, isoforms of annexin A1, tropomyosin beta chain, 14-3-3 protein sigma, and isoforms of serotransferrin precursor. In all 16 cases, up-regulation of the tropomyosin alpha 4 chain was confirmed by immunoblotting. Localization of the tropomyosin alpha 4 chain in ESCC cells and adjacent fibroblasts was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
