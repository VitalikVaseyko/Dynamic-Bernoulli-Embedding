We describe an enzyme histochemical multistep technique for the demonstration of pyruvate kinase activity. In this technique, a semipermeable membrane is interposed between the incubation medium and the tissue sections, thus preventing diffusion of the enzyme into the medium during the incubation period. In this histochemical system, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) donates its phosphate group to ADP in a reaction catalysed by pyruvate kinase. Next, exogenous and endogenous hexokinase catalyses the reaction between ATP and D-glucose to yield D-glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. The D-glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized by exogenous and endogenous D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and concomitantly, the generated electrons are transported via NADP+, phenazine methosulphate and menadione to nitro-BT, which is finally precipitated as formazan. Sodium azide and amytal are included to block electron transfer to cytochromes. The method proved to be of value for the qualitative demonstration of pyruvate kinase activity in tissue sections of kidneys, heart muscle and skeletal muscle. For quantitative studies and for investigating the activity of this enzyme in liver sections, the method cannot be recommended.
