The present studies aimed at an analysis of the expression level of genes PKM2 and CAST in Longissimus lumborum [LL] muscle tissue of pigs differing as regards the glycolytic potential [GP] and drip loss [DL] from the LL muscle, with reference to the genetic group. The studies covered a total of 65 pigs: 20 purebred Landrace [L], 22 crossbreeds of Landrace with the Yorkshire [L x Y] and 23 three-breed crosses (Landrace x Yorkshire) x Duroc [(L x Y) x D]. In the case of gene PKM2 one may observe in (L x Y) x D crossbreds, compared to L x Y crossbreds, an increased expression, closely related with the increase in dry matter content, including intramuscular fat, as well as a more favourable progress of glycolytic and energy metabolism during the early time post mortem (pH(45) and R(1)). Compared with Landrace animals, the lower expression of the CAST gene observed in (L x Y) x D pigs is manifested by a marked improvement of meat quality (R(1) pH(45) pH(24), pH(48)), arising from the rate of glycolytic and energy metabolism, typical for normal meat, that in effect results in its higher culinary and technological value.
