In epithelial cells isolated from rat small intestine and incubated in the presence of 1 mM glucose, streptozotocin-induced diabetes reduced, by 46 and 29%, respectively, the rates of both glucose utilization and L-lactate formation. These effects were accompanied by a significant decrease of enterocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration (about 50%) and of the glycolytic flux through the reaction catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase. The diminution of enterocyte fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels caused by diabetes occurred in spite of an increase of hexose 6-phosphate concentration, and was associated with a reduction in the amount of active form of 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase; total activity of this enzyme was not significantly modified. Diabetes also caused an acceleration in the rate of 3-O-methyl-D-(14C) glucose uptake and increased hexokinase activity in enterocytes. Lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase activities were not found to be significantly different in epithelial cells isolated from control or diabetic animals. Our results indicate that a reduction of the glycolytic flux in enterocytes could collaborate to increase intestinal glucose absorption in the diabetic state.
