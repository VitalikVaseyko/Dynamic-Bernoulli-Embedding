Retraction of platelet rich plasma clotted by reptilase is induced by electrical stimulation. Optimal retraction is obtained by stimuli, applied for more than 4 min, with the following characteristics: intensity = 150 volts, duration = 50 msec each, frequency = 10/sec. Electrically induced reptilase clot retraction is shown to be inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, methyl-xanthines, PGE1, acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, but not by apyrase or by phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate kinase and MgCl2. The results indicate that electrical stimulation induces retraction of PRP clotted by reptilase by triggering off an increased availability of Ca2+ in the intracellular space.
