Treatment of 18 h-starved rats with dexamethasone and subsequent isolation and incubation of the hepatocytes in the presence of the steroid increased gluconeogenic flux with both 1.0 mM pyruvate and 1.0 mM lactate plus 0.2 mM pyruvate as the substrate. The magnitude of stimulation was comparable with both substrates. The increase in glucose output was accompanied by an increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase, although the absolute flux and magnitude were considerably less in the presence of the more reduced substrate. The effect of the steroid on the flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase was substrate-dependent, an inhibition occurring with the more oxidized substrate. There was no effect of steroid treatment on [1-14C]lactate or pyruvate oxidation or on tricarboxylic-acid-cycle flux as measured by [3-14C]pyruvate oxidation. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a parallel increase in both pyruvate kinase flux and glucose synthesis with both substrates employed, indicating that the steroid had no effect on the partitioning of phosphoenolpyruvate between pyruvate and lactate formation and gluconeogenesis. Similarly there was no effect of the steroid on either the activity ratio or the total pyruvate kinase activity in the cells. It is suggested that the acute effect of the dexamethasone to increase gluconeogenesis resides at the level of phosphoenolpyruvate formation, i.e. pyruvate carboxylase and possibly phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.
