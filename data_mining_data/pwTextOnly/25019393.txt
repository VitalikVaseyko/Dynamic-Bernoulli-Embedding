High grade glioma (glioblastoma) is the most common brain tumor. Its malignancy makes it the fourth biggest cause of cancer death. In our experiments we used several glioblastoma cell lines generated in our laboratory to obtain proteomics information specific for this disease. This study starts our developing the complete 2DE map of glioblastoma proteins. 2DE separation with following imaging, immunochemistry, spot picking, and mass-spectrometry allowed us detecting and identifying more than 100 proteins. Several of them have prominent differences in their level between norm and cancer. Among them are alpha-enolase (ENOA_HUMAN), pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (KPYM_HUMAN), cofilin 1 (COF1_HUMAN), translationally-controlled tumor protein TCTP_HUMAN, annexin 1 (ANXA1_HUMAN), PCNA (PCNA_HUMAN), p53 (TP53_HUMAN) and others. Most interesting results were obtained with protein p53. In all glioblastoma cell lines, its level was dramatically up regulated and enriched by multiple additional isoforms. This distribution is well correlated with presence of these proteins inside of cells themselves. At this initial step we suggest the panel of specific brain tumor markers (signature) to help creating noninvasive techniques to diagnose disease. These preliminary data point to these proteins as promising markers of glioblastoma.
