Aberrant functionality of the cell cycle has been implicated in the pathology of traumatic SCI. Although it has been reported that the expressions of various cell cycle related proteins were altered significantly following SCI, detailed information on the subject remains largely unclear. The embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is an important metabolic kinase in aerobic glycolysis or the warburg effect, however, its functions in central nervous system (CNS) injury remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that PKM2 was not only significantly upregulated by western blot and immunohistochemistry but certain traumatic stimuli also induced translocation of PKM2 into the nucleus in astrocytes following spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, the expression levels and localization of p-beta-catenin, p27, cyclin D1 and PCNA were correlated with PKM2 after SCI. In vitro, we also found that PKM2 co-immunoprecipitation with p-beta-catenin and p27 respectively. Knockdown of PKM2 apparently decreased the level of PCNA, cyclinD1, p27 in primary astrocyte cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that nuclear translocation of PKM2 promotes astrocytes proliferation after SCI through modulating cell cycle signaling. These discoveries firstly uncovered the role of PKM2 in spinal cord injury and provided a potential therapeutic target for CNS injury and repair.
