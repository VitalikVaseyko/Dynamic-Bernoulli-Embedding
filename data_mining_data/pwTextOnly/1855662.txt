Electrophoretic characters of 9 enzyme systems from different tissue homogenates supposedly controlled by 17 loci are described. Polymorphism detected in loci for glutamate-oxalate transaminase, adenylate kinase, esterase D. glucosephosphate isomerase was thoroughly investigated. Methodic characteristics of enzyme electrophoresis and population-genetic characters of the species studied are under discussion.
