OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical significance of blood and fecal expression of tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (Tumor M2-PK) in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: With 22 healthy subjects as controls, 44 patients with CRC were examined for tumor M2-PK in serum and fecal samples using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The sensitivity of serum and fecal tumor M2-PK for detecting CRC was 59.1% and 63.6% with a specificity of 86.4% and 81.8%, respectively. The serum and fecal levels of tumor M2-PK showed a significant correlation in CRC patients. CONCLUSION: Tumor M2-PK has good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of CRC.
