Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from aggregating Dictyostelium discoideum cells has been purified to homogeneity. It has a monomeric molecular weight of 66kD and is tetrameric in low ionic strength buffers. The enzyme is not regulated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or by alanine and appears to resemble the M1 isoenzyme from rat liver most closely, although its activity is not inhibited by ATP.
