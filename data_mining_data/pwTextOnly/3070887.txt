Hemoglobin affinity to oxygen, enzyme activity and metabolite concentration of carbohydrate metabolism were determined in erythrocytes of rats which were administered insulin solution. A valid decrease of the hemoglobin value P50 (pressure of hemoglobin half-saturation with oxygen), as well as a decrease of the enzyme activity of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate shunt and increase of the activity of regulatory glycolysis enzymes--hexokinase and pyruvate kinase in erythrocytes with multiple introduction of hormones to animals have been established. Such changes in rat erythrocytes were registered with the simultaneous effect of insulin and hypoxic hypoxia evoked by the "lift" of rats in the altitude chamber to the conditional altitude of 9000 m. It is found out that preliminary injection of insulin considerably increases survivability of rats under hypoxic hypoxia at great altitudes.
