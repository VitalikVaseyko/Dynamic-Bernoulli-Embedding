A 4-year-old girl with pyruvate kinase deficiency underwent partial splenic embolization initially. However, even after this procedure, she still had to be transfused every 2 months and then every month. At 5 years of age, she was admitted to our hospital to undergo splenectomy. She underwent laparoscopic splenectomy and concomitant cholecystectomy for gallstones. The hemogram recovered to the normal range after surgery, and her postoperative course was uneventful. Considering the absence of morbidity, the short hospitalization, the quick return to normal activity, the good cosmetic result, and the improved clinical and hematologic results, we consider that simultaneous laparoscopic splenectomy and cholecystectomy is safe and effective for the management of hemolytic anemia resulting from pyruvatre kinase deficiency and associated with cholelithiasis.
