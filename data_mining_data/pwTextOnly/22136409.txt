Flooding injury is a major problem in soybean cultivation. A proteomics approach was used to clarify the occurrence of changes in protein expression level and phosphorylation in soybeans under flooding stress. Two-day-old seedlings were flooded for 1 day, proteins were extracted from root tips of the seedlings and digested with trypsin, and their expression levels and phosphorylation states were compared to those of untreated controls using mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques. Phosphoproteins were enriched using a phosphoprotein purification column prior to digestion and mass spectrometry. The expression of proteins involved in energy production increased as a result of flooding, while expression of proteins involved in protein folding and cell structure maintenance decreased. Flooding induced changes of phosphorylation status of proteins involved in energy generation, protein synthesis and cell structure maintenance. The response to flooding stress may be regulated by both modulation of protein expression and phosphorylation state. Energy-demanding and production-related metabolic pathways may be particularly subject to regulation by changes in protein phosphorylation during flooding.
