Mouse transplanted tumors, in contrast to normal tissues, contain a pyruvate kinase (PK) variant sensitive to the inhibitory action of L-cysteine and less sensitive to saturated fatty acids than the normal enzyme. In selected normal and tumor materials two fractions of PK were separated. Fraction A (20-30% (NH4)2SO4 saturation) dominated in normal liver, and fraction B (50-60% (NH4)2SO4 saturation) in skeletal muscles and Ehrlich ascites tumor. Only this fraction B from tumor material was sensitive to L-cysteine, and seems to contain a tumor-specific PK variant which might be considered as a marker of neoplastic transformation in a broad spectrum of mouse experimental tumors.
