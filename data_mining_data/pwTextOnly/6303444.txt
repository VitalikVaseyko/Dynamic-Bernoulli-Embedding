cdc 19.1 is a temperature-sensitive lesion in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The phenotype of this mutant is a cell cycle specific arrest in G1, which is expressed at 37 degrees C. In the present study, 31P- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the metabolism of the mutant at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. Our results confirm previous findings which have indicated that cdc 19.1 contains temperature-sensitive pyruvate kinase activity. In contrast to previous findings, however, the present investigation demonstrates that restriction of pyruvate kinase activity in vivo takes as long as 24 h to be fully expressed. In addition, analysis by NMR has allowed us to assess the metabolic consequences of pyruvate kinase restriction which may contribute to the arrest of cell growth in the early G1 phase of the cell division cycle.
