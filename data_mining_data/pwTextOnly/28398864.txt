Muscle pyruvate kinase (PYK) activity was established as a biochemical indicator of temperature attained during cooking in both a model system and a commercial-type pullman-style canned cured pork product. Water extract (model system) or pressed-out meat juice (commercial-type pullman-style canned cured pork) was incubated (37 degrees C up to 40 min) with reagent containing adenosine diphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvic acid and NADH. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) necessary for the reaction is provided by the muscle extract or meat juice. When muscle PYK activity is present, NADH is oxidized resulting in a loss of fluorescence (reaction mixture spots on filter paper viewed under long-wave ultraviolet light). Model system results showed high PYK activity (no fluorescence) remained in samples heated to 67.7 degrees C. PYK activity progressively declined in samples heated to 68.3 degrees C and 68.9 degrees C. No PYK activity was detected in samples heated to 69.5 degrees C or 70 degrees C. Canned product attaining a core temperature of 62.9 degrees C had high PYK activity. PYK activity progressively declined in product heated to 65.6 degrees C and 68.6 degrees C. Essentially no PYK activity was detected from product processed to 69.9 degrees C.
