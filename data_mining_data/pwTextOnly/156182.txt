Kinetic evidence of a time- and dose-dependent inactivation of phosphofructokinase by glucagon in isolated rat hepatocytes is reported. This inactivation, which persists after gel filtration of a cell-free extract on Sephadex G-25 and after 400-fold purification of the enzyme on agarose-ATP, is observed when the enzyme activity is measured at subsaturating concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate, while there is no change in Vmax. Phosphofructokinase inactivation by glucagon parallels the known inactivation of pyruvate kinase L and activation of glycogen phosphorylase alpha. Exogenous cyclic AMP mimics the effect of this hormone. Half-maximal effect for both phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase L is caused by a similar dose of glucagon (1 x 10(-10) M). The inactivation of phosphofructokinase by nonsaturating concentration of glucagon is reversed spontaneously within 40 min of incubation and this reversion is accelerated by insulin.
