Half-site editing is an in vitro mutagenesis procedure designed for use in making precise plasmid constructions. Like many in vitro mutagenesis techniques, this procedure involves hybridization of a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer to single-stranded template DNA followed by polymerization with DNA polymerase I (Klenow). Half-site editing differs from other techniques in two main ways. First, T4 DNA polymerase treatment truncates the target DNA at a point determined by the primer and repairs any mismatches to the sequence specified by the primer. Second, a blunt-end ligation step is included. This ligation exploits the symmetry inherent in most restriction sites to create a desired restriction site at the truncated end of the target DNA fragment. Half-site editing has been used to place ClaI restriction sites at the 3' end of the yeast pyruvate kinase promoter and at two positions at the 5' end of the yeast acetolactate synthase coding sequence.
