BACKGROUND: Cancer cells, even in the presence of available oxygen, have a glycolysis enhancement. The "aerobic glycolysis" is known as the Warburg effect and it is considered one of the fundamental hallmarks of metabolic alteration during malignant transformation. A feature of many tumors is also a change into ions equilibrium, with particular reference to K(+) intracellular concentration. Another hallmark in cancer is the reprogrammed chemotaxis pathways in favour of tumor cell dissemination. RESULTS: The doubling population time of 5 mM K:D-rib treated Hs 578T (HTB-126 (R) ATCC) cell line is reduce by 30% respect to the control. During the chemotactic invasion assay, the relative number of motile and invasive cells, counted inside the FBS-AGAR spot, shows a decrease with the maintenance of the treatment reaching the 25% after nine days. Hs 578Bst (HTB-125 (R) ATCC) non-tumor cell line treated for nineteen days with 5 mM K:D-rib was split twice as well as the control. No morphological change was visible in the treated respect to untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the synergic action of potassium bicarbonate and D-ribose has effect on Hs 578T cancer cell line proliferation reducing the cell cycle time. At 5 mM concentration, K:D-rib is able to modify the tumorigenic potential of human breast cancer cell line Hs 578T, interfering in vitro with the capability of Hs 578 T cell line to migrate under chemotactic stimuli. Despite this, K:D-rib solution, does not exhibit any appreciable toxicity as confirmed by the proliferation assay accomplished on Hs 578Bst cell line.
