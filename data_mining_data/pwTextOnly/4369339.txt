A new method is described for the preparation of pyruvate kinase from yeast. This eliminates proteolysis during the preparation. The molecular weight of yeast pyruvate kinase is 215000, and it is composed of four subunits. Such properties of the enzyme as its extinction coefficient, cold-lability, thiol-group reactivity and binding of Mn(2+) ions are compared with those previously reported for yeast pyruvate kinase prepared by different methods. The specific activity is significantly higher than previously observed, but otherwise the enzyme is similar, apart from its molecular weight and Mn(2+)-binding characteristics, to preparations from Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained in this laboratory (e.g. Fell et al., 1972, and references therein) and that of C. H. Suelter (e.g. Kuczenski & Suelter, 1971, and references therein), and is different from the enzyme isolated from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis by B. Hess and his co-workers (e.g. Wieker & Hess, 1972, and references therein).
