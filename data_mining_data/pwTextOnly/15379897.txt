Neurons are highly vulnerable to ischemic/hypoxic stress, while glial cells show tolerance to such stress. However, the mechanisms for tolerance acquisition in glial cells have yet to be established. We attempted to isolate and identify a stress protein that is upregulated in response to hypoxia in human astrocytoma CCF-STTG1 cells. In particular, pyruvate kinase (PK) was upregulated by hypoxia in CCF-STTG1 cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), the primary transcription factor that is responsible for multiple gene activation under hypoxia, plays a critical role in PK expression during hypoxic challenge. To determine whether newly synthesized PK is involved in tolerance to hypoxic stress, we established the PK-overexpressing neuronal cells. Overexpression of the wild-type, but not the kinase-negative mutant, resulted in attenuation of the loss of cell viability and the typical apoptotic features by hypoxia or oxidative stress in SK-N-MC cells. These findings suggest that upregulation of PK may result in acquisition of tolerance against hypoxic stress, and that the antioxidant effect may be involved in the protective effect of PK.
