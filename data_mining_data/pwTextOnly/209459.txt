The 2-[18O]phosphorothioate of D-glycerate, chiral at phosphorus, was prepared. The chiral phosphoryl group was transferred enzymically to ADP [by using enolase and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.40)] resulting in the synthesis of adenosine 5'-O-([gamma-18O],gamma-thio)triphosphate. This labeled ATP was used as a thiophosphoryl group donor in the reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase (ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.30) and by hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.1). The product from the latter (glucose 6-phosphorothioate) was converted enzymically into glycerol phosphorothioate. Determination of the relative configurations and diastereoisomeric purities of the samples of glycerol phosphorothioate demonstrates that all three phosphokinases (pyruvate kinase, glycerol kinase, and hexokinase) transfer the thiophosphoryl group with complete stereospecificity, and further shows that these reactions follow an identical stereochemical course.
