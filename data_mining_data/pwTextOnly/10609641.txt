Two members of the ATP-dependent class of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases (PEPCKs) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens) have been comparatively studied with regard to their oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase and pyruvate kinase-like activities. The pyruvate kinase-like activities were dependent on the presence of Mn2+; at the same concentrations Mg2+ was not effective. These activities were synergistically activated by a combination of both metal ions. Vmax for these activities in A. succiniciproducens and S. cerevisiae PEPCKs was 0.13% and 1.2% that of the principal reaction, respectively. The OAA decarboxylase activity was nucleotide independent and, with decreasing order of effectiveness, these activities were supported by Mn2+ and Mg2+. AMP is an activator of these reactions. Vmax for the OAA decarboxylase activities in A. succiniciproducens and S. cerevisiae PEPCKs was 4% and 0.2% that of the PEP-forming reaction, respectively.
