1. An assay method for the determination of phosphopyruvate carboxylase activity is described in which improved sensitivity is obtained by separation of the enzyme from interfering pyruvate kinase by zone sedimentation. 2. The molecular weight of rat liver phosphopyruvate carboxylase determined by zone sedimentation is about 68000. 3. Premature delivery of rat foetuses by uterine section results in the rapid appearance of phosphopyruvate carboxylase, but hexose diphosphatase and pyruvate carboxylase, already present in the foetal rat liver, are not significantly affected, and glucose 6-phosphatase activity is only slightly affected. 4. The rate of incorporation of [(14)C]pyruvate into glucose by liver slices is also greatly increased by premature delivery and there is a highly significant linear correlation between this process and the phosphopyruvate carboxylase activity.
