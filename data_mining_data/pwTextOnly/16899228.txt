Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) not only induce the redistribution of cytosolic PKC to various subcellular compartments but also activate the kinase domain of the protein. In the present study we have investigated the nature of mitochondrial PKC pool and its effects on mitochondrial function in cells treated with PMA. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts, C6 glioma and COS7 cells with PMA resulted in a dramatic redistribution of intracellular PKCalpha pool, with large fraction of the protein pool sequestered in the mitochondrial compartment. We also observed mitochondrial PKCdelta accumulation in a cell restricted manner. The intramitochondrial localization was ascertained by using a combination of protection against protease treatment of isolated mitochondria and immunofluorescence microscopy. PMA-induced mitochondrial localization of PKCalpha was accompanied by increased mitochondrial PKC activity, altered cell morphology, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities, and increased mitochondrial ROS production. All of these changes could be retarded by treatment with PKC inhibitors. These results show a direct role for PMA-mediated PKCalpha translocation to mitochondria in inducing mitochondrial toxicity.
