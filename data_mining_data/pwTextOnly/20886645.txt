This study aimed to increase the glycolytic flux of the multivitamin auxotrophic yeast Torulopsis glabrata by redirecting NADH oxidation from oxidative phosphorylation to membrane-bound ferric reductase. We added potassium ferricyanide as electron acceptor to T. glabrata culture broth at 20% dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, which resulted in: (1) decreases in the NADH content, NADH/NAD(+) ratio, and ATP level of 45.3%, 60.3%, and 15.2%, respectively; (2) high activities of the key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, as well as high expression levels of the genes encoding these enzymes; and (3) increases in the specific glucose consumption rate and pyruvate yield of T. glabrata was by 45.5% and 23.1%, respectively. Our results showed that membrane-bound ferric reductase offers an alternative and efficient NADH oxidation pathway at lower DO concentration, which increases the glycolytic flux of T. glabrata.
