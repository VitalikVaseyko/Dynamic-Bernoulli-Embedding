We present the results of screening for pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency on a cohort of 146 patients pre-selected from 4017 individuals by hematological index analysis. On average the PK activity levels measured in this cohort study were about 1.9% IU/g Hb while the activity measured in 85 healthy adults with normal erythrocyte indexes was in the range of 3.9-9.8 IU/g Hb. We were able to define 14 different mutations in the coding sequence of the R-PK gene in 74 individuals with low enzyme activity. The most common were the G1168A and G1529A mutations at exon 11 occurring in 54% of the cases. Other mutations occurring more than once were C1492T, C1456T, G1291A, C1594T, G787A, G994A, and G1010C. The polymorphism at nt 1705 was in linkage disequilibrium with the A and C polymorphism, which indicated a multi-centric origin of the mutation. Further study of the promoter region and intron/exon boundary is under investigation.
