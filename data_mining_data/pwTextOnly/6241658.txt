The effects of Cu2+ on glycolysis and several glycolytic enzymes were studied in rat brain extracts in vitro. At concentrations reportedly found in Wilson's disease, Cu2+ significantly inhibited lactate production from glucose or glucose-6-phosphate in rat brain postnuclear supernatant with an IC50 of about 3 microM. Cu2+ also inhibited several glycolytic enzymes. Amongst the latter, Cu2+ was most effective in inhibiting hexokinase (IC50 for Cu2+ = 7 microM), moderately effective in inhibiting pyruvate kinase (IC50 for Cu2+ = 56 microM), but least effective in inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (IC50 for Cu2+ = 300 microM). These results suggest that inhibition of brain glycolysis may have pathophysiological importance in copper poisoning and in Wilson's disease.
