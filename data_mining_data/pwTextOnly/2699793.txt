In anaerobically grown yeast cells which lack functional mitochondria, the presence of diethylstilbestrol (DES) depressed glycolysis. The addition of the inhibitor markedly increased the cellular concentration of glycolytic intermediates which are formed prior to the pyruvate kinase step as well as to bring about an increase in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. Under these conditions an 18 fold decrease in the mass action ratio for pyruvate kinase [( pyruvate] [ATP]/[phosphoenolpyruvate] [ADP]) was noted, however, there was little if any effect on the other glycolytic enzymes. These results suggest that the depression of anaerobic glycolysis caused by DES results from a blockage at the level of the regulatory enzyme pyruvate kinase through a modification of its intracellular environment.
