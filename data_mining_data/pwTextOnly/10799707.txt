We investigated the skeletal muscles of nine strains of senescence accelerated mouse (SAM), DDD, AKR/J, C57BL/6J, A/J and BALB/c mice. We found that male SAMP8, SAMP7, C57BL/6J, A/J and BALB/c mice expressed tubular aggregates (TAs) in their skeletal muscle. Among these strains, the SAMP8 strain, which exhibits a short life span and various age-associated neurodegenerative disorders plus mitochondrial dysfunction, showed TAs more markedly than the others. Thus, we compared SAMP8 mice against SAMR1 mice, an accelerated senescence-resistant strain. Light- and electron micrographs showed that male SAMP8 mice exhibited an age-dependent aggravation of TA accumulation. There were no significant differences in the serum lactate/pyruvate levels between the SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. However, the serum creatine kinase (CK) levels of the 3 and 6-month-old SAMP8 mice were higher than that of the corresponding SAMR1 mice. Considering the serum CK levels and the mitochondrial dysfunction of SAMP8 mice, we conclude that the TAs may be involved in the homeostasis of energy metabolism that is not appropriately regulated in the SAMP8 mouse mitochondrion.
