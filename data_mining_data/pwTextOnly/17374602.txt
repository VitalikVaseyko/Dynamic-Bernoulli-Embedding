The utility of differentially expressed proteins discovered and identified in an earlier study (DeSouza, L., Diehl, G., Rodrigues, M. J., Guo, J., Romaschin, A. D., Colgan, T. J., and Siu, K. W. M. (2005) Search for cancer markers from endometrial tissues using differentially labeled tags iTRAQ and cleavable ICAT with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. J. Proteome Res. 4, 377-386) to discriminate malignant and benign endometrial tissue samples was verified in a 40-sample iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) labeling study involving normal proliferative and secretory samples and Types I and II endometrial cancer samples. None of these proteins had the sensitivity and specificity to be used individually to discriminate between normal and cancer samples. However, a panel of pyruvate kinase, chaperonin 10, and alpha1-antitrypsin achieved the best results with a sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and positive predictive value of 0.95 each in a logistic regression analysis. In addition, three new potential markers were discovered, whereas two other proteins showed promising trends but were not detected in sufficient numbers of samples to permit statistical validation. Differential expressions of some of these candidate biomarkers were independently verified using immunohistochemistry.
