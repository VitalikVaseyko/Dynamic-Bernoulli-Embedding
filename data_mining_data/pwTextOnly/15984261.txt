This paper presents dielectric properties of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) under an ac electric field. Using a Hg-SAM/SAM-Hg junction, we measured the ac impedance of alkanethiol SAMs using a sinusoidal perturbation of 30 mV (peak-to-peak) with frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz at zero bias. Semicircles at higher frequencies and at middle frequencies along with Warburg lines at lower frequencies were observed in complex plane impedance plots, that is, Nyquist plots. The frequency response of SAMs was analyzed by modeling the junction using an equivalent circuit and fitting the Nyquist plots. The semicircles at higher frequencies are attributed to the effect of the SAM/SAM interfaces, and the ones at middle frequencies are attributed to the effect of alkanethiol SAMs. The comparison in the plots of the imaginary part of the impedance Z against frequency for the bare Hg electrodes (in pure ethanal) and the SAM-covered Hg electrodes (in alkanethiol solution) supports the analysis. The Warburg lines are attributed to a certain ionic impurity. The dielectric loss spectra are further analyzed. Chain-length-dependent peaks, which correspond to different relaxation mechanisms, at higher frequencies and middle frequencies were observed in the spectra of the dissipation factor (tan delta vs frequency). The peaks move to small frequency with the increase of chain length of alkanethiols. Using a correlation of peak position with the chain length, we then derived active energies of 39-99 meV for alkanethiol SAMs of C7-C18 under an ac electric field.
