The assay of triglycerides by an entirely enzymatic pathway was adapted for use on the GSA II Greiner. The method requires only 20 microliters of biological material. The reaction time is short: 8 min at 37 degrees C. The coefficient of variation does not exceed 6% over a period of one month. Linearity of the measurements was verified up to a level of 4 mmol/l. It was shown that the free glycerol level should be systematically measured and deducted from that of the total glycerol to assure accurate results. The stability of the plasma triglycerides was investigated as a function of the length and temperature of storage (+4 degrees C and -196 degrees C). The free glycerol increases as a function of time, whereas the level of triglycerides stays constant. Haemoglobin and various medicaments, in particular, hypolipemiants and hypoglycemiants, did not interfere.
