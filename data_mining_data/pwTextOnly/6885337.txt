In man, patients with hereditary red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency have their enzyme concomitantly affected in both red cells and liver (PK-L), such that red cell L' and liver L PK subunits appear to be encoded by the same structural gene. Very recently, a mutant M1 PK has been described in muscle from a special mouse strain in which the M2 PK was concomitantly modified. Thus, it has been suggested that the M1 and M2 PK subunits are also encoded by the same structural gene, a gene distinct from that encoding L' and L. In this paper, we show that synthesis of each of the four PK subunits is specified by a different specific mRNA. Two structural genes, but at least four different mRNAs seem therefore to control synthesis of the PK isozymes. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for generation of this diversity at the RNA level are discussed. In addition to these mechanisms of PK diversity, some PK subunits can be modified by post-translational events. In red cells, for instance, cell aging is associated with a progressive, partial proteolysis of the C-terminal extremities of L' subunits, ultimately resulting in cleavage of the phosphorylatable site.
