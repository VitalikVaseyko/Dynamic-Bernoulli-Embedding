Hepatocytes prepared from rats treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 3h and maintained in the presence of 10 microM-dexamethasone in the preparation and incubation buffers showed significantly elevated rates of gluconeogenesis compared with those prepared from control animals. Dexamethasone treatment also increased the sensitivity of the cells to glucagon and the catecholamines. Analysis of the concentrations of metabolites in the gluconeogenic pathway indicated that dexamethasone decreased the intracellular concentration of pyruvate and increased those of phosphoenolpyruvate, acetyl-CoA and citrate, suggesting a stimulation of the reaction(s) converting pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate. This was substantiated by analysis of the pattern of metabolites found in the mitochondrial compartment after digitonin fractionation of the cells. Inclusion of 3-mercaptopicolinate in the incubation enhanced the effect of the hormone on the distribution of metabolites. Thus, in the absence of an effect of the steroid at the level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or pyruvate kinase, dexamethasone treatment still increased the formation of malate, aspartate and citrate from pyruvate, indicating a stimulation in the intact cell of pyruvate carboxylase. It is suggested that the stimulation of pyruvate carboxylase is a result of a general activation of mitochondrial function, with an increase in the intramitochondrial concentrations of acetyl-CoA and ATP, a decrease in glutamate and an enhanced intramitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio.
