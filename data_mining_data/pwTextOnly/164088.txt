5-Acetyl-4-methyl-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-imidazole-5'-phosphate reacts with diphenylphospho chloridate forming the asymmetrical pyrophosphate ester. This in turn reacts with tri-n-butyl-ammonium phosphate yielding 5-acetyl-4-methyl-imidazole-riboside-5'-diphosphate and with tri-n-butylammonium pyrophosphate to give the nucleotide triphosphate. 5-Acetyl-4-methyl-imidazole-riboside-5'-pyrophosphate shows in the test with pyruvate kinase a reaction rate three times slower than that of ADP; but the same Km as that of ADP. The ATP analogue is only about 10% as effective as ATP itself in the test with hexokinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase and gloconate kinase. Adenylate kinase and NAD" kinase show no activity when ATP is replaced by the nucleotide-triphosphate-analogue. In presence of ATP the analogue strongly inhibits the reaction of adenylate kinase.
