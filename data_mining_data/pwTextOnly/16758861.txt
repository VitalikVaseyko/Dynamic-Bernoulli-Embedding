This work is concerned with the metabolism of Caldithrix abyssi-an anaerobic, moderately thermophilic bacterium isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and representing a new, deeply deviated branch within the domain Bacteria. Cells of C. abyssi grown on acetate and nitrate, which was reduced to ammonium, possessed nitrate reductase activity and contained cytochromes of the b and c types. Utilization of acetate occurred as a result of the operation of the TCA and glyoxylate cycles. During growth of C. abyssi on yeast extract, fermentation with the formation of acetate, propionate, hydrogen, and CO2 occurred. In extracts of cells grown on yeast extract, acetate was produced from pyruvate with the involvement of the following enzymes: pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (2.6 micromol/(min mg protein)), phosphate acetyltransferase (0.46 micromol/(min mg protein)), and acetate kinase (0.3 micromol/(min mg protein)). The activity of fumarate reductase (0.14 micromol/(min mg protein)), malate dehydrogenase (0.17 micromol/(min mg protein)), and fumarate hydratase (1.2 micromol/(min mg protein)), as well as the presence of cytochrome b, points to the formation of propionate via the methyl-malonyl-CoA pathway. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) was detected. Thus, enzymatic mechanisms have been elucidated that allow C. abyssi to switch from fermentation to anaerobic respiration and to exist in the gradient of redox conditions characteristic of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
