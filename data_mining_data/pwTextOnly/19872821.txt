The temperature characteristic for the rate of O(2) consumption by Chlorella pyrenoidosa suspended in Knop solution containing 1 per cent glucose was studied between 1 degrees and 27 degrees C. with the Warburg technic. The value of micro was found to be about 19,000 +/-1,000 cal. There is some indication of a critical temperature at 20 degrees C., with shift to a lower micro above this temperature. The effect of sudden changes in temperature on the rate of respiration and the variation of the latter with time at constant temperatures are discussed. It is concluded that the "normal" respiration (in absence of external glucose) does not appear in the determination of this temperature characteristic.
