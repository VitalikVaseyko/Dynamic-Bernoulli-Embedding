The European eel is a panmictic species, whose decline has been recorded since the last 30 years. Among human-induced environmental factors of decline, the impact of water dams during species migration is questioned. Indeed, water impoundments can be a severe obstacle for young eels trying to reach the upstream freshwater zones, even if they are equipped with fish-friendly passes. The passage by such devices could be an important event shaping the outcome of the future life and life history traits of eels. We studied what phenotypic traits were associated with the event of experience of passage by water obstacles. We analyzed specific enzyme activities and/or gene transcription levels in the muscle and brain to test whether the obstacle passage is rather a physical or cognitive task. We found that after a long period of maintenance under homogenous conditions, transcription levels of several genes linked to synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and thyroid activity differed among the field-experience groups. In contrast, muscle gene transcription levels or enzymatic activities did not show any differences among fish groups. We suggest that cognitive processes such as learning and memory acquisition rather than swimming-related metabolic capacities are involved in passage of water obstacles by young eels.
