The influence of myofibrillar creatine kinase on the myosin-ATPase activity was examined in cardiac ventricular myofibrils isolated from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and freshwater turtle (Trachemys scripta). The ATPase rate was assessed by recording the rephosphorylation of ADP by the pyruvate kinase reaction alone or together with the amount of creatine formed, when myofibrillar bound creatine kinase was activated with phosphocreatine. The steady-state concentration of ADP in the solution was varied through the activity of pyruvate kinase added to the solution. For rainbow trout myofibrils at a high pyruvate kinase activity, creatine kinase competed for ADP but did not influence the total ATPase activity. When the ADP concentration was elevated within the physiological range by lowering the pyruvate kinase activity, creatine kinase competed efficiently and increased the ATPase activity twice or more for both trout and turtle. As examined for trout myofibrils, the ATPase activity was reduced about four times by inhibiting the activity of myofibril-bound creatine kinase with iodoacetamide and this reduction was only partially counteracted, when the creatine kinase activity was restored by adding creatine kinase to the solution. Hence, the results suggest that myofibril-bound creatine kinase is needed to fully activate the myosin-ATPase activity in hearts from ectothermic vertebrates despite their low energy turn-over relative to endothermic species.
