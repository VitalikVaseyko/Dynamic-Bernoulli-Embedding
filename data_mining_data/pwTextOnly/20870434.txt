Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most frequent red cell enzymatic defect responsible for hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. The clinical picture is quite variable and the reasons of this variability have been only partially clarified. We report the clinical description and the extended molecular analysis in 3 PK deficient patients with clinical phenotype of variable severity. We studied the clinical and hematological aspects of 3 patients and analyzed the following genes: pyruvate kinase-R, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, alpha-globin, uridindiphosphoglucuronil transferase and HFE. One patient (A) with a severe clinical picture resulted homozygote for exon 8 nt994A substitution, the other 2 (brothers) were compound heterozygotes for exon 8 nt994A and exon 11 nt1456T mutation. One of the two brothers with a more severe phenotype coinherited also had G6PD deficiency, while both had microcytosis due to the homozygosity for the non-deletional form of alpha-thalassemia ATG-->ACG substitution at the initiation codon of the alpha2 globin gene. Our results suggest that extended molecular analysis is useful for studying how several interacting gene mutations contribute to the clinical variability of pyruvate kinase deficiency.
