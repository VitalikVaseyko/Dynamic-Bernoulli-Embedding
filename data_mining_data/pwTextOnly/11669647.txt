Yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) is regulated by intermediates of the glycolytic pathway [e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), and citrate] and by the ATP charge of the cell. Recent kinetic and thermodynamic data with Mn(2+)-activated YPK show that Mn(2+) mediates the allosteric communication between the substrate, PEP, and the allosteric effector, FBP [Mesecar, A., and Nowak, T. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 6792, 6803]. These results indicate that divalent cations modulate multiligand interactions, and hence cooperativity with YPK. The nature of multiligand interactions on YPK was investigated in the presence of the physiological divalent activator Mg(2+). The binding interactions of PEP, Mg(2+), and FBP were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding data were subject to thermodynamic linked-function analysis to determine the magnitudes of the multiligand interactions governing the allosteric activation of YPK. The two ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mg(2+), PEP and FBP, and FBP and Mg(2+) are 0.88, -0.38, and -0.75 kcal/mol, respectively. The two-ligand coupling free energies between PEP and Mn(2+) and FBP and Mn(2+) are more negative than those with Mg(2+) as the cation. This indicates that the interactions between the divalent cation and PEP with YPK are different for Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) and that the interaction is not simply electrostatic in nature, as originally hypothesized. The magnitude of the heterotropic interaction between the metal and FBP is similar with Mg(2+) and Mn(2+). The simultaneous binding of Mg(2+), PEP, and FBP to YPK is favored by 3.21 kcal/mol compared to independent binding. This complex is destabilized by 3.30 kcal/mol relative to the analogous YPK-Mn(2+)-PEP-FDP complex. Interpretation of K(d) values when cooperative binding occurs must be done with care as these are not simple thermodynamic constants. These data demonstrate that the divalent metal, which activates phosphoryl transfer in YPK, plays a key role in modulating the various multiligand interactions that define the overall allosteric properties of the enzyme.
