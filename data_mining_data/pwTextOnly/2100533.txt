Albino rats Wistar family raised in normobaric hypoxic environment (10% O2 in N2) since one or two generations showed an increase in arterial blood creatine-kinase, glutamate-dehydrogenase, lactic-dehydrogenase, lactate and pyruvate when compared with normoxic controls. Moreover the values found in hypoxic rats of second generation were intermediate between those found in hypoxic rats of first generation and normoxic controls. These differences are probably due to an improved efficiency of the processes of cellular adaptation to the hypoxic environment when named species remain in hypoxic environment for more than one generation.
