Addition of NH(4) (+) to the photosynthesizing leaf cells of Dolichos lab lab L. var. Lignosis Prain and leaf discs of Vigna sinensis L. savi ex Hassk caused a significant increase in the flow of photosynthetic carbon toward amino acids with a concomitant decrease toward sugars without affecting the over-all photosynthetic rate. Similar diversion of photosynthetic carbon away from sugars was also observed in the photosynthesizing isolated chloroplasts of V. sinensis, but the latter differed in that they accumulated organic acids rather than amino acids. In an effort to understand the mechanism of NH(4) (+)-mediated regulation, the specific and total activities of NAD(P)-glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, pyruvate kinase, alkaline fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and NAD(P)-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of the cells of D. lab lab were checked but none was affected by the added ammonium salts even after prolonged incubation. At certain concentrations, ammonium ions abolished the light activation of NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alkaline fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase in isolated chloroplasts from dark-adapted Vigna leaves without interfering with the basal dark activity of these enzymes. Based on these observations, a possible mechanism of action of NH(4) (+) in regulating the photosynthetic carbon flow is postulated.
