Hepatocytes isolated from the livers of fed rats were used for a comparative study of the effects of phenylephrine, vasopressin and glucagon on gluconeogenesis and on enzymes of glycogen metabolism. When hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of Ca(2+), phenylephrine stimulated gluconeogenesis from pyruvate less than did glucagon, but, in contrast with this hormone, it did not affect the activities of protein kinase and pyruvate kinase, nor the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate, and it did not decrease the release of (3)H(2)O from [6-(3)H]glucose. The effects of vasopressin were similar to those of phenylephrine. Gluconeogenesis from fructose was also stimulated by phenylephrine and, more markedly, by glucagon at the expense of the conversion of fructose into lactate. Insulin was able to antagonize the stimulatory effect of phenylephrine on gluconeogenesis from pyruvate. When Ca(2+) was removed from the incubation medium, phenylephrine still stimulated gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, but it also caused an activation of protein kinase and an inactivation of pyruvate kinase; accordingly, the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate was increased, and, in contrast, vasopressin had no effect on all these parameters. The property of phenylephrine to cause the activation of glycogen phosphorylase was decreased by glucose or by the absence of Ca(2+); it was abolished when these two conditions were combined. Glycogen synthase was inactivated by phenylephrine in the presence or the absence of Ca(2+), although presumably by different mechanisms.
