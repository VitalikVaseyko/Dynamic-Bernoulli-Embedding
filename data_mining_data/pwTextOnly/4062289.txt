The oxidative decarboxylation and subsequent production of glucose from alpha-ketobutyrate were studied using perfused livers from fasted rats. The production of 14CO2 from alpha-keto-[1-14C]butyrate increased monotonically while the production of glucose from alpha-ketobutyrate was biphasic as the perfusate concentration of alpha-ketobutyrate was increased. The biphasic gluconeogenic response using alpha-ketobutyrate as the gluconeogenic precursor was similar to that observed with propionate. The decarboxylation of alpha-ketobutyrate was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the effects of the monocarboxylate transport inhibitor, alpha-cyanocinnamate. Infusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate caused a substantial inhibition of alpha-ketobutyrate decarboxylation while dichloroacetate, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, did not stimulate the metabolism of alpha-ketobutyrate but was inhibitory. The effects of alpha-ketobutyrate infusion on pyruvate decarboxylation were tested and it was found that at low perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 0.25 mM) increasing alpha-ketobutyrate led to increasing inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation, while at high perfusate pyruvate concentrations (ca. 2.5 mM) an initial inhibition was apparent which did not increase substantially with increasing alpha-ketobutyrate concentrations. The results obtained indicate that the regulation of alpha-ketobutyrate metabolism by oxidative decarboxylation differs significantly from that of pyruvate. In addition, while the rate of gluconeogenesis using alpha-ketobutyrate as a precursor was remarkably similar to that using propionate as a gluconeogenic precursor, the effects of alpha-ketobutyrate on the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate were qualitatively different from the effects of propionate on pyruvate metabolism.
