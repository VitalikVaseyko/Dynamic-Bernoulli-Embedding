The effect of electromagnetic field of millimeter range on biochemical indices of testicles of totally exposed rats at various periods of observation (day 1, 10, 30, 90) was studied. The following functional shifts were revealed: the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities enforced approximately up to 130% on 30th day in comparison with the controls, but in three months (90th day) the activity returned to normal values: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase an puruvate kinase did not show obvious changes of activities. On the contrary, there were surprising differences in behavior of androgen-receptor system: the number of androgen-receptor sites in cytosol was increased significantly on 1st day after exposure (114%); on 10th day concentration of RA was quite oppositely 1.68-fold reduced in relation to the control; through 1-month after exposure the rising of [RA] (123%) was registered; however, to 3-month term the significant fall (1.42 times) of the RA contents in testicular cytosol persisted.
