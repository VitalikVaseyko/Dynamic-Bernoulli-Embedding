Cardiac metabolism following hypothermic potassium cardioplegia with blood as cardioplegia vehicle was studied in two groups of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. In 15 patients, blood was given as single dose infusion (single dose group) and in 18 patients the same initial bolus was followed by a continuous perfusion (25-30 ml/min) with modified blood from the heart-lung machine (continuous blood group). Simultaneous samples were drawn from arterial and coronary sinus blood before and during the first 60 min after cardioplegia. In the continuous blood group, samples were also drawn during the period of cardioplegic perfusion. The samples were analyzed for PO 2, O2-saturation and content, PCO2, pH, lactate, pyruvate, glucose, potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB, and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT). In addition myoglobin and enzymes were followed in peripheral venous blood for 24 hours. Myocardial biopsies were taken from the left ventricle at the beginning and end of cardioplegia and analyzed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine (C) and creatinephosphate (CP). The pattern of metabolic changes after cardioplegia was similar in both groups with decreased myocardial oxygen extraction, marked lactate and potassium release, increased glucose uptake and significant enzyme and myoglobin release. However, the degree of changes was significantly smaller in the continuous blood group. The myocardial biopsies also showed significantly less ATP and CP decrease in the continuous blood group, suggesting, together with the other metabolic results, that the myocardial protection afforded by continuous blood cardioplegia was superior to that of the single dose group. Furthermore, continuous perfusion permitted easy control of myocardial temperature during the period of aortic cross-clamping.
