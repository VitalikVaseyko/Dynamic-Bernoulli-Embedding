The enzyme complement of two different mitochondrial preparations from adult rat brain has been studied. One population of mitochondria (synaptic) is prepared by the lysis of synaptosomes, the other (non-synaptic or free) by separation from homogenates. These populations have been prepared from distinct regions of the brain: cortex, striatum, and pons and medulla oblongata. The following enzymes have been measured: pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1), citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7), NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41), NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2), NAD-linked malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), D-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30), and mitochondrially bound hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) and creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2). The nonsynaptic (free) mitochondria show higher enzyme specific activities in the regions studied than the corresponding values recorded for the synaptic mitochondria. The significance of these observations is discussed in the light of the different metabolic activities of the two populations of mitochondria and the compartmentation of the metabolic activities of the brain.
