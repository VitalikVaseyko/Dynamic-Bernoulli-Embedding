The current literature on the role of microRNA (miRNA) in tumour metabolism is growing, and a number of studies regularly confirm the impact miRNA can have in energy reprograming in tumours. However, there remains to be a lack of understanding of the larger perspective of the role of miRNA in the metabolism story. In the first part of this review, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the extensive role of miRNAs in tumour metabolism including glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism. However, in the second part, we aim to provide a description of the multidimensional role miRNA can be playing in tumour metabolism. Of paramount importance is the role miRNA has in responding to metabolic cues and how it can alter cellular state and fate, including cancer stem cells, in response to such cues. In addition, exosomal miRNAs can provide means by which cells can communicate metabolic signals and messages with other cells within the tumour microenvironment, altering therefore the phenotype and functional capacity of these cells. With this expanding area of research better understanding of the role of miRNA in tumour metabolism in a mechanistic approach, and not only describing which miRNAs can effect which genes, can help to exploit the therapeutic implications behind the extensive role of miRNA in tumour metabolism.
