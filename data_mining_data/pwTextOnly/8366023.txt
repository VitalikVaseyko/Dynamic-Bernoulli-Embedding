A fragment of 1,185 bp containing the gene coding for phosphofructokinase (ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate-1-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.11) in Lactobacillus bulgaricus has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence of this enzyme was homologous to those of the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinases from E. coli, Thermus thermophilus, Spiroplasma citri, and Bacillus stearothermophilus, suggesting that these enzymes have closely related structures despite their different regulatory properties. The recombinant protein had the same structural and functional properties as did the original enzyme. The 3' end of the 1,185-bp fragment showed the presence of an open reading frame corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the pyruvate kinase from L. bulgaricus. This gene organization, the same as that in S. citri (C. Chevalier, C. Saillard, and J. M. Bove, J. Bacteriol. 172:2693-2703, 1990) and B. stearothermophilus (D. Walker, W. N. Chia, and H. Muirhead, J. Mol. Biol. 228:265-276, 1992; H. Sakai and T. Ohta, Eur. J. Biochem. 311:851-859, 1993) but different from that in E. coli (H. W. Hellinga and P. R. Evans, Eur. J. Biochem. 149:363-373, 1985), indicated that the same transcription unit apparently contained the genes for phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, the two key enzymes of glycolysis. The possibility that these genes could be transcribed at the same time suggested that in L. bulgaricus, the coordinated regulation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase occurs at the levels of both biosynthesis and enzymatic activity.
