It is shown in experiments is vivo that development of experimental metabolic alkalosis in rats is followed by changes in redox processes in the eye retina and tunic. For the first two months of the experiment the number of sulphydryl group decreases, while that of disulphide ones of water-soluble proteins and low-molecular compounds increases. The amount of oxidized metabolites of glycolysis and of a cycle of tricarboxylic acids (pyruvate, oxaloacetate, alpha-ketoglutarate) increases relative to the reduced ones (lactate, isocitrate, malate), as well as activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase, while activities of fructose diphosphatase, glucoso-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase fall. The content of malonic dialdehyde increases. 90 days later disorders of certain compensatory mechanisms of the metabolic system of alkalosis regulation probably occurred in the eye retina and tunic tissues: hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity fell to the control values, while that of NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase--below the control level; the content of lactate increased. Activity of glutathione-dependent enzymes remained low and the amount of malonic dialdehyde grew much more than in the previous terms.
