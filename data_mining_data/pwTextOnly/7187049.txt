Craviten effect on platelets suspended in their own plasma was investigated by two methods of incubation with the drug: the fresh platelets were incubated for 18 h at 4 degrees C with Craviten added to plasma and platelets stored for 18 h at 4 degrees C without Craviten were incubated with Craviten at 37 degrees C for 1 h. For evaluation of the metabolic activity and function of the platelets, the levels of high-energy compounds ATP and ADP, the activity of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase and the amount of adenyl nucleotides released by the platelets after thrombin addition were measured, and the spontaneous aggregation of platelets and c-AMP were determined. The experiments demonstrated that Craviten prevented the fall of ATP level of the stored platelets, raised the activity of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase in the platelets, increased the amount of nucleotides released by the platelets in the release reaction. Craviten inhibited also increased spontaneous aggregation of stored platelets and raised c-AMP level.
