The in vitro binding of [3H]-AFB1 to various proteins was studied by equilibrium dialysis. At 23 +/- 1 degree C, [3H]-AFB1 binding activity (mmol/mol) decreased as follows: pyruvate kinase > albumin-NLS > albumin > carbonic anhydrase > RNase > histones. The nuclear translocation and activation of AFB1 and AFB-protein complexes was investigated using isolated rat liver nuclei in the presence of ATP and a NADPH regenerating system. Proteins containing NLS such as histones and albumin-NLS facilitated AFB1 translocation into the nucleus where activation and adduct formation took place.
