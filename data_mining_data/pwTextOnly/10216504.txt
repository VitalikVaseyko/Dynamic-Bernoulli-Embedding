The diagnostic value of the tumor marker pyruvate kinase type tumor M2 was evaluated in patients with benign, malignant and metastasizing pancreatic lesions and compared to the reference markers CA19-9 and CEA. This prospective study comprised 166 individuals; 66 patients had various pancreatic pathologies (38 histologically proven pancreatic cancer, 28 benign pancreatic lesions such as pseudotumorous pancreatitis, pseudocysts or pancreatic (cyst)adenoma) and 100 healthy blood donors served as controls. With a cut-off value of 28 U/ml (corresponding to a specificity of 90%) the sensitivity of TUM2-PK for pancreatic cancer (as related to the control group) was 79% (CA19-9: 65%, CEA: 22%). There was a good correlation between the TUM2-PK levels and tumor metastasis (p < 0.001 for no versus distant metastasis, p = n.s. for CA19-9 and CEA). However, TUM2-PK was also elevated in 64.3% of the patients with benign pancreatic pathologies. In our study TUM2-PK had good diagnostic qualities for pancreatic cancer and also showed better correlation to metastasis than CA 19-9 and CEA.
