The primary catabolic pathways in the fungi Penicillium notatum and P. duponti, and Mucor rouxii and M. miehei were examined by measuring the relative rate of 14CO2 production from different carbon atoms of specifically labelled glucose. It was found that these organisms dissimilate glucose predominantly via the Embden--Meyerhof pathway in conjunction with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and to a lesser extent by the pentose phosphate pathway. Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) activity could not be detected initially in Penicillium species because of the interference from mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.17) and NADH oxidase (EC 1.6.99.3). A combination of differential centrifuging and a heat treatment of Penicillium cell-free extracts in the presence of fructose-6-phosphate removed the interfering enzymes. The kinetic characteristics of phosphofructokinase from P. notatum and M. rouxii are described. The enzyme presents highly cooperative kinetics for fructose-6-phosphate. The kinetics for ATP show no cooperativity and inhibition by excess ATP is observed. The addition of AMP activated the P. notatum enzyme, relieving ATP inhibition; slight inhibition by AMP was observed with the M. rouxii enzyme. In contrast M. rouxii pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) is activated 50-fold by fructose-1,6-diphosphate whereas pyruvate kinase from P. notatum and P. duponti were unaffected by fructose-1,6-diphosphate.
