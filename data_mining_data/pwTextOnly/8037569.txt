The activities of the key glycolytic enzymes i.e. hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were detected and investigated in 3 strains of Streptomyces rimosus differing in the level of the oxytetracycline production. The samples were assayed at different fermentation stages and under different aeration conditions. Correlation between the level of the pyruvate kinase activity within the first days of the fermentation process and the strain capacity for the antibiotic accumulation at the final stage of the fermentation process was observed.
