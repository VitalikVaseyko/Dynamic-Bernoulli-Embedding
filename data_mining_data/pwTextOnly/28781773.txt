BACKGROUND: Methionine is an essential amino acid for fish. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary methionine on growth performance, digestive and absorptive ability, as well as antioxidant capacity in the intestine and hepatopancreas of sub-adult grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). RESULTS: Dietary methionine deficiency significantly decreased percentage weight gain (PWG), feed intake, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio, as well as activities of hepatopancreatic glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and muscle glutamate-pyruvate transaminase in sub-adult grass carp (P < 0.05). Furthermore, methionine deficiency significantly reduced activities of trypsin, lipase and amylase in the intestine, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in three intestinal segments, and creatine kinase (CK) in the proximal intestine (P < 0.05). However, an unexplained and significant increase in CK activity in the mid intestine was associated with dietary methionine deficiency. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents in the intestine and hepatopancreas were significantly increased by methionine deficiency (P < 0.05), whereas anti-hydroxyl radical capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine, and anti-superoxide anion capacity in the intestine, were significantly decreased by methionine deficiency (P < 0.05). Moreover, methionine deficiency significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities, glutathione contents in the hepatopancreas and intestine, as well as glutathione peroxidase activity in the intestine (P < 0.05), whereas it significantly increased activities of catalase in the hepatopancreas and glutathione-S-transferase in the hepatopancreas and intestine (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrated that dietary methionine deficiency induced poor growth, and decreased digestive and absorptive function and antioxidant capacity in the hepatopancreas and intestine of sub-adult grass carp. Methionine requirements for sub-adult grass carp (450-1, 170 g) based on PWG, intestinal trypsin, and hepatopancreatic anti-hydroxyl radical activities were estimated to be 6.12 g/kg diet (21.80 g/kg protein), 6.99 g/kg diet (24.90 g/kg protein) and 5.42 g/kg diet (19.31 g/kg protein), respectively, in the presence of 1.50 g cysteine/kg (5.35 g/kg protein).
