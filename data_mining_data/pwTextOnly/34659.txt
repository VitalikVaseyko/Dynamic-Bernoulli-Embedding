The antivibrionic activity of crystalline preparations of five enzymes of the glycolytic cycle of animals cells was investigated. Phosphorylase "a" (0.5 mg/ml), aldolase (15 mg/ml) and pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml) were found to inhibit the proliferation of Vibrio cholerae cells; phosphoglucomutase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml were found to be vibriocidal. A mixture of these enzymes containing 0.062 mg/ml of phosphorylase "a" and 0.125 mg/ml of each phosphoglucomutase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase showed vibriocidal activity.
