1. The renaturation of Neurospora pyruvate kinase following denaturation with urea was investigated. 2. The substrates, phosphoenol pyruvate and adenosine diphosphate, were observed to stabilize the enzyme against urea-induced structural disorganization. 3. It was demonstrated that for refolding/reactivation of the denatured protein the allosteric activator, fructose-1,6-diphosphate and a sulphydryl protectant are required. 4. The enzyme recovered following renaturation showed complete immunological identity with the native enzyme in Ouchterlony double diffusion tests.
