Pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities were determined in microdissected freeze-dried liver cells from the periportal and pericentral area of the liver lobule. Pyruvate kinase activity was measured by a microfluorimetric procedure adapted to 20-200 ng tissue dry weight. In livers from fed rats, its activity was twice as high in the central zone as in the periportal cells; starvation reduced this gradient by decreasing central activities. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity was measured by a microradiochemical technique in 100-300 ng tissue dry weight. In livers from fed rats, this enzyme was nearly 3 times more active in the periportal cells than in the central area. Starvation increased this enzyme in both zones with a more pronounced change in the central cells. The results indicate a heterogeneous distribution of enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in the liver lobule. Gluconegenesis seems to be localized preferentially in periportal hepatocytes, whereas the glycolytic enzyme was found to be more active in cells surrounding the pericentral liver cells.
