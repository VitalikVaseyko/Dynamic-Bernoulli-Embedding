Pyruvate kinase from bovine adrenal cortex was purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous state. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is about 230 000, that of one subunit is 57 000. The maximal values of the pyruvate kinase initial reaction rate were obtained in 50 mM imidazole-acetate buffer within the pH range of 6.8 to 7.0. The curve of the initial pyruvate kinase reaction rate versus phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP concentrations is hyperbolic and obeys the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km for PEP and ADP of 0.055 X 10(-3) M and 0.25 X 10(-3) M, respectively. The enzyme is activated by Mn2+ and Co2+ by 43 and 38%, respectively. IDP, GDP, and UDP may be used as analogs of ADP. The enzyme is not activated by fructose-1.6-diphosphate and is inhibited by L-phenylalanine and ATP.
