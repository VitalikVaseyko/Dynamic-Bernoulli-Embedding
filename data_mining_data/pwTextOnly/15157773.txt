Successful preservation of small bowel (SB) is closely correlated with the maintenance of cellular energetics. This study was designed to assess the ability of a modified UW solution supplemented with buffer and glucose to facilitate ATP production during cold storage. In part A, rats SB (n = 4) were flushed vascularly as follows: Group 1, UW solution (control); Group 2, HUW solution (UW+90 mM histidine). Inclusion of histidine resulted in a >3-fold increase in buffering capacity over the pH range 7.4-6.8. Positive effects of histidine on ATP and energy charge were apparent after 4-10h storage. Examination of the key regulatory enzyme, Phosphofructokinase (PFK), reflected a sustained activation was over 1-4h in the HUW group only. In part B, groups were vascularly flushed as follows: Group 1, HUW solution (control); Group 2, Group 1+20mM glucose; and Group 3, Group 2+luminal flush. Elevated ATP and total adenylates over 2-10h in Group 3 compared to control were a direct consequence of improved glycolytic activity. This data supports the hypothesis that tissue energetics can be significantly improved during cold storage using a histidine-buffered UW solution supplemented with carbohydrate substrate.
