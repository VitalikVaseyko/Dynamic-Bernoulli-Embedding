The level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the maximal activities of key gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes were determined in the liver of a rat model of chronic uremia and in ad libitum-fed control and pair-fed control animals. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was decreased in uremia and its level negatively correlated with the concentration of blood urea nitrogen. The changes in gluconeogenic enzymes in uremic rats were not different from those in the pair-fed controls. However, pyruvate kinase was decreased in uremia when compared to both controls. These studies offer a possible mechanism for the role of the liver in the carbohydrate intolerance of uremia.
