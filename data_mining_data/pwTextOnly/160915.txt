In the lungs of CFLP mice the activities of glycolytic key enzymes (HK, PFK, PK) and LDH as well as LDH isozymic pattern change in the course of life. The activities of these glycolytic enzymes in the lung tumors induced by urethan in CFLP mice are significantly higher than those in the normal adult lung and they are similar to those in the normal fetal lung. The isozymic pattern of LDH of pulmonary adenomas resembles that of the normal fetal lung, too.
