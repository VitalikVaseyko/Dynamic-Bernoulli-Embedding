A mutation was recovered in the slr0721 gene, which encodes the decarboxylating NADP(+)-dependent malic enzyme in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, yielding the mutant 3WEZ. Under continuous light, 3WEZ exhibits poor photoautotrophic growth while growing photoheterotrophically on glucose at rates nearly indistinguishable from wild-type rates. Interestingly, under diurnal light conditions (12 h of light and 12 h of dark), normal photoautotrophic growth of the mutant is completely restored.
