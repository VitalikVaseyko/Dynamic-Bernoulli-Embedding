OBJECTIVE: To detect some proteins associated with the effect of ganoderma lucidium spores (GASP) on promoting the survival and axon regeneration of injured spinal motor neurons in rats. METHODS: The rats were divided into normal control group, untreated group and GASP-treated group, and the rats in the last two groups received ventral root avulsion. GASP preparation was fed to the rats in the GASP-treated group for 14 days. The gray matter tissues of the lumbar spinal were sampled from rats in each group after 14 days following ventral root avulsion, and the extracted proteins from these tissues were detected by using 2-dimensional electrophoresis. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) was utilized to identify the differentially expressed proteins among these three groups. RESULTS: There were six kinds of proteins differentially expressed among the three groups, which were collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), F-actin capping protein beta subunit (FCP-beta), isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit beta (IDH-beta), ATPase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase-1 (GOT1) and M2 pyruvate kinase (M2-PK). The expression levels of CRMP-2, IDH-beta, ATPase and GOT1 were higher in the GASP-treated group than those in the untreated group, while the expression levels of FCP-beta and M2-PK were lower than those in the untreated group. CONCLUSION: GASP maybe promotes the survival and axon regeneration of injured spinal motor neurons in rats by virtue of up- or down-regulating the expression levels of the proteins mentioned above.
