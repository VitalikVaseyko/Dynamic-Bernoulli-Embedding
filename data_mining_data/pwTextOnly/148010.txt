Three control point enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) were measured by quantitative histochemical methods in individual hypothalamic nuclei of adult neonatally androgenized female rats. HK activity was significantly increased in anterior hypothalamic nuclei: medial preoptic, lateral preoptic, and suprachiasmatic. PK was significantly elevated in the lateral preoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus and also in the medial mamillary nucleus and median eminence. No significant changes occurred in PFK activity.
