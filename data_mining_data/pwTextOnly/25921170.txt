BACKGROUND: Diallyl disulfide (DADS) may exert potent anticancer action both in vitro and in vivo. Although its effects on cancer are significant, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we sought to elucidate possible links between DADS and pyruvate kinase (PKM2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: KG1alpha, a leukemia cell line highly expressing PKM2 was used with a cell counting kit (CCK)-8 and flow cytometry (FCM) to investigate the effects of DADS. Relationships between PKM2 and DADS associated with phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK1/2 and MEK, were assessed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: In KG1alpha cells highly expressing PKM2, we found that DADS could affect proliferation, apoptosis and EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways, abrogating EGF-induced nuclear accumulation of PKM2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that DADS suppressed the proliferation of KG1alpha cells, providing evidence that its proapoptotic effects are mediated through the inhibition of EGFR/ERK/PKM2 signaling pathways.
