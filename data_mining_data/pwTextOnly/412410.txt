Mononuclear cells of malnourished children contain diminished activity of phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase (PK). The PK activity of these cells correlates well with the percentage of circulating thymus-derived lymphocytes (T-cells). Phytohemagglutinin causes an immediate increase in PK activity of mononuclear cells of malnourished patients. The correlation of PK activity with T-cells and the response of PK activity to phytohemagglutinin are in distinct contrast to observed perturbations of neonatal mononuclear cell metabolism. The relationship of the metabolic alterations to the pathophysiology of the immune system in malnutrition has not yet been defined.
