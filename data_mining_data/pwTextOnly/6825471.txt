The chromosome localization and gene synteny of soluble malate dehydrogenase (MDH1), soluble isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2), phosphoglucomutase-3 (PGM3), mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), nucleoside phosphorylase (NP), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), hexosaminidase A (HEXA), inosine triphosphatase (ITPA), and N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosaminidase (NAGA) were determined in the rhesus monkey using somatic cell hybrids. Comparison with the human and Pongidae syntenic groups shows that chromosome banding homologies do not always correlate with gene mapping data.
