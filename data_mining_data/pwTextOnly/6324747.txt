The presence of adenosine (25-250 microM) or of 2-chloroadenosine (2.5-100 microM) in the incubation medium caused a marked decrease in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in isolated hepatocytes. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP, an activation of phosphorylase and of fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, and an inactivation of pyruvate kinase and of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase. As a rule, the changes in the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-modifying system were slower but more persistent than those in the activities of phosphorylase and pyruvate kinase. The effect of the nucleoside to decrease the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was not affected by an inhibitor of adenosine transport and could not be obtained in a liver high-speed supernatant. These data indicate that the effect of adenosine to decrease the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is mediated by the stimulation of adenylate cyclase, secondary to the binding of adenosine to membranous receptors. Like glucagon, 2-chloroadenosine stimulated gluconeogenesis in isolated hepatocytes, whereas adenosine had an opposite effect.
