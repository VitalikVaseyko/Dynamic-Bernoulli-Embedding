The metabolic properties of mitochondria from rat cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb were investigated. The pyruvate-supported oxygen uptake rates by olfactory bulb mitochondria were significantly lower than those by cerebrocortical mitochondria. This is consistent with the differences in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activities between these mitochondrial preparations. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, NAD-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, and hexokinase activities in olfactory bulb mitochondria were significantly lower than those in cerebrocortical mitochondria. However, NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, and NAD-linked and NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase activities in olfactory bulb mitochondria were significantly higher than those in cerebrocortical mitochondria. The differences between these two mitochondrial preparations in terms of the activities of these energy-metabolizing enzymes reflect the differences detected in the homogenates of these regions.
