Triacylglycerol synthesis was studied in hepatocytes isolated from fasted/refed rats by EDTA perfusion. Insulin induced a 1.5-fold increase in glucose incorporation into triacylglycerol. Insulin-stimulated triacylglycerol synthesis and insulin-stimulated protein kinase B/Akt activity were inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059. Inhibition of p70 ribosomal protein-S6 kinase with rapamycin was without effect. Insulin-stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was abolished by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. No effect of insulin on acetyl CoA carboxylase activity was observed.
