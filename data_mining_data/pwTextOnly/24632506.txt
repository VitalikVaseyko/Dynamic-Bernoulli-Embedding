Src kinase, a prototype member of the Src family of kinases (SFKs), is over-expressed in various human tumors, and has become a target for anticancer drug design. In this perspective, a series of eighteen 2-pyridone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their c-Src kinase inhibitory activity. Among them, eight compounds exhibited c-Src kinase inhibitory activity with IC50 value of less than 25muM. Compound 1-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-5-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one (36) exhibited the highest c-Src kinase inhibition with an IC50 value of 12.5muM. Furthermore, the kinase inhibitory activity of compound 36 was studied against EGFR, MAPK and PDK, however no significant activity was observed at the highest tested concentration (300muM). These results provide insights for further optimization of this scaffold for designing the next generation of 2-pyridone derivatives as candidate Src kinase inhibitors.
