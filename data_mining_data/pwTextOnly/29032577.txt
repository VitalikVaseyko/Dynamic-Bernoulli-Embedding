The aim of this study was to analyze the significance of glucose metabolism-related enzymes in the proliferation of gastric cancer under hypoxia. Four hypoxia-resistant gastric cancer cell lines and four parent cell lines were used. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of the following metabolism-related enzymes: pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), glutaminase (GLS), enolase 1 (ENO1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and PKM1. The effects of these enzymes on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells were examined using siRNAs, shikonin as a PKM2 inhibitor, or BPTES as a GLS inhibitor, in vitro and in vivo. Levels of both PKM2 and GLS mRNA were significantly high in all hypoxia-resistant cell lines, compared with those of their parent cells. Knockdown of PKM2 and GLS significantly decreased the proliferation of all hypoxia-resistant cells. The combination of siPKM2 and siGLS significantly decreased proliferation compared with treatment by siPKM2 or siGLS alone. The knockdown of ENO1, G6PDH, or PKM1 did not decrease the proliferation of all hypoxia-resistant cells. Combination treatment using shikonin and BPTES inhibited the proliferation of all hypoxia-resistant cancer cells more than that by either agent alone. The in vivo study indicated that the tumor size treated by the combination of shikonin and BPTES was significantly smaller than that of vehicle-treated group. These findings suggested that PKM2 and GLS might play important roles in the proliferation of hypoxic gastric cancer cells. A combination of PKM2 and GLS inhibitors could be therapeutically promising for the treatment of gastric cancer.
