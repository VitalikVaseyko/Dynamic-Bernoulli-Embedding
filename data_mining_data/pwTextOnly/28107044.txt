AKT signaling is important to maintaining normal physiology. Hyperactivation of AKT signaling is frequent in cancer, which maintains a high oxidative state in a tumor microenvironment that is needed for tumor adaptation. Therefore, antioxidants are proposed to exhibit anticancer properties by interfering with the tumor microenvironment. Quercetin is an ubiquitous bioactive antioxidant rich in vegetables and beverages. The present study aimed to analyze cancer preventive property of quercetin in ascite cells of Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice. Protein level was determined by Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) level was estimated spectrophotometrically using Griess reagent. Results show downregulation in phosphorylation of AKT and PDK1 by quercetin, which was consistent with decreased phosphorylation of downstream survival factors such as BAD, GSK-3beta, mTOR, and IkBalpha. Further, quercetin attenuated the levels of angiogenic factor VEGF-A and inflammatory enzymes COX-2 and iNOS as well as NO levels, whereas it increased the levels of phosphatase PTEN. Overall results suggest that quercetin modulates AKT signaling leading to attenuation of cell survival, inflammation, and angiogenesis in lymphoma-bearing mice.
