Recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II, catecholamines, and vasopressin can stimulate the phosphorylation of hepatic cytosolic proteins via a Ca2+-linked cyclic AMP-independent mechanism. The present study used high resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to determine if the proteins phosphorylated in response to the Ca2+-linked hormones were distinct from those affected by glucagon acting via the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway. Intact hepatocytes labeled with [32P]PO4(3-) were stimulated with glucagon, angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, and vasopressin and over 100 phosphorylated proteins resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography. Six important enzymes known to be regulated through covalent modification were positively identified, including phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, fructose-6-phosphate, 2-kinase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Computer analysis of the autoradiograms from control and hormone-treated cells demonstrated that glucagon increased the phosphorylation state of 12 phosphoproteins and reduced the phosphorylation of one protein with a Mr = 21,000 and a pI = 5.9. The Ca2+-linked hormones stimulated the phosphorylation of 7 phosphoproteins and also reduced the phosphorylation state of the 21,000-dalton protein. Angiotensin II, l-norepinephrine, and vasopressin had equivalent effects on protein phosphorylation. There were six protein substrates uniquely affected by glucagon and one phosphoprotein uniquely stimulated by the Ca2+-linked hormones. Seven substrates were affected by stimulation of the cell with either glucagon or the Ca2+-linked hormones. These results demonstrate that, while there is overlap in the substrates affected by glucagon and the Ca2+-linked hormones, each pathway is able to affect the phosphorylation of unique substrates. This finding suggests that the two types of hormones may have some distinct effects on hepatic function.U
