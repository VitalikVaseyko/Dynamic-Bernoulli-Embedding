1. Kinetic and regulatory properties of pyruvate kinase have been studied in haemolysates of erythrocytic populations from blood and bone marrow of rats. 2. Pyruvate kinase from normal rat erythrocytes showed sigmoidal kinetics vs phosphoenolpyruvate. In contrast, the enzyme from reticulocytes and erythroid-rich bone marrow cells behaved as hyperbolic. 3. The enzyme activities were always inhibited by ATP. Activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was only observed in erythrocytes. 4. These kinetic differences suggest changes in pyruvate kinase isozymes in cells of the erythrocytic line of rats.
