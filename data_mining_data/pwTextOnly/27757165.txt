Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is a rare non-spherocytic type of haemolytic anaemia. During pregnancy, women with severe PKD are at increased risk of infection, thrombosis, hypertension, fetal growth restriction and anaemia. Management of such cases requires close collaboration between a haematologist and an obstetrician. We report a case of severe PKD in pregnancy with good maternal and fetal outcome.
