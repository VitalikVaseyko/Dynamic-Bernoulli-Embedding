Chronic exposure of mammals to hypoxia induces a state of anorexia. We aimed to determine the role played by diet restriction in the alterations of myocardial energy metabolism occurring under chronic hypoxia in order to detect the specific effects of hypoxia per se. Adult female rats were exposed to normobaric hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.10) for three weeks; pair-fed rats, kept under normoxic conditions, received the same amount of food as hypoxic rats. The oxidative capacity of myocardial ventricles and some skeletal muscles was evaluated using permeabilized fibers. Several metabolic enzyme activities were measured on extracts from myocardium and soleus. Diet restriction increased the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in both ventricles while it augmented phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activities only in the left ventricle and depressed the respiratory rate in the right ventricle only. Hypoxia per se induced a rise in hexokinase activity in all studied oxidative muscles and a fall of hydroxy-acyl CoA-dehydrogenase activity in both myocardial ventricles. The respiratory rate and the citrate synthase activities were unaffected by hypoxia. We conclude that chronic hypoxia per se leads to specific alterations in myocardial metabolism that could favor the use of exogenous glucose at the expense of free fatty acids without any change in the oxidative capacity.
