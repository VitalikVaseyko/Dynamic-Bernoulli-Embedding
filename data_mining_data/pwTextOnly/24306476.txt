Isozymes of hexose-phosphate isomerase (HPI; EC 5.3.1.9), pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH; EC 1.1.1.44) have been detected in the developing cotyledons of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), safflower (Carthamnus tinctorius L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). In each seed there are two isozymes each of PK and HPI. The isozyme patterns of 6PGDH are more complex: soybean has two forms of the enzyme, safflower three, and sunflower six. In each tissue, at least 25% of the activity of each of the three enzymes is in the plastids. This supports the proposal that the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways are operating in the plastids and that the plastids are the site of long-chain fatty-acid biosynthesis in developing oilseeds.
