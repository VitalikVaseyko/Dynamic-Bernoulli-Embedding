The basic ferritin level in red cells was examined in 60 healthy volunteers and in 110 patients with various diseases of the red cell series. From samples of heparinized whole blood first leucocytes were removed and then they were haemolyzed. After subsequent centrifuging in the supernatant the basic ferritin content was assessed by means of an Amersham Ferritin RIA kit (Amersham, Great Britain). Normal values in healthy volunteers varied between 3.2 and 30.2 ag/ery. In patients with iron deficiency the values were significantly reduced, in patients with pernicious anaemia, beta-thalassemia minor, hereditary spherocytosis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or pyruvate kinase deficiency the levels of red cell ferritin were significantly elevated, as compared with the control group. The red cell ferritin level depends on the iron supply to cells of the red cell series and the amount needed for erythropoiesis. A reduced supply in sideropenia leads to a reduced level of red cell ferritin, in haemolytic anaemia its level depends on the generally elevated iron supply in the organism and possibly impaired haemoglobin synthesis, on the one hand, and concurrent elevated iron requirements in case of hyperplasia of red cell formation, on the other hand. Assessment of red cell ferritin is important not only for accurate estimation of the amount of iron available in the cell for haeme formation but also to elucidate the pathogenesis of some changes of iron metabolism in diseases of the red cell series.
