Only one isozyme M2 of pyruvate kinase was found in the liver of hens at all stages of embryonic and postembryonic development. No analogue to isozyme L from the liver of mammals was found. During embryogenesis and postnatal life, isozyme M2 is presented by two forms which differ in pI values. Throughout embryonic and postembryonic development, pyruvate kinase is presented by two forms which differ in their substrate affinity.
