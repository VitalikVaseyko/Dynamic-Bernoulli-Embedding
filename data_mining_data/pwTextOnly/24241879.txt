Negatively charged large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were incubated with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. xanthi) cell suspensions and with the cell-free medium of the cell suspensions. The extent of cell-LUV interaction was determined by the leakage of the LUV contents. Cells enhanced the leakage of LUV contents and this effect increased with cell age. Addition of polylysine to the reaction mixture increased even further the leakage of the LUV contents. The cell-free medium of the cell suspension also affected the integrity of the LUV. Cell-free medium, by itself, promoted leakage of LUV contents and caused a reduction in the leakage exerted by polylysine. Centrifugation (8000g) of the cell-free medium decreased its effect, heat treatment (122 degrees C) did not alter its effect and sonication enhanced it. The effects of the cell-free medium are attributed to the presence of cell wall debris of disintegrated cells.
