We report the sequence of the single chicken triosephosphate isomerase gene and its flanking regions. The 3-kilobase-long gene is composed of seven similarly sized exons and six introns. By using crystallographic and sequence data, we argue that this ancient gene was originally assembled from the genetic antecedents of exons.
