When the chemical carcinogen, DMBA, is administered by intragastric intubation to young adult female mice already subjected to partial hepatectomy, the glycolytic key enzymes (hexokinases, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) and lactate dehydrogenase show declined levels in the regenerating liver. But concomitant administration of MPG, a hepatotropic detoxicant, with DMBA either nullifies or minimizes the effect of the carcinogen on these enzymes.
