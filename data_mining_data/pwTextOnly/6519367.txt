In hepatocyte cultures derived from 15-day-old foetal rats, the appearance of the liver (L) form of pyruvate kinase is blocked when cytosine arabinoside is added on the 2nd day of culture. When added on the 3rd day of culture, the inhibitor of DNA synthesis does not prevent the appearance of the enzyme. If cytosine arabinoside is added on the 2nd day of culture and removed on the 4th day, the enzyme is detected by the 6th day of culture. The specificity of the action of cytosine arabinoside for the L form of pyruvate kinase is in contrast with the lack of effect observed on total protein synthesis and the activity of the embryonic (M2) form of the enzyme.
