Chloroquine at pH 8.0 and 1mM [corrected] concentration inhibits about 30% glucose consumption and ethanol formation in yeast cells. Out of the 11 glycolytic enzymes assayed, phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate decarboxylase have been found to be most sensitive to chloroquine. Next sensitive are hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase. Kinetic studies with the three kinases studied revealed competitive inhibition of chloroquine with ATP (hexokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase) or ADP (pyruvate kinase).
