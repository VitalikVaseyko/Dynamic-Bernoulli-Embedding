It has been previously shown that triglycerides can be specifically hydrolyzed by lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus in the presence of hog liver esterase and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The glycerol produced can then be measured by sequential reactions with glycerokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase: glycerol and ATP are converted to glycerol-3-phosphate and ADP by glycerokinase; the ADP reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase to yield pyruvate; the pyruvate is converted to lactate with lactate dehydrogenase, and the cofactor NAD+ is simultaneously reduced to NADH. This report describes procedures by which either the disappearance of NADH or the appearance of NAD+ was determined fluorometrically, with 10- to 100-fold greater sensitivity than by spectrophotometry. In addition, enzymatic cycling of NAD+ was used to increase the sensitivity of the assay over 1000-fold, and thereby provided accurate measurement of less than 1 ng of triglyceride. Results obtained from the three fluorometric methods were highly correlated with an automated periodate oxidation method using serum samples and lipid extracts of muscle tissue.
