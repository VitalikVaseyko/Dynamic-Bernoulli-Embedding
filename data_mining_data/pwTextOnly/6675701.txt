The metabolic consequences of PK enzymopathies on the energy metabolism have been studied by means of mathematical modelling. The proposed steady state model of glycolysis takes into account the main regulatory properties of the non-equilibrium enzymes and the Mg-complex formation by the adenine nucleotides and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The analysis of three distinct individual cases of PK enzymopathies has demonstrated that mathematical modelling may lead to a deeper understanding and a quantitative estimate of the metabolic disregulation.
