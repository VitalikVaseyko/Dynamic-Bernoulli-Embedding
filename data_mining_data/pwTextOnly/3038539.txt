L-type pyruvate kinase is an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway whose activity and mRNA levels fluctuate in the small intestine according to dietary status. Both the enzyme activity and mRNA concentration decline during fasting and increase upon refeeding either a glucose-rich or a fructose-rich diet. Using a single-strand M 13 phage complementary to L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA as probe, we determined the level of the mRNA in the small intestine of normal, adrenalectomized, thyroidectomized, diabetic and glucagon-treated or cAMP-treated animals refed either a glucose-rich or a fructose-rich diet. The specific mRNA is present in the small intestine of normal fasted rats and increases twofold and threefold on refeeding glucose and fructose respectively. However, the hormonal control of the gene expression differs according to the dietary carbohydrate. The L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA increase, induced by glucose feeding, is hormone-dependent and requires the presence of thyroid hormones and insulin. In fructose-fed rats a certain level of mRNA increase occurs regardless of the hormonal status of the animals, but the full induction of the mRNA by fructose requires the presence of glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and insulin. Thus, the hormonal regulation of L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression in the small intestine is largely similar to that described in normal rat liver but the basal mRNA level and the stimulation of the mRNA increase by fructose are higher in the small intestine.
