A gene (gckA) responsible for the activity of glycerate kinase has been identified within a chromosomal fragment of the serine cycle methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. A mutation in gckA leads to a specific C1-negative phenotype. The polypeptide sequence derived from gckA showed high similarity to a product of ttuD essential for tartrate metabolism in Agrobacterium vitis. Our data suggest that gckA and ttuD might be structural genes for glycerate kinase and that the serine cycle and the tartrate utilization pathway share a series of reactions.
