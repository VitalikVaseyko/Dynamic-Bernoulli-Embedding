We have created transgenic mice lines in which SV40 T and c-myc expression was controlled by the L-pyruvate kinase gene regulatory region which is responsible for hepatic and pancreatic expression specificity, and strong dependence of this expression upon the carbohydrate composition of the diet. Models of hepatoma and endocrine pancreatic tumors have been obtained. Both tumors were dependent upon the diet, since carbohydrates strongly increased frequency and precocity of both hepatic and pancreatic carcinomas.
