Activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and level of fetal hemoglobin were determined in a family with Fanconi's anemia. Superoxide dismutase activity was significantly decreased, but glutathione reductase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were normal. The fetal hemoglobin levels observed were increased when compared with standard levels.
