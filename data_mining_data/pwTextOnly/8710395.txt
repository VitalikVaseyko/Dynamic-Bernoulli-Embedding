Numerous findings have shown that enzyme deficiencies, especially those involved in the protection of red cells from oxidation may lead to hemolysis and hyperbilirubinemia. It is established that G6PD deficiency may be the cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, as has been found in several countries and among widely different ethnic groups. We try to establish the incidence of G6PD, PK and GSSG-R deficiencies in neonates with jaundice for a better assessment of the population at risk. The present investigation was carried out in the attempt to be certain whether these enzymes could play a part in the development of neonatal jaundice. A total of 341 neonates of both sexes with jaundice were analyzed: 47 with G6PD deficiency; 9 with PK deficiency and 2 with GSSG-R deficiency.
