Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) plays a key role in tumor metabolism and regulates the rate-limiting final step of glycolysis. In tumor cells, there are two allosteric effectors for PKM2: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and serine. However, the relationship between FBP and serine for allosteric regulation of PKM2 is unknown. Here we constructed residue/residue fluctuation correlation network based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the regulation mechanism. The results suggest that the correlation network in bound PKM2 is distinctly different from that in the free state, FBP/PKM2, or Ser/PKM2. The community network analysis indicates that the information can freely transfer from the allosteric sites of FBP and serine to the substrate site in bound PKM2, while there exists a bottleneck for information transfer in the network of the free state. Furthermore, the binding free energy between the substrate and PKM2 for bound PKM2 is significantly lower than either of FBP/PKM2 or Ser/PKM2. Thus, a hypothesis of "synergistic allosteric mechanism" is proposed for the allosteric regulation of FBP and serine. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the perturbational and mutational analyses of community networks and binding free energies. Finally, two possible synergistic allosteric pathways of FBP-K433-T459-R461-A109-V71-R73-MG2-OXL and Ser-I47-C49-R73-MG2-OXL were identified based on the shortest path algorithm and were confirmed by the network perturbation analysis. Interestingly, no similar pathways could be found in the free state. The process targeting on the allosteric pathways can better regulate the glycolysis of PKM2 and significantly inhibit the progression of tumor.
