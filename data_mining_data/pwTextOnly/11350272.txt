Myocardial functional recovery and creatine kinase (CK) release following various periods of ischaemia were investigated in isolated mouse hearts. The hearts were perfused in the Langendorff mode with pyruvate-containing Krebs-Hensleit (KH) buffer under a constant perfusion pressure of 80 mmHg, and were subjected to either continuous perfusion or to 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 or 60 min of global ischaemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. In hearts subjected to ischaemic periods of 5, 15 or 20 min, there was a transient reduction in the left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max during the early phase of reperfusion, while the recovery at the end of reperfusion reached a level similar to that in hearts subjected to continuous perfusion. In hearts subjected to longer ischaemic periods, i.e. 25, 30, 45 or 60 min, the decrease in the cardiac performance was more pronounced and persistent, with significantly lower recovery in LV dP/dt max and higher LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) at the end of reperfusion than in the non-ischaemic hearts. There were no significant differences in the recoveries in coronary flow or in heart rate (HR) between groups. Similarly to the functional recovery, the release of CK showed a clear ischaemic length-related increase. In conclusion, the Langendorff-perfused isolated mouse heart could be a valuable model for studies of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Future studies using gene-targeted mice would add valuable knowledge to the understanding of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
