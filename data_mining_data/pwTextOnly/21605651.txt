ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Heart-protecting musk pill (HMP), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, has extensive cardioprotective effects against angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (MI), but the molecular mechanism behind such cardio protective effects still remains unclear. In this article, we aim to investigate the effect of HMP on mRNA expression in MI rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of coronary artery ligation was used to assess the cardioprotective effects of HMP. Microarray technology was applied to detect the gene expression in the heart of MI rats treated with HMP. Besides, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to verify the microarray results. RESULTS: Our results showed that HMP could ameliorate heart function, and diminish infarct size in MI rats. Compared with sham-operated rats, 500 genes' expression changed, with 234 genes down-regulated and 266 genes up-regulated. And the expression of 129 genes was different between HMP administrated rats and MI rats, with 22 genes down-regulated and 107 genes up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Citrate cycle (TCA cycle), Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and Pyruvate metabolism pathway are probably involved in the cardioprotective effects of HMP.
