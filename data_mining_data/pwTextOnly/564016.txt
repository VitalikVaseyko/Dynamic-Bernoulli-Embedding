An investigation of the carbohydrate energy metabolism of Rhabdias bufonis, the lung-dwelling nematode parasite of the African toad, Bufo regularis, indicates that the nematode stores very little glycogen (0.137 +/- 0.003% on a fresh weight basis) but does utilize oxygen in vitro. The intracellular distribution and high levels of activity observed for the enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and fumarate reductase suggest two alternative pathways of carbohydrate energy metabolism.
