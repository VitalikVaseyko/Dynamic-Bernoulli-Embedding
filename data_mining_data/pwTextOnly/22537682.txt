A small library of phenolic natural compounds belonging to different chemical classes was screened on a panel of targets involved in the genesis and progression of cancer. The re-investigation of their potential activity was achieved through the Inverse Virtual Screening approach. The normalization of the predicted binding energies permitted the selection of promising compounds on definite targets, avoiding the selection of false positive results. In vitro biological tests revealed the inhibitory activity of xanthohumol and isoxanthohumol on PDK1 and PKC protein kinases. This study validates the robustness of the Inverse Virtual Screening in silico approach as a useful tool for the identification of the specific biological activity of a given set of compounds.
