1. Some physico-chemical constants and the nutritional regulation of pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphofructokinase (PFK) and hexokinase (HK) from rainbow trout liver was investigated. 2. The maximum activity pH for the three enzymes appears to be in a physiological range. 3. The PK-enzyme shows sigmoid kinetic with respect to PEP with a Hill-coefficient of 3.1; the other two enzymes show michaelian kinetic for their substrates. 4. The nutritional treatments show that HK-enzyme increases its level with high carbohydrate diet and decreases with high protein diet and starvation. 5. PFK-enzyme decreases with high protein diet and starvation. 6. PK-enzyme only shows a decrease in level with starvation conditions.
