We studied the influence of chlorpromazine on the release of enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, EC 3.2.1.31; lactate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.27; pyruvate kinase, 2.7.1.40) and proteins using human granulocytes isolated and maintained at 37 degrees C. Chlorpromazine had a biphasic effect on enzyme release and the inhibition of the glycolytic pathway could be demonstrated only at high concentrations of chlorpromazine, after one hour's incubation. The NAD+/NADH ratio was significantly perturbed at all the concentrations. This effect is time dependent. The action of 4 other phenothiazine derivatives made it possible to establish a relationship between their physico-chemical properties and protein release. The results are compared with those from other studies using other biological materials.
