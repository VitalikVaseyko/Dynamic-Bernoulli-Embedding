Heterogeneous clinical features of inherited hemolytic anemia due to pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency were observed in three related homozygous patients. Erythrocytes were separated into old and young cells by means of density-layer centrifugation using a new supporting medium: Stractan-Urografin gradients. Those fractions containing older RBC disclosed defective PK which resulted in an impaired metabolism. Following an intake of chloramphenicol the clinical course of one female family member converted to acute monocytic leukemia. Thus, the report of a PK instability trait, in one family member associated with pancytopenia which converted in leukemia, suggests that inherited red cell enzyme deficiency might be also an expression of the vulnerability of the hematopoietic stem cells.
