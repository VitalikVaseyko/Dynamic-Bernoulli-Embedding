Decrease in intensity of lactate accumulation and activity of glycolytic enzyme such as: phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, pyruvate kinase found in staphylococcus of the second group isolated at vaginosis in comparison with staphylococcus of the third group isolated at vaginosis and concomitant additional infection pathology as well in comparison with staphylococcus of the first control group. Minimal inhibitory effect (MIA) and increase of enzyme activity of pentosephosphate ways such as: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transketolase testify to an intensification pentose-phosphate ways and decrease in activity of found the second groups staphylococcus isolated at vaginosis in comparison with of the in third group isolated at vaginosis and additional infection pathology as well as in comparison with the first control group staphylococcus isolated at normal state of UGT.
