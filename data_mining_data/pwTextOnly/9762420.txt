The isozymes of three glycolytic regulatory kinases: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase are fractionated by a single ion exchange chromatographic procedure on DEAE-cellulose. Enriched-erythroblast bone marrow cells showed two heterogeneous peaks, each consisting of two overlapping peaks: one major and one minor peak, but only two isozymes were observed in reticulocytes and erythrocytes. Phosphofructokinase showed multiple isozymic forms in the three cell populations, but while in erythroblasts the main one eluted in the last fractions, in reticulocytes and erythrocytes it eluted in the early fractions. Pyruvate kinase showed a main early activity peak with a shoulder in erythroblasts, reticulocytes and erythrocytes but the response to the allosteric effectors (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and ATP) suggests the presence of different pyruvate kinase isozymes in reticulocytes and erythrocytes.
