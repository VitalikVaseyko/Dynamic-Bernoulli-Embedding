As a member of the sirtuins family, also called Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs), SIRT6 has many catalytic enzyme activities and plays a pivotal role in biological processes including anti-aging, chromatin regulation, transcriptional control, glucose and lipid metabolism, and DNA damage repair. Recently, increasing evidences indicated that SIRT6 was related to initiation and development of tumors, such as hepatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and genital system tumors. However, SIRT6 might play a dual role in tumorigenesis and progression. SIRT6 often acted as a tumor suppressor, but might play an oncogenic role. Based on our current study, we depicted the essential roles of SIRT6 in the initiation and progression of various tumors, and summarized its mode of actions, which might provide clues for cancer therapy.
