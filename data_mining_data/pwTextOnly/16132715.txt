We studied the effect of exogenous adenosine in isolated perfused normoxic rat hearts on glycolytic flux through pyruvate kinase (PK). We compared its effect with that of myxothiazol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP production. Moreover, we tested whether an increase of membrane ionic flux with monensin is linked to a stimulation of glycolytic flux through PK. After a 20-min stabilization period adenosine, myxothiazol or monensin were administrated to the perfusate continuously at various concentrations during 10 min. The contraction was monitored and the lactate production in coronary effluents evaluated. The amount of adenine nucleotides and phosphoenolpyruvate was measured in the frozen hearts. Myxothiazol induced a decrease of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP : -40%) together with a stimulation of glycolytic flux secondary to PK activation. In contrast, adenosine primarily reduced heart rate (HR: -30%) with only marginal effects on LVDP. This was associated with an inhibition of glycolysis at the level of PK. The Na+ ionophore monensin affected HR (+14%) and LVDP (+25%). This effect was associated with a stimulation of glycolysis secondary to the stimulation of PK. These results provide new information of action of adenosine in the heart and support the concept of a direct coupling between glycolysis and process regulating sarcolemmal ionic fluxes.
