The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms related to plasma glucose concentration in mice fed a diet rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs). Male Crlj:CD-1 (ICR) mice were fed experimental diets containing 6% lard (LD), 6% fish oil (FO) or 4.1% lard plus 1.5% docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester and 0.4% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (DE) for 12 weeks. There were no marked differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentration changes on glucose tolerance test between the three dietary groups. At the end of the feeding trial, plasma glucose concentration was significantly lower in fasted mice in the FO group than in those in the LD group (P<.005). Plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in the FO group than in the LD group (P<.05). Hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activities in skeletal muscle tended to be lower in the FO group than in the LD group, while there were no differences in glucokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in liver between the three dietary groups. However, hepatic glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was 53-fold and 4.2-fold higher in the FO group than in the LD and DE groups, respectively (P<.0005 and P<.05, respectively). These results suggest that the reduction in plasma glucose concentration in mice fed n-3 PUFAs is mainly caused by acceleration of glucose uptake and glycerol synthesis in the liver rather than in the skeletal muscle.
