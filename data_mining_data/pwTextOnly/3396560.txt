The erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (2,3-DPG) and the activity of red cell hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase were studied in 27 normal volunteers before and after 2 and 4 months of physical endurance training. The 4 months of training increased maximal oxygen uptake and physical working capacity (PWC130) by 16% (p less than 0.001) and 29% (p less than 0.001) respectively. Resting heart rate was decreased (p less than 0.001) by 11 beats.min-1. With 2 months of training the erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentration increased by 9% (p less than 0.001); with 4 months training the increase was only 4% (p less than 0.05). The training-induced increase in red cell 2,3-DPG was not accompanied by enhanced activity of erythrocyte hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase or glutathione reductase. It is concluded that the rise in red cell 2,3-DPG induced by physical endurance training is not due to activation of red cell glycolytic enzymes or the enzymes involved in the pentose-phosphate cycle.
