The predominance of the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP/ADP) couple in cellular phosphorylation reactions, including those that form the basis for cellular energy metabolism, cannot be explained on thermodynamic grounds since a variety of "high energy phosphate" compounds (including ADP itself) found in the cell would, based on thermodynamic considerations, be at least as effective as ATP in serving as a phosphoryl donor. How then did present-day organisms come to rely on the ATP/ADP couple as the principal mediator of phosphorylation reactions? The early appearance of adenine compounds in the prebiotic environment is suggested by experiments indicating that, relative to other purine or pyridimine compounds, adenine derivatives are preferentially synthesized under simulated prebiotic conditions (Ponnamperuma et al., 1963). In addition to the roles of adenine nucleotides in phosphorylation reactions, other adenine derivatives (e.g. Coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, puridine nucleotides) are employed in a variety of metabolic roles. The principal function of the adenine moiety in these latter cases is in the binding of these derivatives to the relevant enzyme. The capability for binding of the adenine moiety appears to have arisen early in evolution and been exploited in a multitude of contexts, a suggestion consistent with observed similarities between the binding sites of several enzymes employing adenine derivatives as substrate. The early availability of suitable adenine compounds in the biosphere and development of complementary binding sites on cellular proteins, coupled with the expected advantages in having a limited number of metabolites as central mediators of endergonic and exergonic metabolism could readily have led to the observed pre-eminence of adenine nucleotides in cellular energy metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
