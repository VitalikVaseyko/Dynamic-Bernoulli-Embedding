Carbohydrate metabolism and the antioxidant defence system of heart and muscle of the Antarctic notothenioids Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps were evaluated in response to heat stress (8 degrees C) over 144 h. N. rossii heart exhibited decreased glycolysis and aerobic metabolism after up to 12 h of exposure to 8 degrees C, and anaerobiosis was inhibited within 24 h. However, these pathways were stimulated after 72 h at 8 degrees C. The consumption of glucose-6-phosphate, derived from hexokinase (HK), by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) decreased in N. rossii heart within 6 h at 8 degrees C, with a subsequent increase at 72 h. In N. rossii muscle at 8 degrees C, glycolysis was stimulated within 2 h by an increase in pyruvate kinase (PK), and aerobic metabolism was stimulated at 144 h, together with anaerobiosis. In N. coriiceps heart at 8 degrees C, glucose break down by HK decreased within 2 h and subsequently increased at 12 and 24 h. Increased glucose-6-phosphate consumption by G6PDH occurred within 6 h at 8 degrees C. In N. coriiceps muscle at 8 degrees C, glycolysis was stimulated at 2 and 6 h, with subsequent inhibition within 24 h, as indicated by HK activity. Aerobic metabolism was inhibited at 72 and 144 h at 8 degrees C through the inhibition of citrate synthase (CS). Heat stress caused responses were only occasional and transient in antioxidant defence system of both species in the heart and muscle, leading to increased glutathione (GSH) and decreased levels of lipoperoxidation in the heart of both species. The results obtained in this study in the heart and muscles indicate that under heat stress at 8 degrees C, N. rossii is more responsive than N. coriiceps with respect to carbohydrate metabolism.
