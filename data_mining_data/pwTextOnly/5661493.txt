This paper describes some new characteristics of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase CO(2)-oxaloacetate exchange reaction in purified preparations of Rhodospirillum rubrum. The enzymatic activity has been purified 169-fold. Nucleotide diphosphates substitute for nucleotide triphosphates in the exchange reaction. Nucleotide diphosphates will not support the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate. This reaction differs significantly from the CO(2)-oxaloacetate exchange reaction in higher plants and animals.
