The phosphorylation state of six cytoplasmic proteins is increased following treatment of isolated rat hepatocytes with hormones that elevate free intracellular Ca2+ levels (Garrison, J. C. and Wagner, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13135-13143). Tryptic 32P-phosphopeptide maps of two of the substrates, pyruvate kinase and a 49,000-dalton protein, the major 32P-labeled protein in hepatocytes, were prepared following stimulation of cells with vasopressin, a Ca2+-linked hormone. Peptide maps of the 49,000-dalton protein phosphorylated in vitro with the recently identified multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase contained phosphopeptides identical to those observed in the intact cell, suggesting that this kinase is activated in response to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones. Similar in vitro phosphorylation experiments with pyruvate kinase suggested that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate not only the serine residues observed following vasopressin stimulation of the intact cell but also additional threonine residues. Both pyruvate kinase and the 49,000-dalton protein are also phosphorylated in the hepatocyte in response to glucagon and in vitro by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Both vasopressin and glucagon appear to stimulate the phosphorylation of identical serine residues in pyruvate kinase but only vasopressin enhances the phosphorylation of certain sites in the 49,000-dalton protein. Comparison of the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of these substrates phosphorylated in vitro with either the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase suggests that the Ca2+-dependent kinase can phosphorylate unique sites in both substrates. It appears to share specificity at other sites with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Overall, the results suggest that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase plays an important role in the response of the hepatocyte to a Ca2+ signal.
