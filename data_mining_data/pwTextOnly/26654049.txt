Endometriosis is a prevalent health condition in women of reproductive age characterized by ectopic growth of endometrial-like tissue in the extrauterine environment. Thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease is still incomplete. We dissected eutopic and ectopic endometrial primary stromal cell proteomes to a depth of nearly 6900 proteins using quantitative mass spectrometry with a spike-in SILAC standard. Acquired data revealed metabolic reprogramming of ectopic stromal cells with extensive upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of oxidative respiration, a widespread metabolic phenotype known as the Warburg effect and previously described in many cancers. These changes in metabolism are additionally accompanied by attenuated aerobic respiration of ectopic endometrial stromal cells as measured by live-cell oximetry and by altered mRNA levels of respective enzyme complexes. Our results additionally highlight other molecular changes of ectopic endometriotic stromal cells indicating reduced apoptotic potential, increased cellular invasiveness and adhesiveness, and altered immune function. Altogether, these comprehensive proteomics data refine the current understanding of endometriosis pathogenesis and present new avenues for therapies.
