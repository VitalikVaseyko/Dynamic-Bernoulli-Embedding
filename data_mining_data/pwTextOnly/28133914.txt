INTRODUCTION: Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is one of the most common hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemias worldwide with clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe hemolysis. However, investigation of this enzymopathy is lacking in Tunisia. We report here a pioneer investigation of PK deficiency among Tunisian cases referred to our laboratory for biological analysis of unknown cause of hemolytic anemia. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-three patients with unknown cause of hemolytic anemia have been addressed to our laboratory in order to investigate for red blood cells genetic disorders. Red cell enzyme activities were measured by standard methods, and molecular analysis was performed by DNA sequencing. The interpretation of mutation effect and the molecular modeling were performed by using specific software. RESULTS: Six different PKLR mutations were found (c.966-1G>T; c.965+1G>A; c.721G>T; c.1163C>A; c.1456C>T; c.1537T>A), among which four are described for the first time. Genotype-phenotype correlations for the novel missense mutations were investigated by three-dimensional structure analysis. CONCLUSION: This study provides important data of PK deficiency among Tunisians. It might be followed by a large neonatal screening to determine the spectrum of PK mutations and identify potential deficient patients for an early medical follow-up.
