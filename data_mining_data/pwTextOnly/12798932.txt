Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme for the glycolytic pathway and carbon metabolism in general. On the basis of the relevance and enormous diverse properties of this enzyme, this paper describes the results of a current and extensive review that determines the sites of conservation and/or difference in PK sequences, and the differences in the functional and regulatory properties of the enzymes. An alignment and analysis of 50 PK sequences from different sources and a phylogenetic tree are presented. This analysis was performed with reference to crystallographically characterized PK principally from E. coli, cat and rabbit muscle. A number of attributes of the enzyme that make it of particular interest in biomedicine and industry are also discussed.
