The levels of pyruvate kinase (PYK1), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) and phosphoglycerate mutase (GPM1) mRNAs were measured during batch growth and during the yeast-to-hyphal transition in Candida albicans. The four mRNAs behaved in a similar fashion. PYK1, ADH1, PGK1 and GPM1 mRNA levels were shown to increase dramatically during the exponential growth phase of the yeast form, and then to decrease to relatively low levels in the stationary phase. The dimorphic transition was induced using two sets of conditions: (i) an increase in temperature (from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C) combined with the addition of serum to the medium; and (ii) an increase in temperature (from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C) and an increase in pH of the growth medium (from pH 4.5 to pH 6.5). Additional cultures were analysed to control for the addition of serum, and for changes in temperature or pH. Immediately following dilution of late-exponential cells into fresh media the levels of all four glycolytic mRNAs decreased rapidly in contrast to the ACT1 mRNA control, the level of which increased under most conditions. The recovery of glycolytic mRNA levels depended on the culture conditions, but there was no direct correlation with the formation of germ tubes, with the addition of serum to the medium, the increase in culture temperature, the medium pH, or the glucose concentration. This indicates that the changes in glycolytic gene expression that accompany the dimorphic transition in C. albicans reflect the underlying physiological status of the cells during morphogenesis and not alterations to cell shape.
