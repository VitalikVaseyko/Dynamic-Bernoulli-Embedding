Using three methods: histoenzymatic and immunoenzymatic, stained with tetrazolium salt, and immunofluorescence, we have localized PK "L" in hepatocytes. This localization in the cytoplasm of the cells differs widely in intensity with diet or hormone administration. Maximal with animals fed on high carbohydrate diet, still elevated with a subsequent insulin administration, it decreases with a normal diet to become weaker in animals, which have fasted for 48 hrs.
