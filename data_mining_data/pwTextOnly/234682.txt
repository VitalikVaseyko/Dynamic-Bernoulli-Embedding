The activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipoenesis in early and term human placenta was determined. A high activity of pyruvate kinase was found, indicating high glycolytic potential. The activity of this enzyme tended to decrease with gestation. The presence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was detected, suggesting the possibility of gluconeogenesis in the placenta. Very low activity of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis was found, whereas the activity of the pentose shunt pathway enzymes, glucose-6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, was relatively high. This suggested a role of this pathway in the synthesis of lipids other than fatty acids in the placenta. The activities of enzymes in the human placenta and their changes during gestation where compared to previous observations on enzymes in rat placenta.
