Kluyveromyces-like intergeneric hybrids of thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus and non-thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produced in a previous study by protoplasmic fusion, have been characterized. On molasses, these strains produced ethanol in excess of 6% (v/v) both at 30 and 45 degrees C as against 3% and 4.2% (v/v) by the former parent at 30 and 45 degrees C, respectively. In hybrids, the increase in ethanol production appeared to be a sequel to increased activities of alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, derived probably from S. cerevisiae parent. Hybrid ADH-isozyme pattern on polyacrylamide gel corroborated the presence of S. cerevisiae ADH in the tested hybrids. Regression analyses indicated a positive correlation between ethanol production and ADH or PK or both (r approximately 0.76-0.84).
