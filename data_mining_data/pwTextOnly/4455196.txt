Kinetic properties of rat liver pyruvate kinase type I at pH7.5 and 6.5 were studied with physiological ranges of substrates, modifiers and Mg(2+) concentrations at increasing enzyme concentrations, including the estimated cellular concentrations (approx. 0.1mg/ml). Enzyme properties appear unaffected by increased enzyme concentration if phosphoenolpyruvate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate and inhibitors are incubated with enzyme before starting the reaction with ADP. Our data suggest that minimum cellular concentrations of MgATP and l-alanine provide virtually complete inhibition of pyruvate kinase I at pH7.5. The most likely cellular control of existing pyruvate kinase I results from the strong restoration of enzyme activity by the small physiological amounts of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Decreasing the pH to 6.5 also restores pyruvate kinase activity, but to only about one-third of its activity in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Neither pyruvate nor 2-phosphoglycerate at cellular concentrations inhibit the enzyme significantly.
