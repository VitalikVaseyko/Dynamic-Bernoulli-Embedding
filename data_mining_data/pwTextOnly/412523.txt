1. Developmental enzyme alterations were investigated in skeletal muscle of the hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) mice of C57BL/6J strain. 2. Enzymes examined were classified into three groups according to changes of activities in dystrophy muscle during ageing. Activities of creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2), pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1), and fructose-biphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), each of which had the respective muscle specific isoenzyme of extremely high activity in normal adult skeletal muscle, decreased rapidly in dystrophy muscle from the early stage of the disease with ageing. Activities of glycogen synthase (EC 2.4.1.11) and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) were higher in dystrophy muscle in the early stage but decreased gradually to lower levels than those in the control with ageing. Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) were always much higher in dystrophy muscle than in the control, with no relation to ageing. 3. Isoenzymes of creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase and phosphorylase in dystrophy muscle were mainly the muscle types, indicating that muscle differentiation was not blocked profoundly even in dystrophy muscle. In limited cases, especially in the early stage of the disease, very weak activities of the non-muscle fetal type isoenzymes of creatine kinase and phosphorylase were detected, apparently associated with partial muscle regeneration in dystrophy muscle.
