Two rapid methods for fractionating the RBC into five or nine layers of increasing density are reported. These procedures have been used to monitor the decline of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) activity during the process of red cell aging in normal subjects and in beta-thal carriers, to study transfused patients with G6PD and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency and to test the effects of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) encapsulation on RBC subpopulations.
