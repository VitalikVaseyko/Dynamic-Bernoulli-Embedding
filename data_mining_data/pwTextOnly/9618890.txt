The activities of Na+,K(+)-ATPase in plasma membrane, of cytosolic enzymes and of glutamate dehydrogenase (GlGD) in mitochondria were measured in leukocytes (WBC) from dogs and cats to clarify the differences in energy metabolism in these cells. Feline WBC had significantly higher activities of hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and LDH with pyruvate as substrate than did canine WBC. Canine WBC had significantly higher activities of glucokinase (GK) and GlDH than did feline WBC. Feline WBC had unique characteristics of energy metabolism in that the activities of the cytosolic enzymes under anaerobic conditions were significantly higher than those in canine WBC. It therefore appears that there are distinct differences in glucose-metabolism in WBC between dogs and cats. WBC enzyme activities are considered to reflect the metabolic state in the whole body of the animal. It is therefore suggested that changes in the activities of certain glycolytic enzymes in WBC may be useful as a diagnostic indicator in some types of metabolic disease in dogs and cats.
