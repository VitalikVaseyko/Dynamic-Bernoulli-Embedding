A new method for the histochemical demonstration of pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was developed using a semi-permeable membrane and ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose coupled with tetrazolium reduction via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in order to investigate normal liver tissue and neoplastic hepatic nodules induced by thioacetamide (TAA). A series of control reactions and comparison with microbiochemical analysis of microdissected lyophilised material were used to determine the specificity of the reaction. In agreement with earlier reports, an activity gradient in control liver decreasing from zone 3 to zone 1 was apparent both histochemically and after biochemical analysis. Liver neoplastic nodules induced by 25 weeks dietary thioacetamide administration and characterized by increased G6PD demonstrated a clear decrease in PK activity. In contrast, epithelial cells within areas of cholangiocellular tumour development were characterized by a strong increase. Comparison of the results with immunohistochemical and biochemical data from the literature indicate that the specific histochemical method described will be of great assistance in future assessment of disease and physiological alteration in activity of this key enzyme of glycolysis.
