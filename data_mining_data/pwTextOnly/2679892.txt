Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase shows a biphasic decay pattern during red blood cell aging, which is very fast during the first part of cell's life span in circulation. This decay is not due to accumulation of inactive enzyme molecules, as shown by immunological studies, but is accompanied by the formation of secondary isozymes (i.e., chemically modified forms). Electrophoretic and ion-exchange chromatographic experiments show that glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) consists of only one isozymic form in young erythrocytes but is present in two components, with different electric charge, in mature and old cells. This secondary isozyme is more stable to heat treatment and is inactivated by IgG anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase with a lower affinity than the native isozyme. In vitro incubation of homogeneous human glucose-6-phosphate isomerase under conditions known to produce enzyme deamination does not reproduce the isozymic pattern found in erythrocytes, suggesting that one or more mechanisms other than those previously described to explain glucose-6-phosphate isomerase microheterogeneity occur in the human erythrocyte.
