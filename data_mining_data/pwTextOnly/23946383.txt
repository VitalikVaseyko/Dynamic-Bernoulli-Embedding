While metastasis is the chief cause of cancer mortality, there nonetheless remains a lack of antimetastatic therapies that are clinically available. In this study, we present the indirubin derivative 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO) as a promising antimetastatic agent. 6BIO strongly reduced formation of lung metastasis in the well-established 4T1 mouse model of aggressive breast cancer. Several major hallmarks of the metastatic process were affected by subtoxic concentrations of 6BIO, which inhibited adhesion, migration, and invasion of a variety of metastatic cell types in vitro. Mechanistic analyses focused on known targets of 6BIO, which were silenced by this compound. Unexpectedly, RNAi-mediated silencing of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), both modulators of cellular metastasis targeted by 6BIO, were not found to affect invasive migration in this study. Instead, the Jak/STAT3 signaling pathway appeared to play a major role through modulation of its downstream migration regulators C-terminal tensin-like protein and matrix metalloproteinase 2. However, PDK1 and GSK3beta contributed to the overall response to 6BIO, as silencing of all three pathways resulted in almost complete inhibition of migration, phenocopying the 6BIO response. Taken together, our findings illustrate the antimetastatic activity of 6BIO on the basis of its ability to simultaneously inhibit several kinase cascades involved in metastasis of cancer cells, supporting the concept of "polypharmacology" in developing drugs to attack metastasis, the most deadly aspect of cancer.
