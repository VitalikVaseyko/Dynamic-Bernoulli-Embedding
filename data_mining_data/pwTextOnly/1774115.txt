Several key enzymes related to carbohydrate metabolism were assayed in Setaria digitata. In the cytosolic fraction pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were found. Among the TCA cycle enzymes succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, fumarase (malate dehydration), malate dehydrogenase (malate oxidation and oxaloacetate reduction) and malic enzyme (malate decarboxylation) were detected in the mitochondrial fraction. Only reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase, NADH oxidase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase were found in the mitochondrial fraction. The significance of these results with respect to the metabolic capabilities of the worm are discussed.
