When glucose was given to starved rats there was an increase in both 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase and pyruvate kinase activity and a decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity 30 min and 60 min later. These changes were accompanied by an increase in glycogen deposition and by modest, but significant increases in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels at the same time. Metabolite measurements indicated that flux through 6-phosphofructo 1-kinase and pyruvate kinase were increased. These results suggest that although glycogen deposition may occur via the gluconeogenic pathway, glycolysis is activated at the same time by changes in the phosphorylation state of key regulatory enzymes as well as by the small rise in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.
