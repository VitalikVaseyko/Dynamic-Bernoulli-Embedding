Metallothionein 3 (MT-3), also known as growth inhibitory factor (GIF), exhibits a neuroinhibitory activity. Our lab and others have previously shown that this biological activity involves interacting protein partners in the brain. However, nothing specific is yet known about which of these interactions is responsible for the GIF activity. In this paper, we are reporting upon new proteins found interacting with MT-3 as determined through immunoaffinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. These new partner proteins-Exo84p, 14-3-3 Zeta, alpha and beta Enolase, Aldolase C, Malate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, and Pyruvate kinase-along with those previously identified have now been classified into three functional groups: transport and signaling, chaperoning and scaffolding, and glycolytic metabolism. When viewed together, these interactions support a proposed model for the regulation of the GIF activity of MT-3.
