The rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene is transcribed either from promoter L in the liver or promoter L' in erythroid cells. We have now cloned and functionally characterized an erythroid-specific enhancer, mapped in the fetal liver as hypersensitive site B (HSSB) at 3.7 kilobases upstream from the promoter L'. Protein-DNA interactions were examined in the 200-base pair core of the site by in vivo footprinting experiments. In the fetal liver, footprints were revealed at multiple GATA and CACC/GT motifs, whose association is the hallmark of erythroid-specific regulatory sequences. Functional analysis of the HSSB element in transgenic mice revealed properties of a cell-restricted enhancer. Indeed, this element was able to activate the linked ubiquitous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in erythroid tissues. The activation was also observed in a variety of nonerythroid tissues known to synthesize GATA-binding factors. In the context of L'-PK transgenes, HSSB was not needed for an erythroid-specific activation of the L' promoter, while it was required to stimulate the L' promoter activity to a proper level. Finally, HSSB cannot be replaced by strong ubiquitous viral or cellular enhancers, suggesting a preferential interaction of the HSSB region with the L' promoter.
