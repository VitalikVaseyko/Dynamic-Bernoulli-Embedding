Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy was used to study in real time under nearly physiological conditions the equilibration and exchange characteristics of several different fluorescently labeled molecules into chemically skinned, unfixed skeletal muscle fibers of rabbit psoas. The time required for equilibration was found to vary widely from a few minutes up to several days. Specific interactions of molecules with myofibrillar structures seem to slow down equilibration significantly. Time for equilibration, therefore, cannot simply be predicted from diffusion parameters in solution. Specific interactions resulted in characteristic labeling patterns for molecules like creatine kinase (muscle type), pyruvate kinase, actin-binding IgG, and others. For the very slowly equilibrating Rh-NEM-S1, changes in affinity upon binding to actin in the absence of calcium and subsequent slow cooperative activation, beginning at the free end of the filament at the H-zone, were observed. In the presence of calcium, however, binding of Rh-NEM-S1 was homogeneous along the whole actin filament from the very beginning of equilibration. The dissociation properties of the dynamic interactions were analyzed using a chase protocol. Even molecules that bind with rather high affinity and that can be removed only by applying extreme experimental conditions like Rh-phalloidine or Rh-troponin could be displaced easily by unlabeled homologous molecules.
