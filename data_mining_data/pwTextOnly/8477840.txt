Despite significant increases in circulating concentrations of lipid fuels (triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and ketone bodies) in late-pregnant rats sampled in the fed (absorptive) state, cardiac and skeletal muscle active pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) activities remained comparable with those observed in fed, age-matched virgin controls. Cardiac PDHa activity was suppressed in response to acute (6 h) starvation in late-pregnant (as well as virgin) rats: this inactivation was opposed by inhibition of mitochondrial long-chain FA oxidation. Starvation (6 h) also led to PDH inactivation in skeletal muscles of late-pregnant, but not virgin, rats. Starvation for 24 h led to further suppression of cardiac PDHa activity and was associated with significant increases in PDH kinase activities in both virgin and late-pregnant rats. Late pregnancy did not itself influence cardiac PDH kinase activity.
