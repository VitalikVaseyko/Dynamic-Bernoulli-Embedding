Novel erythrocyte pyruvate kinase gene defects were found in a patient without a family history of consanguinity. The polymerase chain reaction products of the R-type pyruvate kinase cDNA from the propositus contained two point mutations of Ser80 (TCC)-->Pro (CCC) and Arg490 (CGG)-->Trp (TGG). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction of the genomic DNA revealed that this patient was a compound heterozygote. The mobilities of the patient's L- and R-type pyruvate kinase by thin-layer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were abnormal. The results are consistent with the fact that these mutations are within exons common to the hepatic and erythrocyte isozymes.
