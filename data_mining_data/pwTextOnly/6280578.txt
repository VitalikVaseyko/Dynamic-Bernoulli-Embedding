In order to evaluate properly red cell metabolic data obtained in newborns with congenital hemolytic disorders, the unique metabolic characteristics and normal developmental changes that occur prenatally and postnatally are presented. The age-dependent red cell glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and most glycolytic intermediates are elevated at birth and at 11 to 12 months of age, consistent with the presence of a young red cell population the entire first year of life. However, certain red cell enzymes are elevated out of proportion to the age of the red cell population [phosphoglucose isomerase. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and enolase (ENO)] whereas others are decreased [phosphofructokinase (PFK), glutathione peroxidase, carbonic anhydrase, and others]. These metabolic characteristics are felt to be unique and representative of "fetal erythropoiesis." Activities of PGK and ENO decrease the PFK increases toward normal adult values beginning at eight to nine weeks of age. The concentration of glucose-6-phosphate steadily increases after birth and peaks at three to four weeks of age, at a time when PFK activity remains relatively unchanged, suggesting a relative block in glycolysis at the PFK step secondary to an enzyme with both decreased activity and altered kinetic properties (a "fetal" isozyme). Thus, evaluation of red cell enzyme and glycolytic intermediate data obtained in the first year of life should be related to the knowledge that a young red cell population is present and the characteristic unique metabolic red cell alterations described in cord blood persist beyond the immediate neonatal period.
