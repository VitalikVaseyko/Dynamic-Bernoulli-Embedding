The proteins of the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction of cerebral cortex were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and more than 30 proteins identified by characteristic 2DE mobility, immunoblotting with specific antibodies, and N-terminal and peptide sequencing. The PSD fraction is enriched for spectrin, actin, tublin and microtubule associated protein II, myosin, enzymes of glycolysis, creatine kinase, elongation factor 1 alpha, and receptor protein. The three neurofilament proteins are detected but a 58-kDa protein is prominent and is, by peptide sequencing, the bovine homolog of the recently cloned 66-kDa neurofilament protein; in contrast to the latter, however, it is enriched in cerebrum compared with spinal cord. A 68-kDa protein is identified as a member of the hsp70/BiP family of proteins. A protein, designated dynamin, indicating its putative role as a microtubule motor, is identified as a major protein, is found, however, greatly enriched in the particulate fraction, and is significantly denaturant and detergent insoluble. A protein designated N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor is also detected. Thus, two proteins implicated in vesicular transport are present in the PSD fraction. Seven polyclonal antibodies were produced to 2DE separated and electroeluted proteins of the PSD and were identified by peptide sequence analysis and 2DE profile as the hsp70/BiP homologous protein, the novel neurofilament protein synapsin IIa, pyruvate kinase, dynamin, aconitase and an unknown contaminating protein, and a 115-kDa protein that by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting is a diagnostic PSD molecule. In addition, peptide sequences are obtained for four additional higher molecular weight proteins of the PSD that are not related at the level of primary structure to any known proteins.
