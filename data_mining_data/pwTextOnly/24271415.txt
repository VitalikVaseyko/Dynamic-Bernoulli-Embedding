Bulk-prepared neuronal perikarya and glial fractions have been used to study developmental changes of some enzymic activities concerning glycolysis and synthesis of neurotransmitters. Somewhat higher pyruvate kinase activity was found in neuronal perikarya than in glial cells, and its rapid rise was observed during early developmental stages. Increased K(+) concentration orD-glutamate addition to the incubation medium enhanced consumption of phosphoenolpyruvate. This activation of the enzyme was small just after birth, but it increased in parallel with development to adult level, where the activation in glial fractions was over twice that in neuronal fractions. Choline acetyltransferase activity was found in purified neuronal fractions and increased with age; glutamate decarboxylase was also found in high activity in purified neuronal fractions and increased with development. However, some enzymic activities were also found in glial fractions, and possibilities of contamination by synaptosomal, myelin, or other subfractions are discussed.
