The effects of intravenous salmon calcitonin on tissue carbohydrate and redox metabolism were studied in rat kidney in situ and were compared to the effects of EGTA infusion. Calcitonin (0.8 MRC U, in bous) caused, after 10-20 min, a reductive shift of the cytosolic NAD redox pair, and an oxidative shift of the mitochondrial NAD redox pair. It also caused a stimulation of glycolysis with the cross-over between phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate. These results were reproduced by treatments of hypocalcemia with EGTA or with thyroparathyroidectomy. Most of the effects were opposite in direction to the reported effects of CaCl2 and parathyroid hormone. The above results suggest that in kidney calcitonin causes a stimulation of pyruvate kinase, and/or inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and that the effects are related to changes in the intracellular calcium.
