Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) deregulation contributes to the Warburg effect. HIF consists of an unstable alpha subunit and a stable beta subunit. In the presence of oxygen, HIFalpha becomes prolyl hydroxylated by members of the EglN (also called PHD) family, leading to its proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, EglN activity is diminished and HIF levels rise. EglN1 is the primary HIF prolyl hydroxylase with EglN2 and EglN3 playing compensatory roles under certain conditions. EglN2 and EglN3 also appear to play HIF-independent roles in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The EglNs belong to a large family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that includes the TET DNA hydroxymethylases and JmjC-containing histone demethylases. Members of this superfamily can be inhibited by endogenous metabolites, including fumarate and succinate, which accumulate in tumors that have fumarate hydratase (FH) or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, respectively, as well as by the 2-hydroxyglutarate detected in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant tumors. 2-Oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases therefore provide a link between altered metabolism and cancer.
