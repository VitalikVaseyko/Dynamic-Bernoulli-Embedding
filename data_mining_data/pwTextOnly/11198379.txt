High glycolytic flux as an emergency pathway for generating ATP was recorded as the most important metabolic pathway required for the success of Biomphalaria-Schistosome sporocyst interaction. Effect of LC25 of dry powdered Ambrosia maritima (Damsissa) as plant molluscicide on hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase(PK), glucose phosphate isomerase(GPI) was tested. It resulted in a significant inhibition of the three investigated enzymes. Treatment of snails with LC10 concentrations of A. maritima reduced considerably the infection rate of Biomphalaria alexandrina with Schistosoma mansoni to be 34% compared to an infection rate of 80% in control non-treated snails. Longer prepatent period and remarkable decrease in cercarial production was also recorded in snails treated with the sublethal concentrations of this molluscicide.
