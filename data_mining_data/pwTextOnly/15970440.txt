The isoflavones--genistein and daidzein -- compounds found in high concentrations in soy play an important role in prevention of many diseases and affect some metabolic pathways. In the performed experiment it was demonstrated that genistein (5mg/kg b.w.) administered intragastrically for three days to male Wistar rats substantially diminished blood leptin level. Studies with isolated rat adipocytes revealed that this phytoestrogen strongly restricted leptin secretion from these cells. These effects were not accompanied by any changes in leptin gene expression in adipocytes. Daidzein-- an analogue of genistein -- used at similar concentrations did not affect blood leptin concentration, leptin secretion and expression of its gene. To determine the influence of genistein and daidzein on leptin release, adipocytes isolated from the epididymal fat tissue were incubated for 2h in Krebs--Ringer buffer. Leptin secretion stimulated by glucose with insulin was significantly diminished by genistein (0.25--1mM). This effect of genistein may arise from several aspects of its action in adipocytes documented in the literature such as the inhibition of glucose transport and metabolism, the attenuation of insulin signalling, the inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase and the stimulation of lipolysis. However, the bypassing of the restrictive action of genistein on glucose transport and glycolysis (by the use of alanine instead of glucose) and on insulin action (by the use of nicotinic acid) was not sufficient to restore leptin secretion from isolated adipocytes. It was also demonstrated that the restriction of the stimulatory influence of genistein on cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway (by the inhibition of PKA activity) did not improve leptin release. Results obtained in our experiments point at the restriction of glucose metabolism following formation of pyruvate as the pivotal reason of the inhibitory action of genistein on leptin release.
