Genotypically different host specific pathotypes of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus have been identified. These pathotypes elicit different responses in pines depending on susceptibility, tolerance, or resistance. Continued passage of some of these pathotypes on fungal cultures leads to conversion to nonparasitic populations. These populations metabolize carbon substrates to ethanol by an anaerobic pathway, while operating some level of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-succinate pathway to excrete succinate-lactate and malate. On the other hand, parasitic populations metabolize glucose to lactate-succinate, mainly by a PEP-succinate pathway, and maintain redox balance through glycerol production. Ethanol and malate are not excreted by parasitic populations.
