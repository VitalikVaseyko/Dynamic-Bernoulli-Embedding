In the present work we found a significant increase of erythrocyte HK activity in subjects suffering from differentiated adenocarcinoma. Some erythrocyte enzymatic activities (such as HK, PK, G-6-PD, 6-PGD, PHI and GR) in the red blood cells of 96 subjects, of which 55 were healthy or with noncancerous pathology and 41 had malignant tumors, are considered. Evident modification was shown only for the HK, which together with PFK and PK are limiting steps of glycolysis.
