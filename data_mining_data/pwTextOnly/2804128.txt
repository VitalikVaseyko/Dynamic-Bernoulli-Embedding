This paper reports the pH-dependence of the allosteric kinetics of Phycomyces blakeseeanus pyruvate kinase with phosphoenol pyruvate and Mg2+ ions in the presence and in the absence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (allosteric activator) and L-alanine (allosteric inhibitor). Hydrogen ions increase the affinity of the inhibitory binding sites for phosphoenol pyruvate and Mg2+ ions. Assuming partial conformational states of high and low affinity for inhibitory binding sites, the data presented are in good agreement with the predictions postulated by the two-state concerted-symmetry model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and L-alanine show opposite effects on the interactions of phosphoenol pyruvate and Mg2+ ions with their respective catalytic and inhibitory binding sites. At pH 6.0, the regulation of the Phycomyces pyruvate kinase activity by the concentrations of phosphoenol pyruvate and Mg2+ ions is controlled mainly by L-alanine.
