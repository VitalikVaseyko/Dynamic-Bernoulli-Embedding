OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders (MDs) is occasionally difficult because patients often present with solitary, or a combination of, symptoms caused by each organ insufficiency, which may be the result of respiratory chain enzyme deficiency. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) has been reported to be elevated in serum of patients with MDs. In this study, we investigated whether GDF-15 is a more useful biomarker for MDs than several conventional biomarkers. METHODS: We measured the serum levels of GDF-15 and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), as well as other biomarkers, in 48 MD patients and in 146 healthy controls in Japan. GDF-15 and FGF-21 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and compared with lactate, pyruvate, creatine kinase, and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and also evaluated the correlation based on two rating scales, including the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Rating Scale (NMDAS). RESULTS: Mean GDF-15 concentration was 6-fold higher in MD patients compared to healthy controls (2,711 +/- 2,459 pg/ml vs 462.5 +/- 141.0 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the curve was significantly higher for GDF-15 than FGF-21 and other conventional biomarkers. Our date suggest that GDF-15 is the most useful biomarker for MDs of the biomarkers examined, and it is associated with MD severity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that measurement of GDF-15 is the most useful first-line test to indicate the patients who have the mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency.
