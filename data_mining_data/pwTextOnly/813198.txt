By the Warburg manometric method the respiratory activity of the caprolactam destructors--Bacillus subtilis strains 6 and 21 was measured. The bacteria grown on the synthetic nutrient medium with caprolactam as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen oxidized that substrate more intensively than the cells grown on meat-peptone agar. The activity of caprolactam oxidation by the cultures showed strain differences. Clay minerals--montmorillonit, palygorskit, bentonit and vermiculit--stimulated the glucose and caprolactam oxidation by the above bacteria. The highest stimulating effect was produced by montmorillonit.
