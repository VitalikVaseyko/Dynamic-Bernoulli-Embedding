A hallmark of cancer cells is the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis, a phenomenon referred to as the 'Warburg effect', which is also observed in primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here, we report that downregulation of SIRT2 and upregulation of SIRT1 is a molecular signature of primed hPSCs and that SIRT2 critically regulates metabolic reprogramming during induced pluripotency by targeting glycolytic enzymes including aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase. Remarkably, knockdown of SIRT2 in human fibroblasts resulted in significantly decreased OXPHOS and increased glycolysis. In addition, we found that miR-200c-5p specifically targets SIRT2, downregulating its expression. Furthermore, SIRT2 overexpression in hPSCs significantly affected energy metabolism, altering stem cell functions such as pluripotent differentiation properties. Taken together, our results identify the miR-200c-SIRT2 axis as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming (Warburg-like effect), via regulation of glycolytic enzymes, during human induced pluripotency and pluripotent stem cell function.
