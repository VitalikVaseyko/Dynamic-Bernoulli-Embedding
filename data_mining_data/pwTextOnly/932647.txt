The rate of distribution of cell enzymes between the intravascular and extravascular space was studied, following a sudden decrease of enzyme activities in plasma. This rapid decrease of enzyme activities was achieved in rats by a rapid exchange of the blood with a twofold volume of a suspension of homologous erythrocytes in isoosmolar bovine serum albumin solution. After this plasmapheresis, the activities of seven cell enzymes in the plasma were decreased to 14 to 22% of their original values. The subsequent increase in activities showed different kinetics, depending on the enzyme. After 120 min, creatine kinase had reached the starting activity; malate dehydrogenase and aldolase reached their original activities after 180 min. Aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and pyruvate kinase increased more slowly and they had still not reached their starting values after 240 min. Repetition of the plasmapheresis after 90 min had no obvious effect on the kinetics of the subsequent activity increase. During the first minutes after plasmapheresis the adjustment of the activity equilibrium between the interstitial and the intravascular compartments depends mainly on the capillary permeability. It is therefore possible to determine half-life constants for the distribution of enzymes within the extracellular space. The constants for malate dehydrogenase and aldolase are almost identical with those determined by intravenous injection, whereas there are discrepancies in the constants for the remaining enzymes. The constants for pyruvate kinase and glutamate dehydrogenase are significantly lower, while those for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase are significantly higher, than those determined after intravenous injection. Possible reasons for these differences are disucssed.
