We have investigated the signalling pathways involved in the stimulation of glycogen and fatty acid synthesis by insulin in rat fat cells using wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and rapamycin, which blocks activation of p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). Insulin produced a decrease in the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 which is likely to be important in the observed stimulation of glycogen synthase. Both of these actions were found to be sensitive to inhibition by wortmannin. Activation of three processes is involved in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis from glucose by insulin, namely glucose uptake, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Whereas wortmannin largely abolished the effects of insulin on glucose utilization and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, it was without effect on the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Although epidermal growth factor stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase to a greater extent than insulin, it was unable to mimic the effect of insulin on glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase-3, glucose utilization, acetyl-CoA carboxylase or pyruvate dehydrogenase. Rapamycin also failed to have any appreciable effect on stimulation of these parameters by insulin, although it did block the effect of insulin on p70S6K. We conclude that the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for the effects of insulin on glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake and acetyl-Co-AN carboxylase, but is not involved in signalling to pyruvate dehydrogenase. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or p70S6K, however, does not appear to be sufficient to bring about the stimulation of fatty acid or glycogen synthesis. Altogether is seems likely that at least four distinct signalling pathways are involved in the effects of insulin on rat fat cells.
