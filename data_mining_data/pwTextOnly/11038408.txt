Glycolytic fibres in rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tibialis anterior (TA) were selectively activated, as demonstrated by glycogen depletion, by indirect electrical stimulation via electrodes implanted in the vicinity of the peroneal nerve using high frequency (40 Hz) trains (250 ms at 1 Hz) and low voltage (threshold of palpable contractions). This regime was applied 10 times per day, each bout being of 15 min duration with 60 min recovery, for 2 weeks. Cryostat sections of muscles were stained for alkaline phosphatase to depict capillaries, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to demonstrate oxidative fibres, and periodic acid-Schiff reagent (PAS) to verify glycogen depletion. Specific activity of hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) were estimated separately in homogenates of the EDL and the predominantly glycolytic cortex and oxidative core of the TA. Stimulation increased the activity of HK but not that of oxidative enzymes in fast muscles. Comparison of changes in oxidative capacity and capillary supply showed a dissociation in the predominantly glycolytic TA cortex. Here, COX was 3.9+/-0.68 microM min(-1) (g wet wt)-1 in stimulated muscles compared with 3.7+/-0.52 microM min(-1) (g wet wt)-1 in contralateral muscles (difference not significant), while the percentage of oxidative fibres (those positively stained for SDH) was also similar in stimulated (14.0+/-2.8 %) and contralateral (12.2 +/-1.9 %) muscles. In contrast, the capillary to fibre ratio was significantly increased (2.01+/-0.12 vs. 1.55+/-0.04, P<0.01). We conclude that capillary supply can be increased independently of oxidative capacity, possibly due to haemodynamic factors, and serves metabolite removal to a greater extent than substrate delivery.
