The toxic effect of the metal ions of cadmium, zinc, nickel and mercury and their tetracyanide salt complexes, on the activated sludge not previously acclimated, has been studied. The evaluation of the effect was carried out using both the Warburg and TTC-method. The results obtained have shown that the toxicity of the cadmium and zinc complexes is higher than that of the corresponding metals, while the toxicity of Ni(CN)4(2-) is lower than that of the corresponding metals. No differences have been found between the effect of mercury and the corresponding tetracyanide complex. From the data obtained it appears that it is not possible to generalize about the biological effect of complexation with the CN- group, but it should be stated that, generally, there are substantial differences between metals and their cyanide complexes as far as toxicity for activated sludge is concerned.
