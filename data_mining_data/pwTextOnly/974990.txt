Activities of glucosephosphate isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase, and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase were significantly elevated in breast cancer specimens from patients who responded favorably to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens compared with those in carcinomas from patients failing to respond to the same chemotherapy. Presence of estrogen receptors and clinical response to hormonal therapy were also evaluated in neoplasms from these patients. The data suggest that measurement of the enzyme profile, along with estrogen receptor levels, may be useful in selecting a mode of therapy for patients with advanced disease.
