Pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient RBCs have several unexplained metabolic abnormalities, such as decreased concentrations of total adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP) and total (oxidized and reduced) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Because 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an intermediate in the synthesis of adenine nucleotides and NAD, we investigated PRPP synthetase (PRPPS), the enzyme responsible for PRPP synthesis. This enzyme is regulated, in part, by changes in its state of subunit aggregation. The proportion of aggregated PRPPS can be altered in vitro by ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). Because PK-deficient RBCs have decreased ATP and increased DPG concentrations, we examined the state of subunit aggregation of PRPPS in RBCs from normal and PK-deficient subjects, using gel permeation chromatography. Young normal RBCs have more aggregated PRPPS than do older RBCs. In contrast, due to their decreased ATP and increased DPG concentrations, PK-deficient RBCs contain less aggregated PRPPS than do RBCs of comparable age without PK deficiency. These data suggest that PRPPS should be less active in vivo in PK-deficient RBCs. This may play a key role in mediating the decreases in total adenine nucleotide and total NAD concentrations in these RBCs.
