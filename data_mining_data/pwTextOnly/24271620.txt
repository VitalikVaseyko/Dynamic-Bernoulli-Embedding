The maximum extractable activities of twenty-one photosynthetic and glycolytic enzymes were measured in mature leaves of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum plants, grown under a 12 h light 12 h dark photoperiod, exhibiting photosynthetic characteristics of either a C3 or a Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant. Following the change from C3 photosynthesis to CAM in response to an increase in the salinity of in the rooting medium from 100 mM to 400 mM NaCl, the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) increased about 45-fold and the activities of NADP malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) and NAD malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.38) increased about 4- to 10-fold. Pyruvate, Pi dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1) was not detected in the non-CAM tissue but was present in the CAM tissue; PEP carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32) was detected in neither tissue. The induction of CAM was also accompanied by large increases in the activities of the glycolytic enzymes enolase (EC 4.2.1.11), phosphoglyceromutase (EC 2.7.5.3), phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3), NAD glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12), and glucosephosphate isomerase (EC 2.6.1.2). There were 1.5- to 2-fold increases in the activities of NAD malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (EC 2.6.1.2 and 2.6.1.1 respectively) and NADP glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13). The activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11), phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.2) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) remained relatively constant. NADP malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.82) activity exhibited two pH optima in the non-CAM tissue, one at pH 6.0 and a second at pH 8.0. The activity at pH 8.0 increased as CAM was induced. With the exceptions of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the activities of all enzymes examined in extracts from M. crystallinum exhibiting CAM were equal to, or greater than, those required to sustain the maximum rates of carbon flow during acidification and deacidification observed in vivo. There was no day-night variation in the maximum extractable activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, NADP malic enzyme, NAD malic enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and NADP malate dehydrogenase in leaves of M. crystallinum undergoing CAM.
