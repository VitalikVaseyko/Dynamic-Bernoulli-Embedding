This study was conducted to determine the effect of different stress factors on some physiological measurements of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). A total number of 160 Nile tilapia, the body weight ranging between 100 and 120 g, were exposed to three stress factors of hypoxia, overcrowding and starvation for different periods 24, 72 and 144 h. The results of cortisol level were 134.15, 144.27, 154.12 ng/ml and 140.18 ng/ml for control, hypoxia, overcrowding and starvation, respectively, while after 144 h did not show significant difference among treatments compared with control group. In contrast, the values of T3 and T4 observed reduction with significant difference that T3 ranged between the highest value 122.12 ng/ml for control group to lowest value of starvation group 94.35, 93.81 and 88.46 ng/ml after 24, 72 and 144 h. Also, similar trend of results observed in T4 and blood glucose among treatments. And the enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenise (LDH) increased in hypoxic group, while a significant reduction appeared in overcrowding and starved fish compared to control group. The pyruvate kinase (PK) activity decreased in hypoxic group but increased in other group.
