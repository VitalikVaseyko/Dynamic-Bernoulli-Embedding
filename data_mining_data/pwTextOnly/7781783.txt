An MMLV-based retroviral vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene under the control of a glucose-dependent internal promoter derived from the L-type pyruvate kinase gene was constructed. After transfection into psi-CRIP packaging cells, clones producing recombinant retrovirus were selected. These retroviruses were used to infect cultured established hepatocytic cells whose endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase gene is transcriptionally regulated by glucose. In the infected cells, the reporter gene was as responsive to glucose as the endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase gene, and the glucose gene activation was time- and concentration-dependent. The possibility to confer a glucose responsiveness on a transgene carried by a retroviral vector provides a powerful tool in the prospect of gene therapy for diabetes mellitus.
