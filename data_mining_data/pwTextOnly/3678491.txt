The different turnover rates of rat liver mitochondrial enzymes make autophagy unlikely to be the main mechanism for degradation of mitochondria. Although alternatives have been presented, hepatocyte heterogeneity has not been considered. Lighter hepatocytes isolated in a discontinuous Percoll gradient contain more glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (half-life 1 day) and a more active autophagic system than heavier hepatocytes. The latter contain more carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPS) and ornithine carbamoyl transferase (OTC) (half-lives 8 days) but less lysosomal activity. As expected, isolated autophagic vacuoles contain, relative to the mitochondrial content, 3-times less OTC and CPS than GDH, probably reflecting a faster lysosomal engulfment of mitochondria in the light hepatocytes (which contain more GDH). These data may explain some of the half-life differences of the enzymes studied.
