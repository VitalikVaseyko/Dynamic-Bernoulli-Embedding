The AMP-activated pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from Escherichia coli has been purified 200 times through a three-step procedure which gives a homogeneous preparation with a specific activity of 110. The enzyme appears to be a tetramer of molecular weight 190 000. Subunits (molecular weight 51 000) show a single amino-terminal amino acid (serine) and appear as a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate. The enzyme crystallizes in conditions of reduced dielectric constant of the solvent in the pH range 6.5-7.5. Kinetic and regulatory properties of the purified enzyme are similar to those described for crude preparations of the enzyme.
