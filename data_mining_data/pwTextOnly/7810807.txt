Leishmania parasites isolated from two patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis from geographically different localities in Paraguay have been characterized by enzyme electrophoresis (zymodeme) and digestion profiles of kinetoplast DNA with restriction enzymes (schizodeme). Both Paraguayan isolates showed identical zymodeme profiles to each other using 14 enzymes (glutamic pyruvate transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, enolase, fumarate hydratase, glucose phosphate isomerase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, mannose phosphate isomerase, nucleoside phosphorylase, peptidase-D, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, and pyruvate kinase). Although two Paraguayan isolates showed different zymodeme profiles from those of six Leishmania reference strains of Old and New World Leishmania species, they showed identical zymodeme profiles to those of an L. major-like parasite from Ecuador. These observations were confirmed by schizodeme analysis using three restriction endonucleases (Msp I, Hae III, and Taq I). These results indicate that Leishmania parasites isolated in Paraguay are identified as an L. major-like parasite, and it is necessary to consider the existence of L. major-like parasites when classifying Leishmania isolates from the New World.
