1. The effects of purified diets containing 70% glucose or 70% fructose on the activation state of hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa), activity of mitochondrial PDH kinase, plasma triacylglycerols (TG) and hepatic lipogenesis de novo in rats were measured. 2. Plasma TG were significantly increased in the fructose-fed compared with the glucose-fed group (125 +/- 45 mg/dl versus 57 +/- 19 mg/dl; P less than 0.002) after 3-5 weeks on the diet despite less daily food intake. 3. Hepatic PDHa in fructose-fed rats was 144% of the value in glucose-fed rats (15.4 +/- 1.2% versus 10.7 +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.002), whereas cardiac muscle PDHa was not different (45.5 +/- 6.6% versus 41.0 +/- 7.8%). 4. Intrinsic hepatic PDH kinase activity was decreased to 34% of glucose-fed values by fructose feeding (-k = 3.56 +/- 0.39 versus 10.41 +/- 1.85 min-1; P less than 0.005). 5. The fractional contribution to very-low-density-lipoprotein palmitate from hepatic lipogenesis de novo, measured by a stable-isotope mass-spectrometric method, was 10.49 +/- 2.42% (n = 8) in fructose-fed rats versus 5.55 +/- 1.38% (n = 9) in glucose-fed rats (P less than 0.05), and 2.66 +/- 2.39% (n = 3) in chow-fed rats (P less than 0.05 versus fructose-fed group). The absolute contribution to circulating TG from lipogenesis de novo was also significantly higher in the fructose-fed than in the glucose-fed group (14.9 +/- 5.1 mg/dl versus 2.9 +/- 0.6 mg/dl; P less than 0.05) 6. Portal insulin concentrations were significantly higher in the fructose-fed rats (206 +/- 49 mu-units/ml versus 81 +/- 15 mu-units/ml; P less than 0.05). 7. In conclusion, dietary fructose appears to have a specific activating effect on hepatic PDH, mediated at least in part by inhibition of PDH kinase. These results are consistent with increased flux through hepatic PDH and synthesis of new fat, not just increased re-esterification of non-esterified fatty acids.
