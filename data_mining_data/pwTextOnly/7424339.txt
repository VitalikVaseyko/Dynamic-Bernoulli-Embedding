Improvements of the chamber analysis directed to increase the sensitivity by introduction of fluorescence assays, to facilitate the handling of the procedure and to increase the accuracy by introduction of automatic data processing and partially automatized volume dispensing for 50 microliter volumes simultaneously are described. The method is used for measuring of enzyme activities and substrate concentrations in 2--30 microliter sample volumes with final assay volumes lower than 100 microliter. Two variants of the procedure are presented. With variant I all steps of the analysis including start of the reaction by mixing, incubation and measuring are carried out in the measuring chamber. With variant II the measuring chamber is used for the measuring process only, the other steps are performed outside in special chambers. Application examples from biochemical and clinical chemical analysis are demonstrated.
