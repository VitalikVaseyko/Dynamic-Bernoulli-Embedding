We previously observed downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-related protein, TMEM70, which is suggestive of disrupted cellular senescence, in GST-P-expressing (+) proliferative lesions from early hepatocarcinogenesis stages in rats. The present study investigated the immunohistochemical relationship between TMEM70 downregulation and cellular metabolic changes in carcinogenic processes, as well as the onset of the liver cell respiratory changes after repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment in rats. At the early hepatocarcinogenesis stage in a 2-stage model, GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions showing TMEM70 downregulation also downregulated the mitochondrial ATPase, ATPB, but upregulated glycolysis-related glucose transporter member 1 (GLUT1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect. Combined downregulation of TMEM70 and ATPB increased proliferation activity in GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions, suggesting cell proliferation facilitation by reducing mitochondrial respiration. Concurrent GLUT1-upregulation and TMEM70-downregulation increased nuclear phosphorylated c-MYC+ cells in GST-P+ preneoplastic lesions, suggesting c-MYC-mediated transcription facilitation to promote glycolysis and cell proliferation. The TMEM70-related metabolic shift was enhanced in GST-P+ neoplastic lesions, suggesting a contribution to tumor progression. Conversely, the TMEM70-related metabolic shift was lacking in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, as well as in carcinogenic processes targeting other organs. Transcript expression analysis following 28- and 90-day repeated hepatocarcinogen treatment showed downregulation of Tmem70 from day 28 and upregulation of Pkm and Myc at day 90, suggesting early onset of a catastrophic cellular senescence-related metabolic shift beginning from depressed mitochondrial respiration in the liver. These results suggest a contribution of TMEM70 downregulation to the Warburg effect, which directs tumor promotion and progression in GST-P+-linked hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.
