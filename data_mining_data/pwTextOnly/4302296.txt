Crude extracts of both vegetative cells and glycerol-induced microcysts of Myxococcus xanthus contained the following enzyme activities: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, fructosediphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, and uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase. With the exception of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which was present at a fivefold higher concentration in microcysts, all activities in extracts from both types of cells were essentially equal. Hexokinase and pyruvate kinase could not be detected in extracts from either type of cell. Microcysts metabolized acetate at a lower rate than did vegetative cells. Most of this decrease was reflected in a substantial decrease in ability of microcysts to oxidize acetate to CO(2). In addition, microcysts and vegetative cells showed a different distribution of (14)C-label from incorporated acetate.
