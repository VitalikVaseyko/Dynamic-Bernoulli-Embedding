Rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA was enriched from total polysomes by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody and Staphylococcus aureus cells. Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from the enriched mRNA was inserted into the PstI site of pBR322, and the resultant recombinant DNA molecules were used to transform Escherichia coli. Three clones containing DNA complementary to L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA were identified by colony hybridization, hybrid-selected translation, and dot blot hybridization. A partial restriction endonuclease map of cDNA inserts was constructed covering about 1.86 kilobase pairs. The cDNA insert of recombinant plasmid pLPK-14 was used as a hybridization probe to quantitate L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA in rat liver after various treatments. The level of hybridizable L-type enzyme mRNA was markedly increased by a high carbohydrate diet. Diabetes greatly reduced the mRNA level in the liver of rats maintained on a high carbohydrate diet, but insulin administration resulted in restoration of the mRNA level to normal within 24 h. These changes were approximately proportional to the changes in the level of translatable L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA. Thus, we conclude that nutritional and hormonal regulation of synthesis of hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase occurs at the pretranslational level.
