In primary culture of adult rat hepatocytes, vanadate in the presence of glucose stimulates the expression of the liver (L-type) pyruvate kinase gene. Glucose by itself was inactive, and vanadate, like insulin, was also inefficient in the absence of glucose. Similar results were obtained on glucokinase gene expression. An analogue of cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, inhibited the production of L-type pyruvate kinase and glucokinase mRNAs in the presence of glucose plus vanadate.
