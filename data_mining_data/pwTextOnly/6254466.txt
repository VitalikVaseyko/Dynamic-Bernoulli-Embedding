The activities of key enzymes of glycolysis and of the glucose shunt as well as the capacity of lactic acid formation were determined in the high-speed tissue supernatant of the transplantable Albert hepatoma of mouse [originally produced by oral application of chrysoidin (2,4-diaminoazobenzene) on C57 Black mice]. Furthermore, the particle-bound hexokinase activity was determined. The following results were obtained: In the hepatoma the activities of aldolase, pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase are hardly altered compared with normal liver. The activities of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase are increased 2,5-fold, those of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 2-fold. The capacity for lactic acid formation from glucose is 7 times as high in the hepatoma supernatant. Strong differences emerge from the liver-to-hepatoma relationship in terms of intracellular distribution of the hexokinase (total homogenate 1 : 5, supernatant 1 : 2,5 and particle-bound hexokinase activity 1 : 18). A summarizing consideration of all the results obtained so far for the Albert hepatoma shows that this malignoma departss in several biochemical parameters from the "Molecular Correlation Concept" maintained by Weber, providing more evidence for the individuality of tumors.
