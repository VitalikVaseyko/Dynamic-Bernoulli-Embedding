Various attempts have been made to enhance lysine production in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Pyruvate kinase (PYK) defect is one of the strategies used to enhance the supply of oxaloacetic acid (OAA), a precursor metabolite for lysine biosynthesis. However, inconsistent effects of this mutation have been reported: positive effects of PYK defect in mutants having phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) desensitized to feedback inhibition by aspartic acid, while negative effects in simple PYK gene (pyk) knockout mutants. To address these discrepancies, the effects of pyk deletion on lysine yield were investigated with or without the D299N mutation in ppc rendering PEPC desensitization. C. glutamicum ATCC13032 mutant strain P with a feedback inhibition-desensitized aspartokinase was used as the parent strain, producing 9.36 g/L lysine from 100 g/L glucose in a jar fermentor culture. Under these conditions, while the simple mutant D2 with pyk deletion or R2 with the PEPC-desensitization mutation showed marginally increased lysine yield ( approximately 1.1-fold, not significant), the mutant DR2 strain having both mutations showed synergistically increased lysine productivity (1.38-fold, 12.9 g/L). Therefore, the pyk deletion is effective under a PEPC-desensitized background, which ensures enhanced supply of OAA, thus clarifying the discrepancies. A citrate synthase defective mutation (S252C in gltA) further increased the lysine yield in strain DR2 (1.68-fold, 15.7 g/L). Thus, these three mutations coordinately enhanced the lysine yield. Both the malate:quinone oxidoreductase activity and respiration rate were significantly reduced in strains D2 and DR2. Overall, these results provide valuable knowledge for engineering the anaplerotic reaction to increase lysine yield in C. glutamicum.
