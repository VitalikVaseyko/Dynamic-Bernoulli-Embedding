BACKGROUND: In our previous study, it was well defined that IGFBP7 was an important tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to uncover the downstream molecules responsible for IGFBP7's behaviour in this study. METHODS: Differentially expressed protein profiles between PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-transfected RKO cells and the empty vector transfected controls were generated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) identification. The selected differentially expressed protein induced by IGFBP7 was confirmed by western blot and ELISA. The biological behaviour of the protein was explored by cell growth assay and colony formation assay. RESULTS: Six unique proteins were found differentially expressed in PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-transfected RKO cells, including albumin (ALB), 60 kDa heat shock protein(HSP60), Actin cytoplasmic 1 or 2, pyruvate kinase muscle 2(PKM2), beta subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase(FARSB) and hypothetical protein. The downregulation of HSP60 by IGFBP7 was confirmed by western blot and ELISA. Recombinant human HSP60 protein could increase the proliferation rate and the colony formation ability of PcDNA3.1(IGFBP7)-RKO cells. CONCLUSION: HSP60 was an important downstream molecule of IGFBP7. The downregulation of HSP60 induced by IGFBP7 may be, at least in part, responsible for IGFBP7's tumor suppressive biological behaviour in CRC.
