BMP-4 and BMP-7 are associated with the suppression of granulosa cell apoptosis. LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or UCN-01 (PDK-1 inhibitor) increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in the granulosa cells treated with BMP-4 or BMP-7. The inhibitors of ERK and p38 (SB203580) did not increase the percentage of apoptotic cells in the granulosa cells treated with BMP-4 or BMP-7. Akt inhibitor did not induce apoptosis in the BMP-4-treated granulosa cells, whereas it did induce apoptosis of the BMP-7-treated granulosa cells. In the granulosa cells treated with BMP-4, the PKC inhibitor increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Our data show that BMP-4 and BMP-7 are associated with granulosa cell survival via several non-Smad specific pathways: BMP-4 via the PI3K/PDK-1/PKC and BMP-7 via the PI3K/PDK-1/Akt.
