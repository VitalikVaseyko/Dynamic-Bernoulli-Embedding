The effect of intravenous and oral administration of magnesium containing drug (Magnesium Diasporal, Protina, Munchen) on the erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in two cases of congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia associated with PK deficiency has been examined. Intravenous injection of the drug has been followed by transient increase in magnesium content. Positive correlation between erythrocyte magnesium ions concentration and PK activity has been found. The authors propose a hypothesis that the observed correlation may be due to the erythrocyte accumulation of some PK activators or to the elimination of some PK inhibitors. The authors did not, however, succeed to maintain the high erythrocyte magnesium concentration inducing the increase in PK activity during the longer period of time.
