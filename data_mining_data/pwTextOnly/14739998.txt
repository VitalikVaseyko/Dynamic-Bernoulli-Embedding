Cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) from Pichia pastoris yeast cells was found to be activated by either cAMP or cGMP. Analogs of cAMP such as 8-chloro-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP were as potent as cAMP in PKA activation while N6,2'-O-dibutyryl-cAMP did not stimulate the enzyme activity. It was shown that protamine sulfate was almost equally phosphorylated in the presence of 1-2 x 10(-6)M cAMP or cGMP while other substrates such as Kemptide, ribosomal protein S6, were phosphorylated to a lower extent in the presence of cGMP. It was demonstrated that pyruvate kinase is a substrate of PKA which co-purified with the P.pastoris enzyme. Moreover, pyruvate kinase was phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of cAMP and cGMP to comparable levels.
