BACKGROUND/AIMS: Screening for precancerous lesions is important for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal tumors. We investigated M2-pyruvate kinase levels in patients with colorectal polyps and carcinoma and assessed factors affecting M2-pyruvate kinase levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients who had undergone colonoscopic examination and who were diagnosed with a neoplastic lesion were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to the macroscopic diagnosis of polyp or carcinoma. According to histopathological evaluation, specimens were grouped as nonneoplastic lesions, tubular adenoma, tubulovillous adenoma and adenocarcinoma. M2-pyruvate kinase levels were measured with the Tumor M2-pyruvate kinase ELISA kit. RESULTS: Mean M2-pyruvate kinase levels were 76.1+/-57.73 (13.1-288.22) IU/ml. We did not find a correlation between M2-pyruvate kinase levels and age, gender, smoking, alcohol and aspirin consumption and colorectal cancer family history. There was a relationship between body mass index and M2-pyruvate kinase level (p=0.022). The carcinoma group had the highest levels of M2-pyruvate kinase both endoscopically and histopathologically (p=0.009, p=0.019 respectively). M2-pyruvate kinase levels of patients who died were significantly higher than patients who survived (p=0.001). Enzyme values were significantly lower in diabetic patients than nondiabetics (p=0.04); and chronic renal failure patients had higher levels (p=0.045). CONCLUSION: Serum M2-pyruvate kinase levels may be useful in distinguishing malignant and benign lesions of the colon and may provide insight in terms of survival.
