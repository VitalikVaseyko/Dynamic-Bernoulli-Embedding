Misprimed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were generated from the crude leukocytic DNA extract of four of five patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia, during the course of exon 6 pyruvate kinase L gene amplification. These by-products, which originated from abundant mRNA templates, were not observed in seven healthy individuals. Two markers were cloned (GenBank accession numbers M64700 and M64701). We focused further studies on one of the human markers associated with hereditary hemolytic anemia, human DNA marker B (HUMDNAMB). HUMDNAMB is a 451-bp open reading frame that has never been described previously. The nucleic acid sequence region 303-416 is 63% homologous to a coding region of the bovine interferon alpha-A gene. Matrix analysis of the amino acid sequences reveals a structural similarity between the two proteins. The HUMDNAMB protein is expected to be larger than interferons, based on the size of its 2-kb messenger RNA detected by Northern blot in human leukocytes, fetal liver, and fetal intestine.
