Pyruvate kinase activity in Trypanosoma brucei brucei is stimulated in the presence of L-carnitine and is inhibited by acetyl CoA, ATP or the ATP-Mg2+ complex. Increased pyruvate kinase activity is associated with stimulation of ATP synthesis in the presence of L-carnitine. There is evidence that carnitine stimulates pyruvate kinase activity indirectly by removing the inhibitory modulator acetyl CoA as a result of the carnitine acetyl transferase (CAT) also present in the trypanosomes.
