OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of vitamin E (VE ) and magnesium entantion on glucolipid metabolism in obese rats. METHODS: Seventy-four rats were randomly divided into five groups (normal control group positive E group, Mg group, VE plus Mg group). The doses of V(E) and Mg were 0.23 g/kg feed and 0.31 g/kg feed respectively. They were slaughtered after feed for 67 weeks. Calculate the lipid ratio. Examined the level of serum lipid, plasma glucose, serum insulin, insulin sensitivity index, and the activity of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. The results of each group were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA and analysis of variance of factorial design. RESULTS: The rat model with nutritional obesity was successfully established that the weight of positive control group was about 20% higher than normal control group. The lipid ratio and plasma triglyceride of VE plus Mg group were 13. 29% and 0. 6 mmol/L respectively, which were significantly lower than that of positive control group (17.24% and 1. 18 mmol/L) (P < 0.05), and the plasma triglyceride of VE plus Mg group was significantly lower than that of VE group (1. 07mmol/ L) (P <0.05). The activity of hexokinase of V~E group and VE plus Mg group were 63. 67 U/L and 64. 61 U/L respectively, significantly higher than that of positive control group (42.79 U/L) and Mg group (44.02 U/L) (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Supplementation of VE combined with Mg can effectively improve the fat content and triglyceride of obese rats, better than VE alone. Supplementation of VE and Mg is beneficial to obese rats to improve the activity of hexokinase, and adding VE is better than Mg alone.
