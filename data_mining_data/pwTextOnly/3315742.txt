E. coli cells harbouring the recombinant plasmid pDB222 with the 6-HDNO gene under the control of the tac-promotor were induced with IPTG to synthesize a high amount of 6-HDNO protein. Part of this protein was present as 6-HDNO apoenzyme. The proportion of 6-HDNO apoenzyme formed could be increased when the induction of 6-HDNO synthesis by IPTG was performed in the presence of the inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium. The 6-HDNO apoenzyme thus formed could be transformed into enzymatically active holoenzyme in the presence of FAD by a process requiring an energy-generating system consisting of ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. This finding suggests that an enzymatic step(s) is (are) involved in the covalent flavinylation of 6-HDNO.
