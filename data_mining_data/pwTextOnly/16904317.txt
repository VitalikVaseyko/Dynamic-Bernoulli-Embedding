Starting from (+)-epi- and (-)-vibo-quercitols readily produced by bioconversion of myo-inositol, some biologically interesting phosphate and polyphosphate analogues, including the Ins(1,4,5)P(3) derivatives of 3-deoxy- and 6-deoxy-D-myo-inositol, could be readily prepared in a conventional manner. In addition, chemical modification at C-2 of the 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P(3) provided 2-epimer, and 2-deoxy and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro forms. Eight polyphosphate analogues obtained were assayed for biological activity against PDH-Pase and PDH-K, and G6Pase, but none proved positive.
