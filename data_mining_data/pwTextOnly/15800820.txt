BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of colonic neoplasia. Because of the low compliance, the discomfort of bowel preparation and the procedure itself and the (albeit small) risk of perforation or bleeding alternative procedures such as stool tests are being focused on. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After informed consent stool samples of 116 patients (44 male, 72 female, median age 47 years), scheduled for colonoscopy and 22 patients (17 m, 5 f, 69 y) with known colorectal cancer stool samples were collected. The samples were investigated by three methods: a biochemical (Guajak) test for fecal occult blood, an immunological test for fecal occult blood and a test determining the dimer pyruvat kinase M2 (tumor M2-PK). RESULTS: Sensitivity for detection of colorectal cancer or polyps was 27 % and 10 % for the biochemical test, 91 % and 19 % for the immunological test and 77 % and 48 % for the M2-PK-test, respectively. Specificity was 89 %, 94 % and 72 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods for detection of occult blood had a similar specificity. The sensitivity of the immunological test for the detection of colorectal cancer was significantly higher. The M2-PK-test had a markedly lower specificity in diagnosing cancer. Because of the low sensitivity for polyps the usefulness of stool tests is questionable. Reducing incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer should be achieved by colonoscopy, a recommendation that requires specific communication to the public.
