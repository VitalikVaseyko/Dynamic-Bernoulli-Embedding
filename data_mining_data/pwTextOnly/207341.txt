Pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) type L was partly purified from rat kidney. During the last two purification steps, the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into protein on incubation with [32P]ATP and cyclic 3',5'-AMP-dependent protein kinase was found to parallel the pyruvate kinase activity. After phosphorylation of the enzyme, a major radioactive band with a molecular weight of 57 000 was found on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [32P]Phosphorylserine was isolated from the kidney pyruvate kinase. Immunological identity was found between the liver and kidney pyruvate kinases type L. By autoradiography of high-voltage electropherograms after partial acid hydrolysis of the phosphorylated rat liver and kidney pyruvate kinases type L, identical results were obtained. The affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate was found to be decreased by phosphorylation of the enzyme with a change in the apparent Km from 0.15 mM to 0.35 mM. After incubation of the phosphorylated kidney pyruvate kinase with phosphatase the phosphoenolpyruvate saturation curve was found to be identical to that for the unphosphorylated enzyme. Thus, the activity of the rat kidney pyruvate kinase type L is with all probability regulated by a reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction, thereby indicating that hormonal regulation of gluconeogenesis via cyclic AMP may be of importance in the renal cortex.
