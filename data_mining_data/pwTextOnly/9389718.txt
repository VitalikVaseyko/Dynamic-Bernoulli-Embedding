We present a novel G1091 to A mutation in the human liver and red blood cell (RBC) pyruvate kinase (PK) gene causing severe hemolytic anemia. In two families, three children were severely PK-deficient compound heterozygotes exhibiting the G1091 to A mutation and a common G1529 to A mutation on the other allele. In one family, the mother, a G1091 to A heterozygote, later had a second baby with a new husband, also a G1091 to A carrier. The baby was homozygous for the G1091 to A mutation and died 6 weeks after birth from severe hemolysis. Both mutant alleles were expressed at the RNA level. The G1091 to A mutation results in the substitution of a conserved glycine by an aspartate in domain A of RBC PK, whereas the G1529 to A mutation leads to the substitution of a conserved arginine residue with glutamine in the C-domain. Molecular modelling of human RBC PK, based on the crystal structure of cat muscle PK, shows that both mutations are located outside the catalytic site at the interface of domains A and C. The mutations are likely to disrupt the critical conformation of the interface by introducing alternative salt bridges. In this way the Gly364 to Asp and Arg510 to Gln substitutions may cause PK deficiency by influencing the allosteric properties of the enzyme.
