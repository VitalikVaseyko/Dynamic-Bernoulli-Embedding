The effects of cell age on metabolism in the nucleated red blood cells of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were examined. Red blood cells were separated according to age using fixed-angle centrifugation. The mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration in old red blood cells was found to be 120 % of that in young red blood cells. In young red blood cells, the activities of the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase and cytochrome oxidase were 135-200 %, respectively, of those measured in old red blood cells. The activity of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase in young red blood cells was 170 % of that in old red blood cells, whereas the activity of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase was not significantly affected by cell age. In addition, young red blood cells consumed over twice as much O(2) and devoted 50 % more O(2) to protein synthesis and the activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase than old red blood cells. Red blood cell age did not significantly affect the rate of lactate production. This study shows that ageing in rainbow trout nucleated red blood cells is accompanied by a significant decline in aerobic energy production and the processes it supports, as well as a corresponding increase in the glycolytic contribution to metabolism.
