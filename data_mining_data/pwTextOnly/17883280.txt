The present study examines pyruvate kinase-conjugated antibodies for potential use in ELISA applications. The conjugates had an acceptable stability, and the coupling inflicted only minor impairment on the kinase activity. To mimic the setup of an immunoassay under development, a test antigen (BSA) was attached to polystyrene nanoparticles. This arrangement was found to be suitable as solid support for presentation of antigens in sensitive bioluminescence assays. The nanoparticles were well characterized in terms of protein surface load and were used to establish the number of conjugate complexes needed to generate a detectable signal. Under the biochemical conditions employed here, the detection limit of the pyruvate kinase conjugate lies in the femtomole range.
