L-type pyruvate kinase gene expression is modulated by hormonal and nutritional conditions. Here, we show by transient transfections in hepatocytes in primary culture that both the glucose response element and the contiguous hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) binding site (L3) of the promoter were negative cyclic AMP (cAMP) response elements and that cAMP-dependent inhibition through L3 requires HNF4 binding. Another HNF4 binding site-dependent construct was also inhibited by cAMP. However, HNF4 mutants whose putative PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites have been mutated still conferred cAMP-sensitive transactivation of a L3-dependent reporter gene. Overexpression of the CREB binding protein (CBP) increased the HNF4-dependent transactivation but this effect remained sensitive to cAMP inhibition.
