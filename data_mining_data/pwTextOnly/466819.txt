A four enzyme system catalyzing a sequence of reactions was immobilized onto the inside surfaces of nylon tubes and studied as a possible method of analysis for the first substrate, creatinine in the sequence of reactions. The system was first studied in solution as a guide to optimizing conditions for preparation and use of the immobilized enzyme nylon tube reactors. The scope and limitations of this approach to routine analysis is discussed.
