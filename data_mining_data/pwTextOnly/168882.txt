1. The mechanism by which insulin activates pyruvate dehydrogenase in rat epididymal adipose tissue was further investigated. 2. When crude extracts, prepared from tissue segments previously exposed to insulin (2m-i.u/ml) for 2min, were supplemented with Mg-2+, Ca-2+, glucose and hexokinase and incubated at 30 degrees C, they displayed an enhanced rate of increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity compared with control extracts. 3. When similar extracts were instead supplemented with fluoride, ADP, creatine phosphate and creatine kinase, the rate of decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed during incubation at 30 degrees C was unaffected by insulin treatment. 4. It is suggested that insulin increases the fraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase present in the tissue in the active dephospho form by increasing the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase.
