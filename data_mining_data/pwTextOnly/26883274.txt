The current standard of care for glioblastoma (GBM) is surgical resection, radiotherapy, and treatment with temozolomide (TMZ). However, resistance to current therapies and recurrence are common. To improve survival, agents that target the PI3K signaling pathway, which is activated in approximately 88% of GBM, are currently in clinical trials. A challenge with such therapies is that tumor shrinkage is not always observed. New imaging methods are therefore needed to monitor response to therapy and predict survival. The goal of this study was to determine whether hyperpolarized (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can be used to monitor response to the second-generation dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor voxtalisib (XL765, SAR245409), alone or in combination with TMZ. We investigated GS-2 and U87-MG GBM orthotopic tumors in mice, and used MRI, hyperpolarized (13)C MRSI, and (1)H MRS to monitor the effects of treatment. In our study, (1)H MRS could not predict tumor response to therapy. However, in both our models, we observed a significantly lower hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in animals treated with voxtalisib, TMZ, or combination therapy, when compared with controls. This metabolic alteration was observed prior to MRI-detectable changes in tumor size, was consistent with drug action, and was associated with enhanced animal survival. Our findings confirm the potential translational value of the hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio as a biomarker for noninvasively assessing the effects of emerging therapies for patients with GBM.
