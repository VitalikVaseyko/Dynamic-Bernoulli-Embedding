Fungal dimorphism is important for survival in different environments and has been related to virulence. The ascomycete Yarrowia lipolytica can grow as yeast, pseudomycelial or mycelial forms. We have used a Y. lipolytica parental strain and a Deltahoy1 mutant, which is unable to form hypha, to set up a model for dimorphism and to characterize in more depth the yeast to hypha transition by proteomic techniques. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) based differential expression analysis of Y. lipolytica yeast and hyphal cells was performed, and 45 differentially expressed proteins were detected; nine with decreased expression in hyphal cells were identified. They corresponded to the S. cerevisiae homologues of Imd4p, Pdx3p, Cdc19, Sse1p, Sol3p, Sod2p, Xpt1p, Mdh1p and to the unknown protein YALIOB00924g. Remarkably, most of these proteins are involved in metabolic pathways, with four showing oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, taking into account that this is the first report of 2-DE analysis of Y. lipolytica protein extracts, 35 more proteins from the 2D map of soluble yeast proteins, which were involved in metabolism, cell rescue, energy and protein synthesis, were identified.
