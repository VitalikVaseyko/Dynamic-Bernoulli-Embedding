Open reading frames longer than 300 bases were observed in the antisense strands of the genes coding for the glycolytic enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase and alcohol dehydrogenase I. The open reading frames on both strands are in codon register. It has been suggested that proteins coded in codon register by complementary DNA strands can bind to each other. Consequently, it was interesting to investigate whether the open reading frames in the antisense strands of glycolytic enzyme genes are functional. We used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the PGI1 phosphoglucose isomerase gene to introduce pairs of closely spaced base substitutions that resulted in stop codons in one strand and only silent replacements in the other. Introduction of the two stop codons into the PGI1 sense strand caused the same physiological defects as already observed for pgil deletion mutants. No detectable effects were caused by the two stop codons in the antisense strand. A deletion that removed a section from -31 bp to +109 bp of the PGI1 gene but left 83 bases of the 3' region beyond the antisense open reading frame had the same phenotype as a deletion removing both reading frames. A similar pair of deletions of the PYK1 gene and its antisense reading frame showed identical defects. Our own Northern experiments and those reported by other authors using double-stranded probes detected only one transcript for each gene. These observations indicate that the antisense reading frames are not functional. On the other hand, evidence is provided to show that the rather long reading frames in the antisense strands of these glycolytic enzyme genes could arise from the strongly selective codon usage in highly expressed yeast genes, which reduces the frequency of stop codons in the antisense strand.
