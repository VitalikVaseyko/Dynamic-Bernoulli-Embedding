AIMS: Inflammatory responses in the heart that are driven by sustained increases in cytokines have been associated with several pathological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Emerging data suggest a link between cardiomyopathy and myocardial metabolism dysregulation. To further elucidate the relationship between a pro-inflammatory profile and cardiac metabolism dysregulation, a human cell line of cardiac origin, AC16, was treated with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). METHODS AND RESULTS: Exposure of AC16 cells to TNF-alpha inhibited the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), an upstream regulator of lipid and glucose oxidative metabolism. Studies performed with cardiac-specific transgenic mice (Mus musculus) overexpressing TNF-alpha, which have been well characterized as a model of cytokine-induced cardiomyopathy, also displayed reduced PGC-1alpha expression in the heart compared with that of control mice. The mechanism by which TNF-alpha reduced PGC-1alpha expression in vitro appeared to be largely mediated via both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. PGC-1alpha downregulation resulted in an increase in glucose oxidation rate, which involved a reduction in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 expression and depended on the DNA-binding activity of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta and estrogen-related receptor alpha transcription factors. CONCLUSION: These results point to PGC-1alpha downregulation as a potential contributor to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in metabolic disorders with an inflammatory background.
