The main intention of this study was the investigation of impact of natural biologically active ligands of nuclear retinoid/retinoid X receptors (all-trans and 9-cis retinoic acid) on proteomic pattern in human estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. For this purpose, proteomic strategies based on bottom-up method were applied. The total cell proteins were extracted utilizing a commercially Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer and separated on 2D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE). The proteins were subsequently digested in-gel by trypsin and their characterization was achieved by MALDI-TOF/TOF. By employing PDQuest software, we identified more than 50 proteins affected by retinoic acid isomers. For more information, 9 proteins which are associated with tumor process were selected. We determined that derivatives of retinoic acid led to significantly reduced level of proteins belonging to metabolic pathway (e.g. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or pyruvate kinase 2) or to other cellular processes as apoptosis, regulation of transcription process or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (e.g. annexins, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, vimentin). On the other hand all-trans retinoic acid treatment indicates up-regulated effect for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1.
