Genetic polymorphism exists in erythrocytic pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient hemolytic anemia, as briefly described. Destruction of erythrocytes varied in extent, but its mechanisms in different PK-deficient polymorphic persons investigated were similar. A paradoxical post-splenectomy reticulocytosis regularly occurred. Qualitative enzymatic differences, the biochemistry, and measurements of erythrocytic destruction were made in several PK variants. 51Cr autologous and cross-transfusions of PK-deficient erythrocytes into volunteers showed multimodel regression lines of several erythrocytic cohorts. 59Felabeled PK-deficient reticulocytes donated by PK-deficient splenectomized subjects were transfused 20 hours before splenectomy into two PK-deficient infants with hemolysis, and into two adult volunteers with autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The highest reticulocyte concentration in any organ initially was within the spleen. Radioiron-labeled erythrocytes and cytologic data showed large splenic reticulocyte pools. Splenic macrophages ingesting reticulocytes and erythrocytes were seen by both light and electron microscopy of the splenic pulp. After cyanide additives inhibiting reticulocyte oxidative phosphorylation, a bizarre erythrocytic cytologic configuration was found by scanning electron microscopy. These studies of PK-mutant subjects with PK-deficient erythrocytic hemolysis showed age dependent destruction of erythrocytes. Bimodal Cr survival data suggested reticuloendothelial removal of short-lived erythrocytes and reticulocytes. The transfusions of radioironlabeled PK reticulocytes and the data obtained by scanning electron microscopy suggested that the spleen was the initial hostile organ destroying a cohort of susceptible erythrocytes, prinicpally reticulocytes.
