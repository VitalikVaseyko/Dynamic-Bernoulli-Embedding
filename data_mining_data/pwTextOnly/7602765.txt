Recent progress in biotechnology is tremendous and its application to isozyme diagnosis has been altered. First, the mechanism of isozyme system in molecular level has been revealed and clinical assessment of isozymes has been followed. Several examples are shown: tumor-producing amylase is caused by translocation of amylase gene; serum cholinesterase is encoded by only one gene; pyruvate kinase gene has two independent exon, containing translation initiator signal; electrophoretic variant of lactate dehydrogenase is caused by missense mutation; alkaline phosphatase isozymes are constituted from different allele products and post-translational modification. Second, improvement of assay procedure by using biotechnology have made isozyme analysis easier, faster, more convenient and more precise. Stable enzymes and monoclonal antibodies against the produced enzymes have been utilized for a different recognition of isozymes. It is believed that a diagnostic system of isozymes will be established in detail.
