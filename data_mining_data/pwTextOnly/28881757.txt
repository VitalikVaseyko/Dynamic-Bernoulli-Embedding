The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of cadmium-induced apoptosis in chicken spleens and the antagonistic effects of selenium. We duplicated the selenium-cadmium interaction model and examined the expression of apoptosis-, immune-, mitochondrial dynamics- and energy metabolism-related genes. The results demonstrated that after treatment with cadmium, the frequency of apoptosis was significantly increased, and the morphological characteristics of apoptosis were observed. The expression of pro-apoptotic genes was increased, and that of anti-apoptotic genes was decreased. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interlenkin-1beta were observably increased, but the interlenkin-2 and interferon-gamma levels were markedly decreased. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of dynamin-related protein 1 and mitochondrial fission factor were significantly enhanced, whereas mitofusin 1, mitofusin 2, and optic atrophy 1 were markedly decreased. The expression of hexokinase 1, hexokinase 2, aconitase 2, lactate dehydrogenase A, lactate dehydrogenase B, succinatedehydrogenase B, pyruvate kinase and phosphofructokinase were also reduced. Selenium supplements remarkably attenuated cadmium-induced effects (p < 0.05). Based on the above results, conclude that the cadmium treatment promoted a mitochondrial dynamic imbalance and reduced energy metabolism, leading to apoptosis and immune dysfunction in chicken spleens, and selenium had an antagonistic effect on Cd-induced apoptosis.
