In extracts of adult Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the activities of enzymes including glucokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triosepho sphate isomerase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerokinase, phosphoglyceromutase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were demonstrated. The present of significant activity of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase may indicate the possibility of an operative of alpha-glycerophosphate and pentose phosphate pathway.
