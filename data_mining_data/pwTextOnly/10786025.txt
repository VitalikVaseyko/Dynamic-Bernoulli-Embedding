SDS-PAGE was used to separate tissue proteins of control and trematode-infected Biomphalaria alexandrina snails. The separated profiles demonstrate the occasional appearance of protein fractions and the remarkable increase of concentration of certain molecular masses in infected snails at one week interval over four weeks post exposure to Schistosoma mansoni. Proteins of molecular masses of 44, 56, 65 and 144 KDa were among these occasionally appeared protein masses. Post exposure to S. mansoni larval infection, a protein mass of 36 KDa was predominant giving a markedely higher absorbance (> 1) compared to control (0.0166). This was identified as lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Moreover, a protein of 56 KDa mass was identified as Pyruvate kinase. The predicted induction of these two enzymes could be either of host and/or parasitic origin. This study revealed that S. mansoni- B. alexandrina complex has a completely different protein pattern compared to control with very low similarity coefficient "S" value. A correlation between the snail tissue protein or separation patterns and the metabolic redirection of the snail host by the developing sporocyst was discussed.
