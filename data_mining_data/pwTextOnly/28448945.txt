This review of the basics of cancer metabolism focuses on exploiting the metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells. The first part of the review covers the different metabolic pathways utilized in normal cells to generate cellular energy, or ATP, and the glycolytic intermediates required to build the cellular machinery. The second part of the review discusses aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, and the metabolic reprogramming involving glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glutaminolysis in the context of developing targeted inhibitors in cancer cells. Finally, the selective targeting of cancer mitochondrial metabolism using positively charged lipophilic compounds as potential therapeutics and their ability to mitigate the toxic side effects of conventional chemotherapeutics in normal cells are discussed. I hope this graphical review will be useful in helping undergraduate, graduate, and medical students understand how investigating the basics of cancer cell metabolism could provide new insight in developing potentially new anticancer treatment strategies.
