Previous studies have shown that the concentration of red blood cell (RBC) magnesium is significantly lower in subjects carrying an HLA-BW 35 antigen (p less than 0.001) than in non-carriers. As this finding might be related to modifications of the RBC membrane sialoglycoconjugates, RBC sialic acid was comparatively determined in BW 35+ and BW 35- subjects. Pyruvate-kinase activity mean RBC volume, and reticulocyte count have also been determined in order to estimate whether some significant variations in the level of these age markers could be detected between the HLA BW 35+ and BW 35- subjects. A significant negative correlation between sialic acid and RBC magnesium concentrations was observed for the whole population tested (n 57, p less than 0.005), 61% of the BW 35+ and only 25% of the BW 35- individuals having sialic acid values above, and magnesium values below the overall mean (p less than 0.01). The variance of mean RBC volume was also larger for the BW 35+ group. Other determinations did not show any significant variations, suggesting that the results are not related to RBC age.
