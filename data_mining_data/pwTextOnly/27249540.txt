Identification of cellular proteins, in addition to already known transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, Sp1, C-EBPbeta, NFAT, ATF/CREB, and LEF-1, which interact with the HIV-1 LTR, is critical in understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages. Our studies demonstrate upregulation of pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) expression during HIV-1SF162 infection of monocyte/macrophages and reactivation of HIV-1 in U1 cells, a macrophage model of latency. We observed that HIV-1SF162 infection of monocyte/macrophages and reactivation of HIV-1 in U1 cells by PMA resulted in increased levels of nuclear PKM2 compared to PMA-induced U937 cells. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the nuclear dimeric form of PKM2 in the PMA-induced U1 cells in comparison to PMA-induced U937 cells. We focused on understanding the potential role of PKM2 in HIV-1 LTR transactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in PMA-activated U1 and TZM-bl cells demonstrated the interaction of PKM2 with the HIV-1 LTR. Our studies show that overexpression of PKM2 results in transactivation of HIV-1 LTR-luciferase reporter in U937, U-87 MG, and TZM-bl cells. Using various truncated constructs of the HIV-1 LTR, we mapped the region spanning -120 bp to -80 bp to be essential for PKM2-mediated transactivation. This region contains the NF-kappaB binding site and deletion of this site attenuated PKM2-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR. Immunoprecipitation experiments using U1 cell lysates demonstrated a physical interaction between PKM2 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. These observations demonstrate for the first time that PKM2 is a transcriptional co-activator of HIV-1 LTR. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 517-525, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
