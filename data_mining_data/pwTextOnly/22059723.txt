Twenty-four pigs were assigned to one of four ad libitum water treatments: control, sodium bicarbonate (12.6 g/litre), low ammonium chloride (4 g/litre) or high ammonium chloride (8 g/litre) for 5 days, to study the influence of an oral acid or base load on post-mortem changes in longissimus dorsi muscle and ultimate pork quality. Physiological changes before slaughter were monitored by measuring blood pH, pCO(2) and HCO(3)(-). The influence of dietary treatments on post-mortem changes and ultimate meat quality was determined by measuring glycolytic enzymes and intermediates, and muscle pH, color and water-holding capacity (WHC). As expected, sodium bicarbonate generated a metabolic alkalosis, whereas ammonium chloride resulted in a metabolic acidosis. Pre-slaughter acid-base status was positively correlated with muscle WHC (P < 0.05). However, no significant dietary treatment effect was observed in muscle quality traits such as color (a, b, L) and WHC. Muscle pH(45) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in bicarbonate than control and high ammonium chloride treatments. The activity of Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase was significantly (P < 0.05) higher at 45 min post-mortem but that of pyruvate kinase was significantly lower at 2 and 4 h post mortem in bicarbonate-treated pigs. At 45 min post mortem, the activity of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase in the control pigs was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than on other treatments. The concentration of glycogen was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in bicarbonate and high ammonium chloride pigs; bicarbonate-treated pigs also has significantly higher adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) and pH values than other treatment groups (P < 0.05) at early post-mortem. It was concluded that pre-slaughter oral loading of acid or base could induce changes in muscle metabolism and post-mortem muscle pH. Further research is required to confirm that altering diet acidogenicity or alkalinogenicity may be a means of enhancing ultimate pork quality.
