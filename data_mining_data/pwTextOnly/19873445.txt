1. By means of the Warburg-Barcroft microrespirometer apparatus and the Warburg direct method, the relative effect of caffeine upon the O(2) consumption of the fertilized egg of Arbacia punctulata was shown for the following concentrations in sea water: 0.002 per cent (M/10,000), 0.004 per cent (M/5,000), 0.02 per cent (M/1,000), 0.1 per cent (M/200), 0.2 per cent (M/100), 0.5 per cent (M/40), and 2 per cent (M/10). 2. In comparison with the normal eggs (uninhibited, non-caffeine-treated controls), caffeine in concentrations including and greater than 0.1 per cent (M/200) depressed the average uptake from approximately 25 to 61 per cent over the 3 hour period. In a number of instances, as typified by Experiment 10, the effective inhibitory concentration ranged from 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) upward and the degree of depression of the O(2) consumption ranged from 10.6 per cent to 60.6 per cent. 3. All caffeine concentrations including and above 0.02 per cent (M/1,000) in the series used, resulted in decreasing the normal rate of cleavage division in the fertilized Arbacia eggs. 4. The higher concentrations (0.5 and 2 per cent) produced a complete blockage of the cleavage process. 5. Complete cleavage inhibition was noted only when the O(2) uptake had been depressed to 50 per cent or more of the normal controls. 6. O(2) consumption-time relationship data indicate an average depression, in O(2) consumption over a 3 hour period, ranging from 25 per cent with a caffeine concentration of 0.1 per cent to a 61 per cent inhibition with a concentration of 2 per cent. 7. Concentrations of less than 0.1 per cent (certainly of less than 0.02 per cent) give variable results and indicate no significant effect. 8. It is inferred from the respiration data presented that it is probable that the inhibition of the O(2) consumption in fertilized Arbacia eggs is due to the influence of caffeine upon the main (activity or primary) pathway. It will be observed that there are certain similarities of the caffeine data to the degree of inhibition accomplished by sodium cyanide. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the cyanide probably acts on the cytochrome oxidase step in the cytochrome oxidase-cytochrome chain of reactions constituting the O(2) uptake phase of respiratory metabolism. It is not improbable, therefore, that caffeine also may act upon the cytochrome oxidase enzyme. 9. From the viewpoint of environmental conditions influencing reproductive phenomena, it is of interest that caffeine can affect the normal metabolism of the zygote.
