When stress-susceptible and stress-resistant pigs consumed diets containing 10 iu vitamin E kg-1, the stress-susceptible pigs had damaged cell membranes. This was indicated by increased plasma activities of creatine kinase and pyruvate kinase. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and conjugated dienes were also increased suggesting that the membrane damage was caused by free radicals. Susceptibility to free radicals was further demonstrated by an increased tendency for erythrocytes and tissue homogenates from stress-susceptible pigs to peroxidise when incubated with hydrogen peroxide and iron, respectively. Supplementation of the diets with approximately 20 times normal requirements of vitamin E decreased plasma creatine kinase and pyruvate kinase activities, and inhibited the formation of the indices of peroxidation in vivo and in vitro. It is concluded that the stress-susceptible pig has an abnormality in its antioxidant defence mechanisms. However, this abnormality was not due to a deficiency in selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, since activities were significantly increased in the longissimus dorsi of stress-susceptible pigs. Although the nature of the antioxidant defect is unclear, it is suggested that stress-susceptible pigs are under a sustained oxidant stress and that a decreased ability to accommodate even a normal free radical load may contribute to the rapid development of the fatal stress response.
