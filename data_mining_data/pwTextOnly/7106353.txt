1. Two experiments were performed to examine the effects of duodenal glucose infusion on hepatic enzyme activities in sheep. 2. Glucose infusion significantly increased the specific activities of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and significantly reduced the specific activity of glucose-6-phosphatase suggesting that the pathways of glucose breakdown are increased, and gluconeogenesis decreased, in glucose-infused animals. 3. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of diet on liver metabolism in sheep.
