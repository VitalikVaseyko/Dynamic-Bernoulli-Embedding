The ability of injected Photofrin II, a preparation enriched in hydrophobic dihaematoporphyrin ethers and esters, to photosensitize selected mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes during illumination in vitro was examined. Preparations of R3230AC mammary tumours, obtained at designated times after a single dose of Photofrin II, displayed a time-dependent photosensitivity. Maximum inhibition of mitochondrial enzymes occurred at 24 hours post-treatment, whereas no inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase, was observed over the 168 hour time course. At the selected 24 hour time point, mitochondrial enzyme photosensitisation was found to be drug dose (5.25 mg kg-1 Photofrin II) and light dose dependent, the rank order of inhibition being cytochrome c oxidase greater than F0F1 ATPase greater than succinate dehydrogenase greater than NADH dehydrogenase. We conclude that porphyrin species contained in Photofrin II accumulate in mitochondria of tumour cells in vivo and produce maximum photosensitisation at 24-72 hours after administration to tumour-bearing animals. The time course observed here with Photofrin II is similar to that seen previously with the more heterogenous haematoporphyrin derivative preparation in this in vivo-in vitro model.
