Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor and plays important roles in breast cancer cell proliferation. The complexity of the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer and the involvement of PPARgamma in breast cancer pathophysiology are unclear. In this study, we carried out prediction of the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) motifs in 2332 genes reported to be involved in breast cancer in literature. A total of 178 genes were found to have PPRE (DR1/DR2) and/or PPAR-associated conserved motif (PACM) motifs. We further constructed protein-protein interaction network, disease gene network and gene ontology (GO) analyses to identify novel key genes for experimental validation. We identified two genes in the glycolytic pathway (phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)) at the ATP production steps and experimentally validated their repression by PPARgamma in two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Further analysis suggested that this repression leads to decrease in ATP levels and apoptosis. These investigations will help us in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which PPARgamma regulates the cellular energy pathway and the use of its ligands in human breast cancer therapeutics.
