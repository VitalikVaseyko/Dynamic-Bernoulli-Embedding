Mapping the insertion points of 16 signature-tagged transposon mutants on the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome led to the identification of a 40-kb virulence gene cluster at minute 30.7. This locus is conserved among all other Salmonella species examined but is not present in a variety of other pathogenic bacteria or in Escherichia coli K-12. Nucleotide sequencing of a portion of this locus revealed 11 open reading frames whose predicted proteins encode components of a type III secretion system. To distinguish between this and the type III secretion system encoded by the inv/spa invasion locus known to reside on a pathogenicity island, we refer to the inv/spa locus as Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) 1 and the new locus as SPI2. SPI2 has a lower G+C content than that of the remainder of the Salmonella genome and is flanked by genes whose products share greater than 90% identity with those of the E. coli ydhE and pykF genes. Thus SPI2 was probably acquired horizontally by insertion into a region corresponding to that between the ydhE and pykF genes of E. coli. Virulence studies of SPI2 mutants have shown them to be attenuated by at least five orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type strain after oral or intraperitoneal inoculation of mice.
