Cytosolic pyruvate kinase fractions A and B obtained by salting out procedure from normal rat liver and Morris hepatoma 7777, purified by affinity chromatography on Blue Sepharose CL-6B, have shown similar electrophoretic patterns in polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.3 to previously studied pyruvate kinase extracts from chromatin of cell nuclei. Three variants (alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 1) from normal rat liver pyruvate kinase fraction A (type L) had the greatest electrophoretic mobility, showed sigmoidal kinetics in relation to 2-phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and sensitivity to ATP and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP). The fraction A dominated over normal liver fraction B (type M2), which in electrophoresis showed a slower gamma 2 variant, similar to the fraction A of hepatoma. All variants from fractions B of normal liver and A of hepatoma had linear kinetics and were sensitive to ATP but not to FDP. The greatest differences showed pyruvate kinase fraction B from Morris hepatoma. Its all variants alpha 2, beta 2, gamma 3 were cathodic and had linear kinetics in relation to PEP. They all were insensitive to normal signal molecules (ATP and FDP). The gamma 3 alkaline variant acquired sensitivity to inhibition by L-cysteine. Showing several-fold higher activity, much greater affinity to the main substrate, and a lack of sensitivity to feed-back inhibition by ATP, it was responsible for a high rate of aerobic glycolysis and diminution of the Pasteur effect in metabolic studies. It was probably encoded during oncogene activation and plays a special role in different metabolic strategies of tumour cells.
