AKR and HSS lymphoid leukemias were transplanted into identical mouse strains and changes in pyruvate kinase activity were measured in thymus, mesenteric lymph node and spleen during the posttransplantation period. The heterogeneity of the cellular density and the size distribution were determined in the HSS spleen cells in order to get more information about the settlement and proliferation of the transplanted leukemic lymphoblasts. The data obtained suggest that this model system may be useful for a follow up the fate of leukemic blast cells in the host animal.
