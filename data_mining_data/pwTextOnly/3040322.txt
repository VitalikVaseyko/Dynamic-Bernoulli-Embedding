Therapy with enzyme inducing drugs may improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We evaluated the role of a mixed function oxidase system on glucose metabolism with an animal model. Rats were treated with an inducer (phenobarbital), an inhibitor (cimetidine) and a hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) for a week to cause alterations in the liver. The mixed function oxidase system was assayed by determination of the cytochrome P-450 content and NADPH cytochrome c reductase in liver. Carbohydrate metabolism was evaluated by determining blood glucose, enzymes associated with glucose phosphorylation in the liver (glucokinase, hexokinase), glucose storage as glycogen and enzymatic delivery, glucose-6-phosphatase, and peripheral tissue by determining phosphorylating enzyme (hexokinase) and a key glycolytic enzyme (pyruvate kinase) and glycogen content in muscles. The therapy with the inducer enhanced glucose utilization in liver and storage in muscles. The inhibitor decreased the mixed function oxidase system, reduced glucose phosphorylating, but not gluconeogenetic enzymes, in the liver and increased glycolysis in muscles. Carbon tetrachloride, a hepatotoxin, impaired mixed function oxidase, glucose phosphorylating and delivering enzyme activity in liver, reduced blood glucose and caused glycogen accumulation in muscles. The function of liver microsomal enzyme system seems to be closely related to enzymatic glucose metabolism in the liver and muscles.
