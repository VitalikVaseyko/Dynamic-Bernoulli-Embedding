B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common hematological malignancy diagnosed in children, and blockade of the abnormally activated PI3Kdelta displayed promising outcomes in B cell acute or chronic leukemias, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report a novel PI3Kdelta selective inhibitor X-370, which displays distinct binding mode with p110delta and blocks constitutively active or stimulus-induced PI3Kdelta signaling. X-370 significantly inhibited survival of human B cell leukemia cells in vitro, with associated induction of G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. X-370 abrogated both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling via blockade of PDK1 binding to and/or phosphorylation of MEK1/2. Forced expression of a constitutively active MEK1 attenuated the antiproliferative activity of X-370. X-370 preferentially inhibited the survival of primary pediatric B-ALL cells displaying PI3Kdelta-dependent Erk1/2 phosphorylation, while combined inhibition of PI3Kdelta and MEK1/2 displayed enhanced activity. We conclude that PI3Kdelta inhibition led to abrogation of both Akt and Erk1/2 signaling via a novel PI3K-PDK1/MEK1/2-Erk1/2 signaling cascade, which contributed to its efficacy against B-ALL. These findings support the rationale for clinical testing of PI3Kdelta inhibitors in pediatric B-ALL and provide insights needed to optimize the therapeutic strategy.
