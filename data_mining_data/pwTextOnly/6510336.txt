The levels of L-lactate and pyruvate as well as the enzymes of their conversion (lactate dehydrogenase in direct and reverse reactions, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, alanine transaminase) have been studied simultaneously in the liver and skeletal muscle of rats bearing carcinosarcoma Walker 256, control animals and after additional oxythiamine administration. Properties of oxythiamine independent of its anticoenzymic activity manifest themselves in the body of tumour-bearing animals to a greater extent. After the antivitamin administration there occur strong inhibition of pyruvate kinase, activation of alanine transaminase, normalization of the L-lactate level in the tissues.
