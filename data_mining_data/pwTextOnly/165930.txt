The activities of ATP-consuming and ATP-producing steps of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, as well as other glycolytic enzymes (phosphoglucomutase and enolase) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase are lower in leucocytes from cord blood than in white cells from adults. These results are related to previous observations (reduced anaerobic glycolysis and nitroblue tetrazolium-test in leucocytes from newborn infants) and discussed in connection with the fact that newborn infants are more susceptible to infections than normal adults.
