OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of tumor M2 pyruvate kinase (tumor M2-PK) in the diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer. METHODS: The diagnosis clinical studies of tumor M2-PK in the diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer were electronic researched in the Medline, EMBASE, WANFANG, and CNIK databases. The data of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative were extracted from each of the individual studies. We use Stata11.0 (http://www.stata.com; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) and MetaDiSc 1.4 software to pool the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). RESULTS: Eleven diagnostic clinical studies with 1294 subjects were included in this diagnostic meta-analysis. The combined sensitivity, specificity, positive likely hood ratio, negative likely hood ratio were 0.69 (0.65-0.72), 0.92 (0.89-0.94), 7.84 (5.92-10.38), 0.36 (0.32-0.40). And the area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (0.90-0.94). CONCLUSION: Serum tumor M2-PK can be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer.
