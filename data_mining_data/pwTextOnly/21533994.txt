Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are evolutionarily conserved enzymes involved in many biological processes such as metastasis, proliferation, development, differentiation, ciliary functions, vesicle transport and apoptosis in vertebrates. Biochemical mechanisms of these processes are still largely unknown. Sponges (Porifera) are simple metazoans without tissues, closest to the common ancestor of all animals. They changed little during evolution and probably provide the best insight into the metazoan ancestors' genomic features. The purpose of this study was to address structural and functional properties of group II Nme6 gene/protein ortholog from the marine sponge Suberites domuncula, Nme6, in order to elucidate its evolutionary history. Sponge Nme6 gene and promoter were sequenced and analysed with various bioinformatical tools. Nme6 and Nme6Delta31 proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21 and NDPK activity was measured using a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay. Subcellular localization in human tumour cells was examined by confocal scanning microscopy. Our results show that the sponge Nme6 compared to human Nme6 does not possess NDPK activity, does not localize in mitochondria at least in human cells although it has a putative mitochondrial signal sequence, lacks two recent introns that comprise miRNAs and have different transcriptional binding sites in the promoter region. Therefore, we conclude that the structure of Nme6 gene has changed during metazoan evolution possibly in correlation with the function of the protein.
