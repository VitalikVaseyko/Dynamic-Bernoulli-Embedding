Liver cell sap from normally fed rats, rats fed with a high-carbohydrate diet and fasted rats was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose (pH 7.0). The chromatogram from each diet group was analyzed for pyruvate kinase activity and endogenous substrates of cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase. The materials were pooled into five phosphorylatable fractions, in each of which phosphate incorporation at 0.1 mM and 1.0 mM [32P]ATP in the presence of cyclic AMP and protein kinase was determined. For characterization of the phosphorylatable components, thin-layer gel chromatography on Sephadex G-200 and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in detergent were used for determination of native and minimal molecular weights, respectively. Except for pyruvate kinase, eight components which incorporated at least 0.05 nmol of [32P]phosphate/g of liver were detected. The phosphorylation of four of them was stimulated by cyclic AMP. Their minimal molecular weights were 42000, 21000, 52000 and 49000. The component with a minimal molecular weight of 42000 seemed to have a native molecular weight of 160000. Both the 21000 and the 52000 component had a native molecular weight of about 110000-120000. The protein with a minimal molecular weight of 49000 could not be correlated with certainty to a native molecular weight. The proteins whose phosphorylation was not stimulated by cyclic AMP had minimal molecular weights of 54000, 39000, 34000 and 22000.
