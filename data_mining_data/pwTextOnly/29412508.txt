Many health effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus are desirable among these the adhesion ability is vital to enhance the possibility of colonization and stabilisation associated with the gut mucosal barrier. In this study, the growth characteristics and the adhesion activity of L. acidophilus in the intestine-like pH environment (pH 7.5) were identified. The number of bacteria adhering to the HT-29 cells was found with a gradual increase trend (pH 5.5-7.5). This also led to the morphological changes of L. acidophilus after exposure to different pH environments. Furthermore, with the help of the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteomic analysis, 207 proteins were detected differentially expressed at pH of 7.5. The use of GO analysis and KEGG analysis indicated three essential pathways related to the cell envelope peptide-glycan biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were obviously changed. Adhesion related surface protein fmtB and PrtP were up-regulated in pH 7.5 group. While the moonlight proteins like pyruvate kinase, which binds specifically to the mucin layer and inhibits the adhesive activity of L. acidophilus was found down-regulated. These results could be useful to understand the adhesion mechanism of L. acidophilus adapting for the gut mucosal barrier in the intestinal environment. This article is protected by copyright.
