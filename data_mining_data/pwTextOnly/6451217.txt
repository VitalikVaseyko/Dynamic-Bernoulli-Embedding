The short preincubation of submitochondrial particles with low concentrations of ADP in the presence of Mg2+ results in a complete loss of their ATPase and inosine triphosphatase activities. Other nucleoside diphosphates (IDP and GDP) do not affect the ATPase activity. The ADP-inhibited ATPase can be activated in a time-dependent manner by treatment of submitochondrial particles with the enzyme converting ADP into ATP (phosphoenolpyruvate plus pyruvate kinase). The activaton is a first-order reaction with rate constant 0.2 min-1 at 25 degrees C. The rate constant of activation is increased in the presence of ATP up to 2 min-1, and this increase shows saturation kinetics with Km value equal to that for ATPase reaction itself (10(-4) M at 25 degrees C at pH 8.0). The experimental results obtained are consistent with the model where two alternative pathways of ADP dissociation from the inhibitory site of ATPase exist; one is spontaneous dissociation and the second is ATP-dependent dissociation through the formation of the ternary complex between ADP, the enzyme and ATP. ADP-induced inactivation and ATP-dependent activation of ATPase activity of submitochondrial particles is accompanied by the same directed change of their ability to catalyse the ATP-dependent reverse electron transport from succinate to NAD+. The possible implication of the model suggested is discussed in terms of functional role of the inhibitory high-affinity binding site for ADP in the mitochondrial ATPase.
