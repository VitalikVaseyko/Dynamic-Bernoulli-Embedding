The effects of isoprenaline administration (300 micrograms/kg for 5 weeks) on rat soleus muscle capillarity and glycolytic and oxidative capacities were evaluated. The treatment resulted in ventricular hypertrophy. The activities of lactic dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase, and cytochrome c oxidase in soleus muscle homogenates were not different between control and isoprenaline-injected animals. Capillaries were visualized in muscle cross sections treated to demonstrate ATPase activity after acid preincubation. Capillary density was higher in the experimental (873 +/- 38 capillaries/mm2) than in the control (713 +/- 33 capillaries/mm2) animals. Capillary to fiber ratio was also higher in the experimental (2.47 +/- 0.10) than in control (2.09 +/- 0.08) animals, but fiber cross-sectional area was not changed by the treatment (2836 +/- 87 microns2 in controls and 2951 +/- 136 microns2 in experimental). A plot of capillary to fiber ratio vs. fiber cross-sectional area showed that at a given fiber cross-sectional area the value of capillary to fiber ratio of the treated animals was higher than that of the controls. This indicates that treatment resulted in the proliferation of microvessels. The results suggest that prolonged beta-adrenergic stimulation results in the development of new capillaries but that this is not accompanied by increases in the oxidative capacity of the soleus muscle of the rat.
