Isozyme pattern of pyruvate kinase in the liver of nude mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumor changed markedly during tumor growth. The change in isozyme pattern of pyruvate kinase was not due to infiltration or metastasis of tumor cells in the liver. Such a change in isozyme pattern of pyruvate kinase was also found in the liver of nude mice bearing canine gastric leiomyosarcoma induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), but not in the liver of nude mice bearing MNNG-induced canine gastric adenocarcinoma or human gastric adenocarcinoma.
