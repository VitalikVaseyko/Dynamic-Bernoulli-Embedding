A phospho-oligosaccharide which is the polar head group of a novel insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid has recently been involved in insulin action. We have investigated the insulin-like effects of this phospho-oligosaccharide on both glycogen phosphorylase a and pyruvate kinase activities of hepatocytes incubated in the presence of glucagon (0.1 nM). Similarly to insulin, the phospho-oligosaccharide antagonized glucagon-dependent activation of glycogen phosphorylase, as well as the inactivation of pyruvate kinase caused by this hormone. The antagonistic action of the phospho-oligosaccharide on glucagon effects was dose-dependent. Furthermore, it partially antagonized glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP levels. These results support the hypothesis that this phospho-oligosaccharide mediates at least some insulin actions in hepatocytes.
