Pyruvate kinase of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) shows positive cooperativity with respect to both substrates PEP and ADP. The temperature is a modulator of this activity, changing KS0.5 and Hill coefficient values for PEP. The enzyme shows alanine and ATP inhibition and F-1,6-P2 activation at 22 degrees C. F-1,6-P2 eliminates the effect of alanine but not that of ATP. These results could indicate a regulation of this enzyme by temperature and possess kinetic properties which are similar to that of L-type mammals.
