Most abdominal disorders present with a limited number of overlapping symptoms. Blood tests are not routinely available for use in diagnosis and so investigation tends to require complex imaging procedures or endoscopy and biopsy. These are invasive for the patient, may be associated with morbidity and mortality and have considerable resource implications. Biochemical tests on a single sample of faeces are therefore a valuable alternative. Measurement of faecal calprotectin has been shown to have a role in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and in its monitoring. Lactoferrin is also of benefit used in this way. Faecal elastase has been demonstrated to be of use in the diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency. A number of faecal markers have been explored in colorectal cancer. Faecal occult blood testing is used for population screening, but the metabolomic marker tumour, M2-pyruvate kinase, has potential for use in both diagnosis and screening. DNA testing has advantages in colorectal cancer but the exact applications of such tests require further evaluation.
