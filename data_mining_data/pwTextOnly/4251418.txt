Congenital hemolytic anemia in the Basenji dog resembles pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency in man as it is characterized by an abbreviated erythrocyte life span, an intense reticulocytosis, type II autohemolysis and splenomegaly. Glucose utilization and lactate production were inadequate with respect to the immature cell population. Analysis of enzymes involved in erythrocyte glycolysis revealed a deficiency of pyruvate kinase.
