Spirochaeta thermophila RI 19.B1 (DSM 6192) fermented glucose to lactate, acetate, CO2, and H2 with concomitant formation of cell material. The cell dry mass yield was 20.0 g/mol of glucose. From the fermentation balance data and knowledge of the fermentation pathway, a YATP of 9.22 g of dry mass per mol of ATP was calculated for pH-uncontrolled batch-culture growth on glucose in a mineral medium. Measurement of enzyme activities in glucose-grown cells revealed that glucose was taken up by a permease and then subjected to ATP-dependent phosphorylation by a hexokinase. Glucose-6-phosphate was further metabolized to pyruvate through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. The phosphoryl donor for phosphofructokinase activity was PPi rather than ATP. This was also found for the type strain of S. thermophila, Z-1203 (DSM 6578). PPi was probably formed by pyrophosphoroclastic cleavage of ATP, with recovery of the resultant AMP by the activity of adenylate kinase. All other measured kinase activities utilized ATP as the phosphoryl donor. Pyruvate was further metabolized to acetyl coenzyme A with concomitant production of H2 and CO2 by pyruvate synthase. Lactate was also produced from pyruvate by a fructose-1,6-diphosphate-insensitive lactate dehydrogenase. Evidence was obtained for the transfer of reducing equivalents from the glycolytic pathway to hydrogenase to produce H2. No formate dehydrogenase or significant ethanol-producing enzyme activities were detected.
