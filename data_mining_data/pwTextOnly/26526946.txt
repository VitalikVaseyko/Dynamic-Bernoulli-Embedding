The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is expressed preferentially in cancer cells over other pyruvate kinase isoforms. PKM2 is unique in its ability to be regulated allosterically by nutrients and growth signaling pathways, allowing cells to adapt their metabolic program to match physiological needs in different environments. Here, we discuss the role of pyruvate kinase M2 in glioma and in cancer metabolism.
