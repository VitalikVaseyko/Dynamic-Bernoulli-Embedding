Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from Streptococcus mutans strain JC2 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 180,000 to 190,000, and the enzyme was considered to consist of four identical subunits. This enzyme was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate for activity, and the saturation curve for activation by glucose 6-phosphate was sigmoidal. In the presence of 0.5 mM glucose 6-phosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP were hyperbolic, and the Km values were 0.22 and 0.39 mM, respectively. GDP, IDP, and UDP could replace ADP, and the Km for GDP (0.026 mM) was 0.067 of that for ADP. The enzyme required not only divalent cations, Mg2+ or Mn2+, but also monovalent cations, K+ or NH4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by Pi. When the concentration of Pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and Hill coefficient for glucose 6-phosphate increased. However, the enzyme was immediately inactivated in a solution without Pi. The intracellular concentration of glucose 6-phosphate, in cooperation with that of Pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in S. mutans.
