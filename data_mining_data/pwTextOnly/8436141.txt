Pyruvate kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus is an allosteric enzyme activated by AMP or ribose 5-phosphate but not by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The gene for the enzyme was cloned in Escherichia coli and its entire nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 587 residues and the molecular mass was calculated to be 62 317 Da. The sequence was highly similar to other pyruvate kinases, indicating that they have the same evolutional origin. Similarly to the E. coli enzymes, the enzyme does not contain an N-terminal domain, in contrast to the eukaryotic pyruvate kinases. However, the Bacillus stearothermophilus enzyme had an extra C-terminal sequence consisting of about 110 amino acid residues. A phosphoenolpyruvate-binding motif, which is observed in pyruvate phosphate dikinase, phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system enzyme I and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, was present in the extra C-terminal sequence. There was an open reading frame upstream of the pyruvate kinase gene. The homology of the sequence showed that the gene encodes phosphofructokinase. Both phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase were expressed in E. coli cells, and the evidence suggesting that both genes constitute an operon is presented.
