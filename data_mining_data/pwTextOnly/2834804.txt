Glycogen phosphorylase (GP), Hexokinase (HK), Phosphofructokinase (PFK), Pyruvate kinase (PK) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities from skeletal muscle and liver were measured in Rana perezi for the four seasons of the year. Skeletal muscle showed a decrease in PFK, PK and LDH activity during winter and summer. Liver displayed an increase in GP activity in spring and in PK and LDH in autumn.
