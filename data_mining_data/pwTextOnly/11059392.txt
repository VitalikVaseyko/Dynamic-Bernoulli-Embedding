The influence of thyroxine on activity of enzymes of energy metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, laktate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome-c oxidase) and antioxidative system (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase) of neonatal piglet neutrophils was investigated. It has been found, that after durable injections of hormone (4 mg/kg body weight) the increase of glycolytic enzymes activities as well as aerobic energy pathway catalyzers took place. Simultaneously the augmentation of superoxide dismutase reaction occurred after the thyroxine treatment. Such effect might represent an important link in compensatory mechanism, which prevents the destructive action of reactive oxygen species.
