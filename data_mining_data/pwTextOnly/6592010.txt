To further investigate the erythroid nature of the two human erythroleukemia cell lines, K562 and HEL-60, and to define the ontogeny of pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes (R, M2) in developing human erythroid cells, we have studied the isozymic alterations, if any, during differentiation of these cell lines in vitro and normoblasts isolated from fetal liver in vivo. PK activity of erythroleukemic cell lines was intermediate between that observed in leukocytes and in fetal liver erythroblasts. These cell lines contained a high level of M2-PK, but R-PK was always present, albeit at low concentrations, in all the clones or subclones we studied. Erythroblasts from fetal liver were separated according to density on a Stractan gradient. R-PK levels were nearly constant in the different fractions, whereas M2-PK levels markedly decreased as the erythroblasts became mature and almost completely disappeared in late erythroid cells. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate the erythroid origin of these cell lines.
