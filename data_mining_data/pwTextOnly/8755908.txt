In Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, the pyk gene coding for pyruvate kinase and the pfk gene coding for phosphofructokinase formed a bicistronic operon transcribed into a 2.9-kb RNA. The nucleotide sequence of the pyk gene indicated that the encoded protein possessed an extra C-terminal domain with a potential phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent autophosphorylation site.
