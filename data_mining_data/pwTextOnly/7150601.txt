A study was performed to determine whether M1 and M2 pyruvate kinases were synthesized under the direction of one or two messenger RNAs. We compared M1 and M2 pyruvate kinases purified from fresh tissues with those neosynthesized under the direction of messenger RNAs from tissues synthesizing either M1 or M2. RNA was isolated from rat muscle, lung, spleen and kidney by ethanol precipitation in 7 M guanidium chloride, translated in rabbit reticulocyte system and newly-synthesized pyruvate kinase subunits were purified by microimmunoaffinity chromatography. Pyruvate kinase from fresh muscle and spleen was purified in one step by a similar process. Muscle and spleen RNA directed the synthesis of M subunits with molecular weights of approx. 61000 and 62000, respectively, the same as those of the corresponding fresh tissue monomers. In addition, peptide maps obtained by partial digestion of neosynthesized M1 and M2 with V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus confirmed that these polypeptides were clearly different.
