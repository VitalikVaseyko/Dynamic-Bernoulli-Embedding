Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are a commonly prescribed class of insulin sensitizing drugs that increase fatty acid re-esterification, in part through the induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4). Owing to the deleterious side effects of TZDs the identification of alternative approaches with which to increase PDK4 is essential. We recently demonstrated that epinephrine increases PDK4 expression through p38 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) dependent pathways in cultured adipose tissue from lean rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether acute epinephrine treatment, in vivo, can induce PDK4 mRNA expression in adipose tissue from obese, insulin resistant rats and if the reputed signaling pathways mediating this effect are intact. To this end we fed male Wistar rats a chow or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcals from fat) for 6 weeks. Rats were then injected with a weight-adjusted bolus of epinephrine and tissue harvested. Despite a blunted activation of p38 epinephrine increased PDK4 mRNA expression to a similar extent in adipose tissue from chow and HFD rats. 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling was not altered by the HFD. Similar to epinephrine, 2 h of swim exercise, an intervention that increases plasma catecholamines, also increased PDK4 mRNA levels to a similar extent in adipose tissue from both lean and HFD rats. Collectively these findings demonstrate, for the first time, that acute elevations in catecholamines induce PDK4 in adipose tissue from HFD rats, that this effect is likely independent of p38, a reputed mediator of PDK4 expression and that exercise, similar to TZDs can induce PDK4 in adipose tissue from obese, insulin resistant rats.
