Muscular glycolytic fuels, intermediates and end-products (glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, pyruvate, lactate), Krebs cycle intermediates (citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate), related free amino acids (glutamate, alanine), ammonia, energy store (creatine phosphate), energy mediators (ATP, ADP, AMP) and energy charge potential were evaluated. Furthermore the maximum rate (Vmax) of the following muscular enzyme activities was evaluated in the crude extract and/or mitochondrial fraction: for the anaerobic glycolytic pathway: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase; for the tricarboxylic acid cycle: citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; for the electron transfer chain: total NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase. The rat gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed in normoxia and after repeated, alternate hypoxic and normoxic exposures (12 hours of hypoxia daily; for 5 days). Naftidrofuryl was administered daily at three different doses: 10, 15 and 22.5 mg/kg i.m., 30 min before the beginning of the experimental hypoxia. The biochemical adaptation to intermittent normobaric hypoxic-normoxic exposures was characterized by the decrease of the muscular contents of creatine phosphate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate. This adaptation occurred in absence of significant changes in the Vmax of the muscle enzymes tested. By naftidrofuryl treatment, in gastrocnemius muscle from hypoxic rats both alpha-ketoglutarate and creatine phosphate contents maintained normal values, while glutamate concentration remained reduced to subnormal values. With the exception of hexokinase, naftidrofuryl treatment did not modify the Vmax of marker enzymes related to energy transduction.
