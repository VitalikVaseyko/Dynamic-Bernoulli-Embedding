The influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.75 micrograms g1; insulin, 1.5 micrograms g-1; glucagon, 1.25 micrograms g-1 and their combinations on the activities of hepatic pyruvate kinase (PK) and malic enzymes (ME) was monitored. Male CD2F1 mice were treated toward the end of the light or dark periods, 9 or 23 hours after lights on (9 or 23 HALO), and subgroups of six mice were killed at 4, 8 or 12 hr post-treatment. PK and ME activities from control mice were well characterized by cosine curves. The PK activity was maximal when ME activity was minimal at the transition from light to dark (9 HALO plus 4 hr) and PK was at a minimum when ME was highest (23 HALO plus 4 hr). Both enzymes were influenced by at least one peptide hormone, and the effects were strongly circadian-stage dependent. The only effect attributed to EGF was an increase of PK activity (23%) 12 hr after injection at 23 HALO. PK activity was increased by insulin (23%) at 23 HALO (4 hr after injection), but not at 9 HALO, and decreased (17%) by glucagon 12 hr after injection at 9 HALO. Several reductions in PK activity in response to various combinations of peptides were observed, and appeared to be caused by glucagon but influenced by insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
