Two experiments were performed to examine the effects of intramuscular estradiol administration on the hepatic specific activities of some enzymes of lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in the immature fowl. Estradiol increased the specific activities of the hepatic lipogenic enzymes, ATP citrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP), but had no effects on the activities of the glycolytic, gluconeogenic and amino acid metabolising enzymes except for pyruvate kinase and glutamate dehydrogenase which were reduced in activity in both experiments. The results indicate that the estrogen-induced increase in hepatic lipid biosynthesis is due to a specific effect on lipid metabolism and not to a general increase in liver metabolism.
