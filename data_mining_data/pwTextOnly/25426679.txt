Most cancer cells undergo characteristic metabolic changes that are commonly referred to as the Warburg effect, with one of the hallmarks being a dramatic increase in the rate of lactic acid fermentation. This leads to the production of protons, which in turn acidifies the microenvironment surrounding tumors. Cancer cells have acquired resistance to acid toxicity, allowing them to survive and grow under these detrimental conditions. Kidney type glutaminase (GLS1), which is responsible for the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, produces ammonia as part of its catalytic activities and has been shown to modulate cellular acidity. In this study, we show that tissue, or type 2, transglutaminase (TG2), a gamma-glutamyl transferase that is highly expressed in metastatic cancers and produces ammonia as a byproduct of its catalytic activity, is up-regulated by decreases in cellular pH and helps protect cells from acid-induced cell death. Since both TG2 and GLS1 can similarly function to protect cancer cells, we then proceeded to demonstrate that treatment of a variety of cancer cell types with inhibitors of each of these proteins results in synthetic lethality. The combination doses of the inhibitors induce cell death, while individual treatment with each compound shows little or no ability to kill cells. These results suggest that combination drug treatments that simultaneously target TG2 and GLS1 might provide an effective strategy for killing cancer cells.
