In patients originally genotyped as homoallelic for the Gaucher disease (GD) L444P (1448C) mutation, we sought to confirm previously reported phenotypic differences between Caucasians and Japanese, to determine the prevalence and phenotypic impact of recombinant alleles, and to explore the phenotypic influence of genetic background. We therefore analyzed data from longer-term clinical follow-up, more comprehensive genotyping and polymorphism and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing in all known Japanese L444P homozygotes (n=15). Our studies demonstrated that, of 12 patients in our series originally diagnosed with non-neuronopathic GD, 9 developed neurological signs/symptoms during follow-up (at a mean of 14 years 11 months +/- 11 years 4 months). Of three patients originally diagnosed with acute neuronopathic (type 2) GD, all three were compound heterozygotes for L444P and the complex allele RecNci I. In the entire series, Pvu II and liver erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PKLR) polymorphism and prevalence of the 9 bp mtDNA deletion were heterogeneous, and these background genetic factors could not predict phenotypic expression. Our data suggest that, in Japanese as in Caucasian patients, the L444P/L444P genotype is highly associated with subacute neuronopathic (type 3) GD, and the presence of a complex allele together with an L444P allele leads to type 2 disease. Our findings also underline the importance of comprehensive genotyping (particularly testing for recombinant alleles), long-term follow-up and careful neurological examination in patients with early-onset GD. Such measures ultimately may improve genotype/phenotype correlations and, with them, genetic counseling and therapeutic decision making.
