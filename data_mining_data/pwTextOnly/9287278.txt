Experiments were performed on eight subjects affected by peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) of the lower limbs. Each patient was submitted to Ecodoppler, angiography and the "Treadmill test". Two bioptic muscle of these patients. A sample was used for the spectrophotometric and spectrophotofluorimetric determinations of: glycogen, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, malate, aspartate, glutamate, AMP, ADP, ATP and creatine phosphate (CP). The other bioptic sample was used to determine the following enzyme activities: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, total NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Patients showed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase, total NADH cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, a decrease in glycogen, ATP and CP concentrations. Telethermographic data showed patient muscle thermic emission quantitatively different from control group. The telethermographic test can be used as an additional diagnostic tool to determine and monitor the efficiency of a muscle undergoing metabolic failure.
