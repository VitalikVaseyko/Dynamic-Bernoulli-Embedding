By comparing protein profiles of nasopharyngeal carcinoma HONE1 cells to transformed nasopharyngeal epithelial NP 69 cells, several clusters of differentially expressed proteins were identified. The increased expression of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and pyruvate kinase M2 was a common feature in four NPC cell lines compared to the two transformed epithelial cell lines. Suppression of CK8 was associated with the sensitivity to cisplatin in HONE1 cells; while overexpression of CK8 provided resistance to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis; and this protection occurred through an enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK). Our findings implicate an underlying molecular mechanism in which CK8 is required for cisplatin resistance.
