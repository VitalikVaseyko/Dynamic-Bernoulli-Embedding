Activity levels of enzymes of glycolytic pathway viz., hexokinase (EC.2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase (EC.2.7.1.11), aldolase (EC.4.1.2.13), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC.1.2.1.12), enolase (EC.4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (EC.2.7.1.40) and lactate dehydrogenase (EC.1.1.1.27) were estimated in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and brainstem of the rats treated with subacute and acute doses of ammonium acetate and compared with those of control animals. In general, the activities of all the enzymes except for hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase, were elevated in all the three regions of the brain. The results suggests an enhanced rate of glycolysis in brain in hyperammonemic states and strengthens the role of ammonium ion in stimulating certain enzymes of the glycolytic pathway.
