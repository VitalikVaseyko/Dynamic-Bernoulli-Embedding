Several investigators have reported lipid A as the biologically active unit in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. To determine if lipid A was responsible for the reported increases in pyruvate kinase, mice were injected with endotoxin from Salmonella typhimurium SR-11, the Re mutant of Salmonella minnesota R 595, and lipid A-bovine serum albumin conjugate. The livers were homogenized and the activity of pyruvate kinase was measured. Similar increases in enzyme were obtained with all three preparations. These data imply that the lipid portion of the LPS molecule was responsible for alterations in host enzyme activity. To further determine if the lipid portion was the active unit, a lipid-degraded endotoxin (endotoxoid) prepared by potassium methylate treatment was inoculated into mice. An initial increase in liver pyruvate kinase activity was observed with all preparations. The marked increase observed at 16 h with the native product and lipid A conjugate was not obtained with the endotoxoid. These experiments extend and confirm previous observations that lipid A is responsible for the effects associated with LPS. Animals tolerant to endotoxin from S. typhimurium SR-11 were challenged with endotoxin from the Re mutant. A significant increase in pyruvate kinase activity was not obtained, suggesting that anti-O antibodies are not important in the development of tolerance.
