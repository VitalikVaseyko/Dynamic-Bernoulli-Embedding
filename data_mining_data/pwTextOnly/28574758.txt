Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central defect in cells creating the Warburg and reverse Warburg effect cancers. However, the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer has not yet been clearly explained. Decrease of mitochondrial oxidative energy production to about 50 % in comparison with healthy cells may be caused by inhibition of pyruvate transfer into mitochondrial matrix and/or disturbed H(+) ion transfer across inner mitochondrial membrane into cytosol. Lowering of the inner membrane potential and shifting of the working point of mitochondria to high values of pH above an intermediate point causes reorganization of the ordered water layer at the mitochondrial membrane. The reorganized ordered water layers at high pH values release electrons which are transferred to the cytosol rim of the layer. The electrons damp electromagnetic activity of Warburg effect cancer cells or fibroblasts associated with reverse Warburg effect cancer cells leading to lowered electromagnetic activity, disturbed coherence, increased frequency of oscillations and decreased level of biological functions. In reverse Warburg effect cancers, associated fibroblasts supply energy-rich metabolites to the cancer cell resulting in increased power of electromagnetic field, fluctuations due to shift of oscillations to an unstable nonlinear region, decreased frequency and loss of coherence.
