Tumor cells are known for their propensity to proliferate uncontrollably and generate multitudes of metastatic masses at the advanced stages of cancer. During this progression, tumor cells switch their energy source from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to a glucose-dependent glycolytic pathway, despite the availability of oxygen. Consequently, tumor cells increase their metabolic rates as well as glucose uptake to maintain their proliferation. This atypical metabolic phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect, which has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer and serves as a promising target for diagnosis and therapy of cancer. In this review, we summarize the current advances toward the development of glucose-derived therapeutic and diagnostic agents (theranostics) of cancer.
