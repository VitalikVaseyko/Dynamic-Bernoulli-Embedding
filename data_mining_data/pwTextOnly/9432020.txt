A child of Italian origin with a congenital haemolytic anaemia had spectrophotometrically undetectable erythrocyte adenylate kinase (AK) activity. Her parents and brother had approximately 50% normal AK activity, and AK electrophoresis of red blood cell (RBC) crude extract on cellulose acetate strips showed the presence of the normal allele AK1-1. No AK band was detected in the AK electrophoresis of the proband, in whom the erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations were normal whereas adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, pyruvate kinase (PK) and glucose-6P-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities were increased, reflecting the high reticulocyte count (6.9%). No other evident enzymatic defect was detected by standard procedures. Analysis of AK gene exons, based on polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), clearly showed an abnormality in the fragment containing exon 6. The subsequent sequence analysis of this abnormal fragment revealed homozygous and heterozygous A-->G substitutions in the proband and in the parents and brother respectively at codon 164, corresponding to a tyrosine-->cysteine substitution in the AK protein.
