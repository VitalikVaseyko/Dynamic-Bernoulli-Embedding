Ethacrynic acid stimulates in vitro concentration dependent renal gluconeogenesis from substrates which enter the gluconeogenic pathway at the level of the triosephosphates like glycerol or fructose or from substrates which have to pass the oxaloacetate shuttle like pyruvate or from intermediary products of fatty acid oxydation or citrate cycle. Our results suggest that a site of action of ethacrynic acid in this metabolic aspect is the enzyme system fructose diphosphatase/frutose-6-phosphate kinase and eventually additionally pyruvate carboxylase.
