A potent, heat-stable protein inhibitor of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) phosphatase has been identified and purified to near homogeneity from bovine kidney mitochondria (Damuni, Z., Humphreys, J. S., and Reed, L. J., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). This protein is a noncompetitive inhibitor of BCKDH phosphatase, with a Ki about 0.13 nM. By contrast, this protein inhibitor did not affect the activity of the cytosolic protein phosphatase-1 and phosphatase-2A or the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) phosphatase at concentrations up to 10 nM. The cytosolic protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2 had no effect on the activity of BCKDH phosphatase or PDH phosphatase at concentrations up to 50 and 300 nM respectively. These results, together with previous evidence, demonstrate that BCKDH phosphatase and its inhibitor protein are distinct from the cytosolic protein phosphatase-1 and phosphatase-2A and from protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2, respectively.
