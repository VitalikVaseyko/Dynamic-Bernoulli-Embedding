In vitro incubation of key glycolytic enzymes in supernatant fluids from rabbit kidney medulla with increasing concentrations of sodium laurate resulted in progressive inhibition of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. A corresponding reduction in the production of lactate from glucose was also observed. The possible effects of these enzyme inhibitions on the naturesis observed during fasting are discussed.
