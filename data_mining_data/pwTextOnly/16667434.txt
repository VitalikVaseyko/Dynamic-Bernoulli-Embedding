A phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) phosphatase was purified to homogeneity from germinating mung beans (Vigna radiata). It was found to be a tetrameric protein (molecular mass 240,000 daltons) made up of apparently identical subunits (subunit molecular mass 60,000 daltons). It was free from bound nucleotides. It did not show pyruvate kinase activity. The enzyme showed high specificity for PEP. Pyrophosphate and some esters (nucleoside di- and triphosphates) were hydrolyzed slowly and phosphoric acid monoesters were not hydrolyzed. The enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 8.5. At this pH, the K(m) of PEP was 0.14 millimolar and the V(max) was equal to 1.05 micromoles pyruvate formed per minute per milligram enzyme protein. Dialysis of the enzyme against 10 millimolar triethanolamine buffer (pH 6.5), led to loss of the catalytic activity, which was restored on addition of Mg(2+) ions (K(m) = 0.12 millimolar). Other divalent metal ions inhibited the Mg(2+) -activated enzyme. PEP-phosphatase was inhibited by ATP and several other metabolites.
