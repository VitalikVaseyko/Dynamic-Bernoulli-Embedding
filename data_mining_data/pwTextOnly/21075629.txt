We describe the discovery of small molecule benzazepine derivatives as agonists of human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) that displayed excellent selectivity over the PPARalpha and PPARgamma subtypes. Compound 8 displayed good PK in the rat and efficacy in upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) mRNA in human primary myotubes, a biomarker for increased fatty acid oxidation.
