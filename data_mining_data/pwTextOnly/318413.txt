1. The effect of sustained (48 hr) oxygen depletion on tissue (brain, heart, skeletal muscle) pyruvate kinase (PyKi) activities was examined in the pond turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans). 2. PyKi activities in skeletal muscle are significantly increased (from 322 +/- 84 to 450 +/- 95) following 48 hr of tissue hypoxia. PyKi activities in brain may already be elevated under ambient conditions but do not change following prolonged submersion (334 +/- 75 vs 325 +/- 77). Cardiac muscle PyKi is actually decreased (from 135 +/- 35 to 94 +/- 18) under anaerobic conditions. 3. The data suggest that prolonged O2 depletion may increase PyKi biosynthesis in turtle skeletal muscle (subserving enhanced glycolysis), but also demonstrate that factors other than oxygen availability are involved in the regulation of tissue PyKi activities in intact vertebrates.
