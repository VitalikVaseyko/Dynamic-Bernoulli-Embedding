Alterations in the activities of enzymes related to energy metabolism in canine lymphoma cells were investigated. Cytosolic pyruvate kinase (PK) and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activities in lymphoma cells were significantly higher than those in lymphocytes obtained from lymph nodes of healthy dogs, whereas cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was significantly lower in lymphoma cells. The cytosolic M/L ratio (MDH activity/LDH activity), which is considered to be a good indicator of energy metabolism related to glucose utilization in animal tissues, was significantly higher in lymphoma cells than in the normal lymphocytes.
