This study was conducted to determine the time course of metabolic changes associated with a switch from a high-fat to a low-fat diet in rats. Adult rats, maintained on a high-fat diet (42% of energy from fat) for 4-5 weeks were switched to a low-fat diet (11% of energy from fat), and the activities of several liver enzymes were followed. Three different phases could be distinguished. The early phase, complete by 2 days after the switch in diets, included an increase in the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (pentose phosphate pathway), an increase in pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities (terminal end of the glycolytic pathway) and an increase in ATP-citrate lyase and fatty acid synthetase (fatty acid synthesis pathway). The early phase also included a decrease in the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, gluconeogenesis) and a lower branched-chain amino acid dehydrogenase activity (BCAADH, branched-chain amino acid degradation). The concentration of the allosteric phosphofructokinase regulator, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2, glycolysis), decreased during the early phase. An intermediate phase could also be discerned between 3 and 10 days after the switch in diets. In this phase, the decreased Fru-2,6-P2 concentration and the decreased PEPCK and BCAADH activities observed in the early phase were reversed. The late phase occurred 10 days after the dietary switch and was characterized by an increase in the activities of glucokinase (glycolytic pathway) and glycogen phosphorylase (associated with glycogenolysis) and by a decrease in glutamate dehydrogenase, PEPCK and BCAADH activities. These measurements indicate that at least 20 days are required before metabolic changes associated with a switch in diet are complete.
