AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the resveratrol with gliclazide and losartan in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups of seven rats each. Diabetes was induced with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). Rats with blood glucose levels above 250 mg/dl after 48 h of streptozotocin injection were included in the diabetic group. Gliclazide and resveratrol were administered for 3 weeks at 5 mg/kg per day and losartan was administered for 3 weeks at 30 mg/kg per day in an oral aqueous suspension. At the end of the third week all rats were euthanized and fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and the metabolic activity of the hepatic enzymes hexokinase and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase were measured in tail blood and liver specimens. All parameters were quantified using an ELISA plate reader. RESULTS: Resveratrol and gliclazide significantly reduced both blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels in diabetic rats (p < 0.001). However, losartan did not exhibit the same effects (p < 0.05). The enzymatic activity of the liver enzymes hexokinase, glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose 1,6-biphosphatase, pyruvate kinase and glucose-6 phosphatase were enhanced by resveratrol and gliclazide, while losartan treatment was not associated with significant changes in liver carbohydrate metabolism. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol was not effective in improving liver carbohydrate metabolism relative to gliclazide, a drug widely used to treat diabetes. Dose-response profile of resveratrol remains indeterminate and additional studies may be necessary to determine effective dosing in diabetes.
