Eight-week-old, female Wistar fatty rats and their lean littermates were given a 30% sucrose solution in addition to a laboratory chow diet and water for 7 weeks. The fatty rats were hyperinsulinemic and hyperlipidemic, but normoglycemic when they drank only water. The hepatic activities of insulin-inducible glucokinase (GK), pyruvate kinase (PK), and malic enzyme (ME) were higher in the fatty rats than in the lean rats, whereas the insulin-suppressible glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity was similar in both types of rats, indicating the normal response of hepatic enzymes to hyperinsulinemia in the fatty rats. When they drank the sucrose solution, the fatty rats, but not the lean rats, developed hyperglycemia over 200 mg/dl. Plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations increased in both types of rats. Although the hepatic activities of GK, PK, and ME in the lean rats, and PK and ME in the fatty rats increased in response to the increase in plasma insulin, GK activity decreased in the fatty rats. On the other hand, G6Pase activity increased in both types of rats. As a result, the G6Pase/GK ratio, which may reflect net glucose handling in the liver, increased twofold in the fatty rats, but did not alter in the lean rats. From these findings, we conclude that sucrose ingestion induces an increase in hepatic glucose production through derangement of the hepatic enzyme profile and that the resultant decrease in hepatic glucose handling may be one of the pathogenic factors participating in the development of hyperglycemia in Wistar fatty rats.
