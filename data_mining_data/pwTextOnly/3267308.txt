In primary human brain tumours a shift occurs in the synthesis of isoenzymes of pyruvate kinase from the M towards the K-type. In astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas, which were localised in the cerebral hemispheres of adult patients over 20 years of age, the shift correlated well with histological grading and growth rate as observed in postoperative survival. Gliomas of adults, localised in midline structures, as well as childrens gliomas were characterised too by a strong shift from M towards the K type. However, in these tumours, less correlation with histological grading and growth rate was found. The isoenzyme shift can be rapidly demonstrated with an alanine inhibition test. The application of this assay may have a diagnostic value during operation for gliomas in grading of malignancy in adults as well as demarcation of the resection of gliomas in all age groups. The test can be performed within 10-15 min and can thus fit easily into a surgical procedure. A case report is presented for illustration.
