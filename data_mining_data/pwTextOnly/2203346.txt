We produced transgenic mice carrying about 3 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence of the rat pyruvate kinase L gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) structural gene. Expression of the transgene was observed only in tissues in which the endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase is expressed. Dietary glucose or insulin induced similar increases in the levels of CAT and L-type pyruvate kinase mRNAs in the liver. However, the fructose-induced level of CAT mRNA was about 3- and 6- fold lower than those of endogenous L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA in the liver and kidney, respectively, confirming our previous finding that stabilization of the transcripts of the pyruvate kinase L gene is an important regulatory step in fructose induction, especially in the kidney. Thus we conclude that all the cis-acting elements responsible for tissue-specific expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase and its stimulation by dietary components and insulin are localized in the sequence from about nucleotide -3000 to +37 in the pyruvate kinase L gene.
