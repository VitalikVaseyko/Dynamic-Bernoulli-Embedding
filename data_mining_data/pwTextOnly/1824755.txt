6-Phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) of rat placenta was purified to homogeneity with a recovery of 56% of the enzyme activity in the original extract. The purified enzyme is a tetramer and the Mr value of the subunit is 85,000 +/- 1500 as shown by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Considering the properties of the native rat placental PFK isoenzyme, it is clear that this tissue is a complex mixture of homotetramer and heterotetramer. Purified placenta PFK displayed little cooperativity at pH 7.0 with respect to fructose 6-phosphate and was markedly inhibited with high concentrations of ATP. The affinity of the enzyme for fructose 6-phosphate was increased by fructose 2,6-biphosphate. The purified enzyme was highly inhibited by citrate, whereas it was only slightly inhibited by phosphoenol pyruvate. ADP, AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate showed little stimulation towards placental PFK. The present study suggests that the placental PFK is a relatively active enzymic form and it is also probably characterized with a high rate of glycolysis possibly because this tissue requires a high energy production for the development and maintenance of the fetus as the placenta tends to be a semipermeable membrane through which substances are exchanged between mother and fetus.
