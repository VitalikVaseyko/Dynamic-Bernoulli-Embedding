1. By monitoring changes of fluorescence of NADH the frequencies, amplitudes and maximum slopes of the glycolytic oscillator of Phormia were analyzed in 5, 9, 15 and 21-day-old male flies. 2. In order to evaluate the possible existence of circadian rhythms within the oscillatory system, all determinations were repeated eight times/day. 3. In addition, the activities of three key enzymes of glycolysis, PFK, GAPDH and PK, which are central to the glycolytic oscillator were measured with respect to age and day time. 4. With increasing age the amplitudes of oscillations increased together with the maximum slopes of the oscillatory waves. The frequency appeared to be independent of age. 5. Variations of enzyme activities over the day indicated an age dependent circadian rhythm which, due to the simultaneous activity changes of the three measured enzymes, was not reflected in the whole oscillatory system. 6. The results suggest that modifications in the allosteric regulation of enzymes are responsible for the age dependent changes of the glycolytic oscillator.
