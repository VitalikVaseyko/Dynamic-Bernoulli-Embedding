Cryptobia salmositica (pathogenic and vaccine strains), Cryptobia bullocki (pathogenic), and Cryptobia catostomi (nonpathogenic) have similar oxygen consumption rates (0.17 +/- 0.01 nm O2/10(6) parasites). Incubation with sodium azide (5 microliters of a 1-M solution to 1 ml of parasite suspension, i.e., a 5-mM final concentration) reduced the oxygen consumption by approximately 4.5-fold. Motility of the parasites was also greatly reduced in sodium azide. The oxygen consumption and motility of the parasites returned to preazide treatment levels when the azide was removed even after 24 hr of incubation in sodium azide. The activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and cytochrome C oxidase were not detected in the 3 species of Cryptobia.
