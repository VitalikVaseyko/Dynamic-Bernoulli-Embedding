Analogues of adenine nucleotides, containing an additional chloromethyl-pyrimidone ring fused to the purine base, were obtained by treatment of AMP, ADP and ATP with an alpha-acetylenic ester, methyl 4-chlorobut-2-ynoate. These compounds were tested for their ability to substitute for the natural substrates or cofactors of several enzymes. With the ADP analogue, pyruvate kinase showed a significant increase of the Km value and a moderate decrease of V, while the reverse was observed when hexokinase was tested with modified ATP. Adenylate kinase was active with the ATP analogue but not with the AMP derivative. Myosin accepted the ATP analogue as a substrate, but was irreversibly modified. Among the dehydrogenases tested, only glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was inhibited by the nucleotide analogue. The structure--activity relationship of these nucleotide derivatives, which represent the largest dimensional deviation known from natural nucleotides, is discussed in comparison with some earlier described dimensional probes of enzyme-nucleotide binding sites.
