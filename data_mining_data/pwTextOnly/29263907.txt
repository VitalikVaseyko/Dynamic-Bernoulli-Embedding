The underlying anticancer effects of butyrate, an end-product of the intestinal microbial fermentation of dietary fiber, remain elusive. Here, we report that butyrate promotes cancer cell apoptosis by acting as a SIRT3 inhibitor. Butyrate inhibits SIRT3 both in cultured cells and in vitro. Butyrate-induced PDHA1 hyperacetylation relieves the inhibitory phosphorylation of PDHA1 at serine 293, thereby activating an influx of glycolytic intermediates into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and reversing the Warburg effect. Meanwhile, butyrate-induced hyperacetylation inactivates complex I of the electron transfer chain and prevents the utilization of TCA cycle intermediates. These metabolic stresses promote apoptosis in hyperglycolytic cancer cells, such as HCT116p53(-/-) cells. SIRT3 deacetylates both PDHA1 and complex I. Genetic ablation of Sirt3 in mouse hepatocytes abrogated the ability of butyrate to induce apoptosis. Our results identify a butyrate-mediated anti-tumor mechanism and indicate that the combined activation of PDC and inhibition of complex I is a novel tumor treatment strategy.
