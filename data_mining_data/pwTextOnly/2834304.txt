A study on the enzyme activity of glucose metabolism in the lymphocytes of patients with solid malignant tumors is reported. The results have shown a 30% mean increase of the hexokinase (HK) activity in patients with solid malignant tumors as compared to the mean value observed in a group of healthy subjects. A relationship between level of HK increase and stage of tumor was also observed. The other examined enzyme activities, phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate-kinase (PK), phosphoglycerate-kinase (PGK), phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PD), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) and enolase did not show significant changes. It is concluded that even though the use of HK as tumor marker cannot be hypothesized at the present time, a significant relation between an increased activity of this enzyme and presence of the tumor is unquestionable. Therefore, this biochemical effect induced away from the neoplastic tissue deserves further study.
