Male Wistar rats were starved and refed diets containing either 40% carbohydrate as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, invert sugar) or disaccharides (maltose, sucrose), or 42.2% carbohydrate as glucose. Induction of various liver enzymes and changes in total liver lipid levels by the different dietary sugars were studied. Liver enzymes measured included glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), malic enzyme (ME), phosphofructokinase (PFK), L-alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (LalphaGPD), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate cleavage enzyme (CCE), acetyl CoA carboxylase (AcCoAC), and fatty acid synthetase (FAS). The responses in enzyme activity to diets containing glucose or invert sugar were used as the basal response. Enzyme responses to refeeding the carbohydrate diets fell into three categories: (1) enzyme activity increased both by the disaccharide configuration of the carbohydrate and by fructose (G6PD, PK, CCE, AcCoAC, FAS); (2) enzyme activity increased only by the disaccharide configuration of the carbohydrate (6PGD, ME); and (3) enzyme activity increased only by fructose (PFK, LalphaGPD). Total liver lipid level was increased both by the disaccharide configuration of the carbohydrate and by fructose. Refeeding diets containing equal molar amounts of glucose or maltose did not abolish the disaccharide effect. The data indicate that the disaccharide configuration of maltose and sucrose may have an effect at the gastrointestinal level, which causes an increased induction of certain enzymes in the liver.
