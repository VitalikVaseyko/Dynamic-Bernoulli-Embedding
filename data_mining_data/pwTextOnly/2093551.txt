To explore the early diagnostic effects of serum pyruvate kinase (PK) on myocardial infarct extension (MIE), the activity of serum PK, glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT), creatine kinase (CK) and its isoenzyme (CK-MB) were measured in 102 cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The results showed that the dynamic changes of PK were similar to that of CK-MB, but serum PK was 9.2 hours earlier than CK-MB in the determination of the onset of MIE. Furthermore we introduced MIE and AMI model by ligating the branch of coronary arteries in conscious dogs. Compare the pathologic findings with the PK dynamic changes showed that the double peak and plateau types were brought about by MIE. We believe that serial measuring of serum PK was helpful in the early diagnosis of MIE.
