Many types of human tumor cells have overexpressed pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). However, the mechanism underlying this increased PKM2 expression remains to be defined. We demonstrate here that EGFR activation induces PLCgamma1-dependent PKCepsilon monoubiquitylation at Lys321 mediated by RINCK1 ubiquitin ligase. Monoubiquitylated PKCepsilon interacts with a ubiquitin-binding domain in NEMO zinc finger and recruits the cytosolic IKK complex to the plasma membrane, where PKCepsilon phosphorylates IKKbeta at Ser177 and activates IKKbeta. Activated RelA interacts with HIF1alpha, which is required for RelA to bind the PKM promoter. PKCepsilon- and NF-kappaB-dependent PKM2 upregulation is required for EGFR-promoted glycolysis and tumorigenesis. In addition, PKM2 expression correlates with EGFR and IKKbeta activity in human glioblastoma specimens and with grade of glioma malignancy. These findings highlight the distinct regulation of NF-kappaB by EGF, in contrast to TNF-alpha, and the importance of the metabolic cooperation between the EGFR and NF-kappaB pathways in PKM2 upregulation and tumorigenesis.
