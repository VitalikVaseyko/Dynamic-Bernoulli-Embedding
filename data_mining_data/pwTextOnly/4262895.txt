1. Parenchymal cells have been prepared from mouse liver by enzymic and mechanical means. 2. The dry weights, protein and DNA contents of these cells have been determined. 3. Mouse liver ;M-' and ;L-type' pyruvate kinases have been prepared free of contamination with each other; their kinetic properties have been examined and a method has been developed for their assay in total liver homogenates. 4. Recoveries of phosphoglycerate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase in enzymically prepared cells indicate that little, if any, cytoplasmic protein is lost during preparation. 5. Parenchymal cells exhibit a very substantial increase in the activity ratio of glucokinase to hexokinase over that in total liver homogenate; in three out of eight experiments, hexokinase activity was undetectable. 6. ;L-type' pyruvate kinase alone occurs in the parenchymal cell. Non-parenchymal cells are characterized by the presence of ;M-type' activity only. 7. Parenchymal cells contain both glucose 6-phosphatase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. The non-parenchymal fraction appears to contain fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, but is devoid of glucose 6-phosphatase. 8. No aldolase A was detectable in the whole liver. Aldolase B occurs in both parenchymal and non-parenchymal tissue. 9. Parenchymal cells prepared by mechanical disruption of mouse liver with 20% polyvinyl alcohol exhibit a similar enzyme profile to those prepared enzymically. 10. The methodology involved in the preparation of isolated liver cells is discussed. The importance of the measurement of several parameters as criteria for establishing the viability of parenchymal cells is stressed. 11. The metabolic implications of the results in the present study are discussed.
