Studies of several enzyme activities and of some metabolites in erythrocytes of the newt Pleurodels waltilii are described. The results indicate that differences exist between enzyme activities in males and females and in diploid and triploid animals. Females have higher erythrocyte enzyme activities than males. However, triploid animals have lower enzyme activites in their erythrocytes than diploid animals; this observation is more striking in females than in males.
