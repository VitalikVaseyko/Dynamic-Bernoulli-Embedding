A simple mathematical model for glycolysis in erythrocytes is presented which takes into account ATP synthesis and consumption. The system is described by four ordinary differential equations. Conditions in vivo are described by a stable steady state. The model predicts correctly the metabolite concentrations found in vivo. The parameters involved are in agreement with data on the separate steps. The metabolite changes found in pyruvate kinase-deficient erythrocytes and the species variations among erythrocytes from different animals are described satisfactorily. The roles of the enzymes in the control of metabolites and glycolytic flux are expressed in the form of a control matrix and control strengths [R. Heinrich & T.A. Rapoport (1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 42, 89-95] respectively. Erythrocytes from various species are shown to be adapted to a maximal ATP-consumption rate. The calculated eigenvalues reveal the pronounced time-hierarchy of the glycolytic reactions. Owing to the slowness of the 2,3-bisphospho-glycerate phosphatase reaction, quasi-steady states occur during the time-interval of about 0.5-2h incubation, which are defined by perturbed 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentrations. The theoretical predictions agree with experimental data. In the quasi-steady state the flux control is exerted almost entirely by the hexokinase-phosphofructokinase system. The model describes satisfactorily the time-dependent changes after addition of glucose to starved erythrocytes. The theoretical consequences are discussed of the conditions in vitro with lactate accumulation and the existence of a time-independent conservation quantity for the oxidized metabolites. Even in this closed system quasi-steady states occur which are characterized by approximately constant concentrations of all glycolytic metabolites except for the accumulation of lactate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and triose phosphate.
