Administration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate with theophylline produced testosterone-like induction of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the seminal vesicles of both orchidectomized and immature rats. The N(6)-O(2)'-dibutyryl analog of this cyclic nucleotide produced greater increases in vesicular enzyme activities than those induced by the parent compound. The observed enhancement of the key glycolytic enzymes and of hexose monophosphate shunt dehydrogenase was significantly inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The evidence indicates that cyclic adenosine monophosphate may be involved as an intermediary in the action of androgenic hormones on male accessory sex organs.
