The CstA (the peptide transporter carbon starvation CstA family; TC# 2.A.114) family of peptide transporters belongs to the second largest superfamily of secondary transporters, the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily. No representative of the CstA family has previously been characterized either biochemically or structurally, but we have now identified the function of one of its members, the transport protein YjiY of Escherichia coli Expression of the yjiY gene is regulated by the LytS-like histidine kinase BtsS, a sensor of extracellular pyruvate, together with the LytTR-like response regulator BtsR. YjiY consists of 716 amino acids, which form 18 putative transmembrane helices. Transport studies with intact cells provided evidence that YjiY is a specific and high-affinity transporter for pyruvate (Km 16 muM). Furthermore, reconstitution of the purified YjiY into proteoliposomes revealed that YjiY is a pyruvate/H(+) symporter. It has long been assumed that E. coli possesses transporter(s) for pyruvate, but the present study is the first to definitively identify such a protein. Based on its function, we propose to rename the uncharacterized gene yjiY as btsT (for "Brenztraubensaure" transporter, from the German word for pyruvate).IMPORTANCE BtsT (formerly known as YjiY) is found in many commensal and pathogenic representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae This study for the first time characterizes a pyruvate transporter in Escherichia coli, BtsT, as a specific pyruvate/H(+) symporter. When nutrients are limiting, BtsT takes up pyruvate from the medium, thus enabling it to be used as a carbon source for the growth and survival of E. coli.
