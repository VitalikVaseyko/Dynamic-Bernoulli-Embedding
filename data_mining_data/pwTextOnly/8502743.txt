Activity and isoenzyme composition of certain enzymes of glycolysis of rat small intestine enterocytes was studied in the course of exposure to X radiation. Hexokinase activity was shown to increase significantly throughout the entire period of observation. Activity of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was inhibited at early (days 1-3) and increased at later (days 5-10) times of observation.
