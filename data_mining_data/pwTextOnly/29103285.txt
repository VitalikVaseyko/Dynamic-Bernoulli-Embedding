OBJECTIVE: This experiment was conducted to investigate whether asparagine (Asn) could improve liver energy status in weaning pigs when challenged with lipopolysaccharide. METHODS: Forty-eight weaned pigs (DurocxLarge WhitexLandrace, 8.12+/-0.56 kg) were assigned to four treatments: i) CTRL, piglets received a control diet and injected with sterile 0.9% NaCl solution; ii) lipopolysaccharide challenged control (LPSCC), piglets received the same control diet and injected with Escherichia coli LPS; iii) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+0.5% Asn, piglets received a 0.5% Asn diet and injected with LPS; and iv) LPS+1.0% Asn, piglets received a 1.0% Asn diet and injected with LPS. All piglets were fed the experimental diets for 19 d. On d 20, the pigs were injected intraperitoneally with Escherichia coli LPS at 100 mug/kg body weights or the same volume of 0.9% NaCl solution based on the assigned treatments. Then the pigs were slaughtered at 4 h and 24 h after LPS or saline injection, and the liver samples were collected. RESULTS: At 24 h after LPS challenge, dietary supplementation with 0.5% Asn increased ATP concentration (quadratic, p<0.05), and had a tendency to increase adenylate energy charges and reduce AMP/ATP ratio (quadratic, p<0.1) in liver. In addition, Asn increased the liver mRNA expression of pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase beta (linear, p<0.05; quadratic, p<0.05), and had a tendency to increase the mRNA expression of hexokinase 2 (linear, p<0.1). Moreover, Asn increased liver phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (pAMPK)/total AMP-activated protein kinase (tAMPK) ratio (linear, p<0.05; quadratic, p<0.05). However, at 4 h after LPS challenge, Asn supplementation had no effect on these parameters. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that Asn could improve the energy metabolism in injured liver at the late stage of LPS challenge.
