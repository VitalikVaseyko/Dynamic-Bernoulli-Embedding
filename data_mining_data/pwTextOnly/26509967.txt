Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) is useful in the preoperative diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs); however, the molecular characteristics of glucose metabolism of GIST are unknown. We evaluated 18F-FDG uptake on preoperative PET/CT of 40 patients and analyzed the expression of glycolytic enzymes in resected GIST tissues by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) cut-off value of 4.99 had a sensitivity of 89.5%, specificity was 76.2%, and accuracy of 82.5% for identifying tumors with a high risk of malignancy. We found that 18F-FDG uptake correlated positively with tumor size, risk grade, and expression levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Elevated HK and LDH activity was found in high-risk tumors. Among the isoforms of GLUT and HK, GLUT1 and HK1 expression increased with higher tumor risk grade. In addition, overexpression of glycolytic enzymes M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and LDHA was observed in GISTs, especially in high-risk tumors. These results suggest that upregulation of GLUT1, HK1, PKM2, and LDHA may play an important role in GIST tumorigenesis and may be useful in the preoperative prediction of malignant potential.
