The regulation of seed oil synthesis in rapeseed is largely unknown. In this study, Arabidopsis microarray was used to analyze the gene differential expression of the immature seeds 30 days after flowering of a high oil Brassica napus, H105, whose oil content was 46.04 +/- 1.42, 53.94 +/- 1.35 and 53.09 +/- 1.35% when planted in Nanjing (altitude: 8.9 m), Xining (altitude: 2261.2 m) and Lhasa (altitude: 3658 m), respectively. Transcript levels of 363 genes and 421 genes were altered twofold or more for H105 planted in Xining and Lhasa compared to that in Nanjing, respectively. Together, there were 53 common up-regulated and 42 common down-regulated expression transcripts shared by H105 planted in Xining and Lhasa compared to that in Nanjing. Some important genes, such as sucrose synthase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase which related to sugar metabolism were identified common up-regulated in higher oil content H105. These results revealed the expressional disciplinarian of correlative genes, and provided important information of the molecular genetic mechanism of oil content difference of rapeseed. In addition, these differential expression genes could be suitable as targets for genetic improvement of seed oil content.
