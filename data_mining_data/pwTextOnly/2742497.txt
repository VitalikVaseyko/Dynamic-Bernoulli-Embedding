Liver parenchymal cells from the periportal and centrilobular zones differ in their morphological, biochemical and functional characteristics. In an effort to obtain fractions enriched in either periportal or centrilobular cells, isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were separated into five subpopulations by centrifugal elutriation. The mean diameters of the cells present in fractions I-V were 19.6, 21.1, 21.8, 22.7 and 23.5 micron, respectively. The content of cytochrome P-450 as well as benzphetamine N-demethylase and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activities were higher in the larger parenchymal cells than in the smaller ones. After administration of phenobarbital the content of cytochrome P-450 was approximately two-fold greater in the cells present in fractions 3-5, when compared to the same subpopulations isolated from untreated rats; the activity of benzphetamine N-demethylase was enhanced to a similar extent in all five fractions. 3-Methylcholanthrene treatment resulted in a significant increase of cytochrome P-450 content and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in all five fractions: both parameters were slightly higher in fractions 4 and 5 than in fractions 1 and 2. In conclusion, the elutriated liver parenchymal cells seem to preserve the biochemical heterogeneity observed in the intact liver; the potential enrichment of periportal and centrilobular cells in the different fractions by centrifugal elutriation is discussed.
