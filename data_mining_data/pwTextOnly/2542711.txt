The incubation of isolated rat hepatocytes with vanadate increased the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate without modifying 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity. Vanadate also reverted and prevented the decrease of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, of the "active" form of the 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase and of the pyruvate kinase activity ratio produced by glucagon, by probably counteracting the increase in cyclic AMP concentration.
