In tissue culture, lens epithelia and iris cells survive concentrations of 0.5 mg pilocarpine/100 ml TCM, even better those of 0.25 mg/100 ml. By means of the Warburg-method and Boehringer's Glukotest, the consumption of oxygen and glucose were measured without and with the addition of pilocarpine. The oxygen-uptake of the epithelia decreased to one third after addition of the drug, while it doubled in the iris cells. This reveals a compensating effect of the iris tissue protecting the epithelia. Pilocarpine inhibited the consumption of glucose in both tissues, but not significantly. Consequently, we are not dealing with a cataractogenuous substance. This gives new light upon Hockwin's so-called "Additions-katarakt".
