Wing-polymorphic insects are excellent models for asking questions about trade-offs in physiology and life-history because of the existence of multiple morphs exhibiting numerous strategies living in one environment. We measured activities of select key enzymes in oxidative metabolism (citrate synthase), glycolysis (hexokinase, pyruvate kinase) and fatty acid oxidation (ss-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HOAD) in flying and non-flying long-winged bugs from two populations (ancestral and derived) of the wing-polymorphic soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma). In the ancestral population, flyers had significantly greater activities of citrate synthase, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and HOAD than non-flyers. In contrast, in the derived population, flyers and non-flyers showed no significant differences in the activities of any of the enzymes tested. There were no significant differences in activities of citrate synthase as a function of adult age (3-20 d) for either population. Short-winged bugs in the derived population had significantly lower citrate synthase activities than either of the two derived, long-winged morphs, however, they were analogous to the ancestral long-winged non-flyer. These results suggest an evolution of alternative flight strategies between the two populations.
