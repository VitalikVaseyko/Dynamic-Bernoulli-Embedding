The effect of cellular creatine (Cr) and adenine nucleotides (AdN) deficiency on cardiac work, ATP turnover rate and flux through creatine kinase (CK) has been investigated. Depletion of 60-65% of total heart AdN by 2-deoxyglucose treatment in the presence of pyruvate and subsequent washout resulted in only 25% decrease in contractile activity and phosphocreatine level. Substitution of 80-90% of heart Cr (and PCr) by guanidinopropionic acid (GP) by feeding of rats with 1% GP diet reduced maximal values of cardiac work, ATP turnover and flux through CK by 40-50% and elevated end diastolic pressure and index of diastolic stiffness. Hearts depleted of AdN or glycogen showed better post-ischemic recovery of mechanical function that can be attributed to restriction of accumulation of ischemic catabolytes (lactate, H+, Pi). These data imply that in myocardium PCr is an essential high energy phosphate and contractile function stays unchanged at significantly reduced ATP levels.
