Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 is a novel regulator of insulin-independent glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and has glucose and triglyceride lowering effects in rodent models of diabetes. In this study, we found that FGF-21 can significantly attenuate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced damage in H9c2 cells (rat heart). However, it is unclear which signal transduction pathway is involved in the cardioprotective effect of FGF-21. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the potential mechanism induced by FGF-21. The results showed that FGF-21 treatment prevented the oxidative stress and apoptosis associated with I/R damage by reducing the levels of superoxide anions, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3beta by activating Akt phosphorylation, and recovering the levels of ATP synthase pyruvate kinase isozymes M1 and protein kinase C, thereby improving energy supply. In summary, we conclude that FGF-21 protects H9c2 cells against I/R injury mainly through the Akt-GSK-3beta-caspase-3 dependent pathway, preventing oxidative stress, and recovery of the energy supply.
