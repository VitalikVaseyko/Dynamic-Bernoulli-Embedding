Key enzymes related to lipogenesis in the liver are induced by a high glucose diet or insulin and suppressed by starvation, diabetes, or glucagon. Most of these enzymes are also induced by dietary fructose, even in diabetic liver. This regulation occurs at the posttranscriptional level as well as at the transcriptional level. We studied extensively the molecular mechanism of induction of L-type pyruvate kinase (LPK). The transcription of the LPK gene in the liver was stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon. This insulin action required ongoing protein synthesis and metabolism of glucose and was enhanced by glucocorticoid. On the other hand, the mechanism of induction of the LPK by dietary fructose depended on plasma insulin levels. Dietary fructose stimulated transcription of the LPK gene in normal rats, whereas it acted mainly at the posttranscriptional level in diabetic rats. These fructose effects were attributable to a common metabolite of fructose and glycerol. The induction of LPK mRNA by dietary glucose was impaired in the liver of Wistar fatty rats, a model of obese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but fructose-induced accumulation of the mRNA was not. Studies on transgenic mice indicated that the 5'-flanking region up to -3 kb of the LPK gene contained all cis-acting elements necessary for tissue-specific expression of LPK and its stimulation by diets and insulin. Further analysis using a transient expression assay revealed the presence of three cis-acting elements necessary for expression of LPK in hepatocytes in the region up to -170 kb. However, these elements alone were not sufficient for dietary and hormonal regulation of this enzyme when analyzed in transgenic mice.
