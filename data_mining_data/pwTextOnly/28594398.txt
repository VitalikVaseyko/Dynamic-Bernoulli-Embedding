Recent advances in tumor metabolism have revealed that metabolic reprogramming could dramatically promote caner metastasis. However, the relation and mechanism between metastasis and metabolic reprogramming are not thoroughly explored. Cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion analysis were performed to evaluate the role of FAM210B in human cancer cells. Human ovarian cancer xenograft model was used to determine the effects of inhibiting FAM210B by shRNA on tumor metastasis. Microarray analysis was used to determine the target genes of FAM210B. FAM210B cellular localization was performed by mitochondria isolation and mitochondria protein extraction. To detect FAM210B-mediated metabolic reprogramming, oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were measured. Our previous study screened a novel cancer progression-suppressor gene, FAM210B, which encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, by the suppression of mortality by antisense rescue technique (SMART). Here we demonstrated that FAM210B loss was significantly associated with cancer metastasis and decreased survival in a clinical setting. Additionally, it was found that low expression of FAM210B was significantly correlated with decreased survival and enhanced metastasis in vivo and in vitro, and the loss of FAM210B led to an increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and reduced glycolysis through the downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which activated the EMT program and enhanced migratory and invasive properties. Collectively, our data unveil a potential metabolic target and mechanism of cancer metastasis.
