Pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.32) are essential regulatory enzymes of glucose oxidation in helminths, the PK/PEPCK branch point being the first divergent step between carbohydrate catabolism of the parasites and their hosts. Recently, PEPCK from the cestode parasite, Raillietina echinobothrida, has been purified and characterized. In order to find out the differential kinetics, if any, at PK/PEPCK branch point in the parasite, in this study, we purified and characterized the parasite PK and compared it with the parasite PEPCK. The purified PK displayed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Kmapp of 77.8 microM for its substrate PEP, whereas the Kmapp was 46.9 microM for PEPCK. PEP exhibited differential kinetics at PK/PEPCK branch point of the parasite and behaved as a homotropic effector for PEPCK, but not for PK. The inhibitory constant (Ki) for genistein and daidzein (phytochemicals from Flemingia vestita) was determined and discussed. From these results, we hypothesize that PK/PEPCK branch point is a probable site for anthelmintic action.
