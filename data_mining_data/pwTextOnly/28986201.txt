OBJECTIVE: To describe a new immunoprecipitation pattern identified in Italian patients affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc), corresponding to the pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex recognized by anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). METHODS: Autoantibodies in sera from 85 patients with SSc were tested by protein- and RNA-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot was used to determine the identified proteins, and medical records re-evaluated for liver function tests and PBC. RESULTS: In 13/85 (15%) SSc sera, a unique set of 75-50-40-34kD proteins that had not been previously reported, was noted. The four proteins were identified as the proteins X/E3BP, E1alpha, E1beta, and E2/E3 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex by immunoprecipitation-Western blot. From clinical record evaluation, 9/13 (69%) SSc patients with this new pattern were positive for AMA by routine indirect immunofluorescence, and 7/13 (54%) had a diagnosis of PBC, while 4/13 (31%) manifested no biochemical signs of cholestasis. Twelve of 13 patients with SSc and AMA by immunoprecipitation have a limited cutaneous form of SSc and anti-centromere antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a pattern of 4 proteins in 15% of SSc patients, identified for the first time by protein-immunoprecipitation. This pattern corresponds to serum AMA against the pyruvate dehydrogenase antigen complex and it must be considered in the interpretation of protein-immunoprecipitation results.
