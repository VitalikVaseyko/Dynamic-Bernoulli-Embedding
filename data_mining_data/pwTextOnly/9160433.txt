The activities of D-glucose transport (D-GT) and cytosolic enzymes were significantly higher in mammary adenocarcinoma of dogs than in mammary gland from normal dogs. The activities of D-GT in adenocarcinoma were over three-and-a-half times higher than in the controls. The K(m) value of the D-GT activity for glucose in both the adenocarcinoma and normal mammary gland was approximately 0.9 mM. The activities of the key glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, in the adenocarcinoma were also more than three-and-a-half times higher than in the controls. The increased activities of D-GT are considered to be accompanied by an acceleration of glucose utilisation in the adenocarcinoma of dogs.
