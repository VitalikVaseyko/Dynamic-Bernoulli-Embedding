The lysine synthesis by the culture M. glutamicus T-3 on nutrient media with varying molasses concentrations was studied during cultivation under different aeration conditions. With an increase in the nutrient concentration the relationship between the lysine yield and aeration rate became very manifest. An elevation of aeration (Kv) from 1.2 to 6.3 g O2 1/hr increased the yield of lysine in the 15, 20 and 28% molasses medium by 3, 6 and 11 times, respectively. A decline in aeration decreased the biomass yield and increased the content of lactic acid and alanine in the culture liquid (to 19 and 4 g/l, respectively). The rate of respiration of the culture in the filtrate of the culture liquid measured in the Warburg apparatus depended on the cell age and molasses concentration in the nutrient medium and not on the aeration rate.
