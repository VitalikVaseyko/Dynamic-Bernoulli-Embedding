A 12-month clinical study of Duchenne muscular dystrophy was carried out during a double-blind trial of allopurinol therapy. The disease was monitored by assessment of muscle power and function, pulmonary function tests, and electrocardiography. Biochemical assessments were made of plasma creatine kinase, pyruvate kinase, uric acid, and urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine and creatinine. Allopurinol did not alter the progression of the disease.
