Cancers cells strongly stimulate glycolysis and glutaminolysis for their biosynthesis. Pyruvate derived from glucose is preferentially diverted towards the production of lactic acid (Warburg effect). Citrate censors ATP production and controls strategic enzymes of anabolic and catabolic pathways through feedback reactions. Mitochondrial citrate diffuses in the cytosol to restore oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Whereas acetyl-CoA serves de novo lipid synthesis and histone acetylation, OAA is derived towards lactate production via pyruvate and / or a vicious cycle reforming mitochondrial citrate. This cycle allows cancer cells to burn their host's lipid and protein reserves in order to sustain their own biosynthesis pathways. In vitro, citrate has demonstrated anti-cancer properties when administered in excess, sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy. Understanding its central role is of particular relevance for the development of new strategies for counteracting cancer cell proliferation and overcoming chemoresistance.
