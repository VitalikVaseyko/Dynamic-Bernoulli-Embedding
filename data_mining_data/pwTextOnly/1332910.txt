Mutational damage of the fruK gene coding for fructose-1-phosphate kinase leads to 2-6-fold (depending on the strain) decrease in FEP synthase activity in Escherichia coli. The fruK mutants were unable to utilize lactate as well as fructose and fructose-1-phosphate, acquiring, in addition, sensitivity to mannose in their growth medium. Reversions back to FruK+ phenotype or introduction of an intact fruK allele resulted in restoration of both FEP synthase activity and the ability to grow on lactate.
