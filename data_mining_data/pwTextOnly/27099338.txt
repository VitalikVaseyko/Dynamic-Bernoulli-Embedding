Lysine acetylation is tightly coupled to the nutritional status of the cell, as the availability of its cofactor, acetyl-CoA, fluctuates with changing metabolic conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that acetyl-CoA levels act as an indicator of cellular nourishment, and increased abundance of this metabolite can block the induction of cellular recycling programmes. In the present study we investigated the cross-talk between mitochondrial metabolic pathways, acetylation and autophagy, using chemical inducers of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA production. Treatment of cells with alpha-lipoic acid (alphaLA), a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, led to the unexpected hyperacetylation of alpha-tubulin in the cytosol. This acetylation was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial citrate export (a source for mitochondria-derived acetyl-CoA in the cytosol), was dependent on the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase (alphaTAT) and was coupled to a loss in function of the cytosolic histone deacetylase, HDAC6. We further demonstrate that alphaLA slows the flux of substrates through autophagy-related pathways, and severely limits the ability of cells to remove depolarized mitochondria through PTEN-associated kinase 1 (PINK1)-mediated mitophagy.
