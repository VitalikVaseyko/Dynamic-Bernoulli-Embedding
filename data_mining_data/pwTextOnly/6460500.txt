A new variant of hereditary hemolytic anemia in a family due to high adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is reported. The increase in ATP levels varied from 83 to 105% in the family members. Low 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels and low 2,3-diphosphoglyceromutase activity were observed in three family members, with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase activity.
