This article presents the dynamic responses of several intra- and extracellular components of an aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to glucose and ethanol pulses within a time window of 75 sec. Even though the ethanol pulse cannot perturb the glycolytic pathway directly, a distinct response of the metabolites at the lower part of glycolysis was found. We suggest that this response is an indirect effect, caused by perturbation of the NAD/NADH ratio, which is a direct consequence of the conversion of ethanol into acetaldehyde. This effect of the NAD/NADH ratio on glycolysis might serve as an additional explanation for the observed decrease of 3PG, 2PG, and PEP during a glucose pulse. The responses measured during the ethanol pulse were used to evaluate the allosteric regulation of glycolysis. Our results confirm that FBP stimulates pyruvate kinase and suggest that this effect is pronounced. Furthermore, it appears that PEP does not play an important role in the allosteric regulation of phosphofructo kinase.
