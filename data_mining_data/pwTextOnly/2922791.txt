Forty-two chemical substances, chosen because they might influence red cell metabolism, were screened for effect on red cell adenosine triphosphate and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) levels during storage in CPD or CPDA-1 at 4 degrees C. Of these substances, six appeared on initial screening to increase 2,3 DPG levels during storage; on repeated examination, four compounds, i.e., oxalate, glyoxalate, ethyl oxaloacetate, and L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine, consistently increased 2,3 DPG levels during storage. It was shown that glyoxalate was converted rapidly to oxalate in blood, presumably through the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. Ethyl oxaloacetate is known to hydrolyze, giving rise to oxalate. Thus, the effect of both glyoxalate and ethyl oxaloacetate can be explained by the formation of oxalate, a compound already known to increase 2,3 DPG levels. The effect of L-phenylalanyl-L-alanine remains to be explained, but it may be hydrolyzed to L-alanine and L-phenylalanine, both of which are thought to have the capacity to increase red cell 2,3 DPG levels by inhibiting pyruvate kinase activity.
