BACKGROUND: Advances in melanoma treatment through targeted inhibition of oncogenic BRAF are limited owing to the development of acquired resistance. The involvement of BRAFV600E in metabolic reprogramming of melanoma cells provides a rationale for co-targeting metabolism as a therapeutic approach. METHODS: We examined the effects of dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, on the growth and metabolic activity of human melanoma cell lines. The combined effect of DCA and the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was investigated in BRAFV600E -mutated melanoma cell lines. Vemurafenib-resistant cell lines were established in vitro and their sensitivity to DCA was tested. RESULTS: DCA induced a reduction in glycolytic activity and intracellular ATP levels, and inhibited cellular growth. Co-treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells with DCA and vemurafenib induced a greater reduction in intracellular ATP levels and cellular growth than either compound alone. In addition, melanoma cells with in vitro acquired resistance to vemurafenib retained their sensitivity to DCA. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DCA potentiates the effect of vemurafenib through a cooperative attenuation of energy production. Furthermore, the demonstration of retained sensitivity to DCA in melanoma cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib could have implications for melanoma treatment.
